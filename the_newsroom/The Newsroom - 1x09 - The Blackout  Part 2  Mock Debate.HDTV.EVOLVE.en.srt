1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:03,413
I want some sort of document about
what we've been trying to do here.

2
00:00:03,447 --> 00:00:07,654
I get to pick the writer.
I'm going with <i>New York Magazine</i> and you.

3
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:08,855
What about our history?

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,131
- You dated him?
- Brian Brenner is the guy I cheated on Will with.

5
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,833
- Wow.
- Tell me about this new debate.

6
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:17,471
<i>The RNC is looking at Will
to possibly host a debate,</i>

7
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:21,078
and Will and Mac have an idea for
a new debate format we want to show them.

8
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:23,681
Whose idea was it to not cover
the Casey Anthony trial?

9
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,516
- It was mine.
- It was hers.

10
00:00:25,551 --> 00:00:27,951
Half our audience changed
the channel in one week.

11
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:30,886
I want the debate.
If that means we have to be Jerry Springer

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,119
for a few weeks,
I'm willing to pay that price.

13
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:36,353
The night we got bin Laden
I got a call from an anonymous source.

14
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:39,258
He works in software
engineering at the NSA.

15
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:41,261
We have to start vetting him
and the documents.

16
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,397
You got some tweets
from Congressman Weiner.

17
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,365
And I've got copies
of them right here.

18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,733
We can do a pre-tape.

19
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,967
- Will.
- Yes, I'm sure I want to do this.

20
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:52,436
God, please give me a sign
I'm not doing a big thing badly.

21
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,928
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

22
00:02:40,582 --> 00:02:42,350
<i>Backup generators should
have come on already.</i>

23
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:43,985
<i>Maybe it just
needs a minute.</i>

24
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:46,021
It doesn't just need a minute.
It's an emergency generator

25
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,622
that's supposed to make
a seamless handoff

26
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:49,625
so if this happens
during a show-- Herb?

27
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:51,160
Power's out
in the whole building.

28
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,496
It's been explained
to me 19 different ways

29
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,598
how we can never
lose power in the studio.

30
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:57,100
What about all
the redundancies?

31
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:59,102
There was a round of budget cuts
before you got here.

32
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:00,837
- <i>And they cut some of the redundancies...</i>
- Don't say it.

33
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,906
- <i>because they thought they were redundant.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:05,142
Okay.

35
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:07,544
- That's a good sign, right?
- Those are battery powered.

36
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:10,046
- When should I start to worry?
- I'd have started already.

37
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,081
<i>Electricians are on their way.</i>

38
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,183
We lost power in the studio.

39
00:03:14,218 --> 00:03:15,986
What makes you say that?

40
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,159
Everybody, listen up.
It's the whole building.

41
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,461
We've sent for maintenance
to check on our generator.

42
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,896
They should be here in a minute.

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,198
They've got to walk up 25 floors.

44
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:31,935
Okay, they should be here
in a couple of hours.

45
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,537
Neal, I want you
to be in charge

46
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:36,139
of rationing battery life
for laptops and cell phones.

47
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,341
- I have a question.
- Yes?

48
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,842
What if the power
doesn't go back on?

49
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:40,677
I don't think that's
a realistic possibility.

50
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:43,681
I don't mean ever. I mean what if
the power doesn't go on by showtime?

51
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,850
Do we have a contingency?

52
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,687
No.

53
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,724
Mac?

54
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:54,625
A miracle.

55
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,766
A miracle happens.

56
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:06,370
We become a team again.

57
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,839
We all hate this, right?

58
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,442
We're gonna hate it more after
10 minutes of no air conditioning.

59
00:04:11,476 --> 00:04:14,278
No, not the power outage.
We hate what we're doing.

60
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,947
We hate that we're covering

61
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:18,782
Casey Anthony
and Anthony Weiner.

62
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,418
We hate that we have to do it
to save the ratings.

63
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:23,420
We hate that we have
to bump important stories.

64
00:04:23,454 --> 00:04:26,723
And we're starting to be
not very pleasant people to be around.

65
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:29,793
Guys, this is real.

66
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,328
I'm not making this up.

67
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:34,164
Just a minute ago when
I was prepping for a pretape

68
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:36,066
with that idiot who's
still sitting in the studio--

69
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,068
- Are you talking about me?
- No!

70
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,869
Yes. When I was prepping
for her pretape I said,

71
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:44,640
"God, please show me a sign
that I'm not doing a big thing badly."

72
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:48,912
And right that second
all the power went out.

73
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:51,581
And so obviously I thought,
"There's my answer."

74
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:54,417
Raise your hand if Mac's
freaking you the hell out right now.

75
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,953
No, listen to me!

76
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,654
Just tell us how we do the show
if the power doesn't--

77
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,292
By being a team again.
And that was God's plan.

78
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:03,760
Keep God out of this
and talk more about electricity.

79
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:06,029
We do the show outside
right in the plaza.

80
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,398
- <i>How?</i>
- Yeah, we can do this.

81
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:10,567
What do we need?
A desk, a camera,

82
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,103
some microphones,
and a way to beam a signal into space.

83
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,604
The grips take apart the anchor desk.

84
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,673
And carry it down 25 flights?

85
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,275
You bet your ass they do.

86
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,043
We can use a single
tripod-mounted handheld.

87
00:05:20,078 --> 00:05:22,279
- We park a sat truck out there.
- That's right.

88
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,515
- Run the video and graphics through Washington.
- Yes!

89
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,685
I'm in your sight line the whole time,

90
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,720
in your ear and standing next to camera.

91
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,656
I'll have a laptop with
a constant iNews connection.

92
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,358
How do we get power to
editors to run the Avids?

93
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:33,759
What did they do in Apollo 13?

94
00:05:33,794 --> 00:05:35,628
They shut down all the power
in the command module

95
00:05:35,662 --> 00:05:38,063
and siphoned it into the LEM.
I don't think that's gonna work here.

96
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:41,400
What would they have done if
there was a hardware store in space?

97
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,368
- Buy a generator.
- We're gonna buy two.

98
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:45,737
One goes in an Avid bay
and the other stays downstairs.

99
00:05:45,772 --> 00:05:47,673
- What time does the sun set tonight?
- 8:37.

100
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:49,274
<i>Why in the world
would you know that?</i>

101
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,709
One of those things.

102
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:53,144
We'll need HMis with gels
for the top half hour

103
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,513
and incandescents for the bottom half.

104
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:56,281
We need the NYPD for security

105
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:59,852
and we need to trust each other.

106
00:05:59,887 --> 00:06:02,188
Does anybody think
we're not good enough

107
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,990
- to pull this off?
- No!

108
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:06,426
- <i>Should I still be sitting here?</i>
- I'm so sorry, Sandy.

109
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,461
I know you had your heart
set on entertaining us

110
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,463
with private details of a man
you were sexting with

111
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,065
and maybe a <i>Playboy</i> spread,

112
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,700
but we're not able to do pretape.

113
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:16,770
So if you want to do the show,
you're gonna have to do it live.

114
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:18,305
I already committed to Fox,

115
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,672
and no offense,
but it's a bigger audience.

116
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:22,508
Shoot!
Does anybody think we can't do this?

117
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:25,512
- No!
- This is a blessing in disguise.

118
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:27,080
I say the power going out

119
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,616
is the best thing that
ever happened to us.

120
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,618
I say the power going out

121
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,187
is what is gonna save this--

122
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:36,923
Son of a bitch!

123
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:44,663
You're a freaking riot,
you know that?

124
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,373
I meant to tell you,

125
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,375
you should use the word
bombshell more

126
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,877
in the Casey Anthony
coverage tonight.

127
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,189
Sandy, you're back in business.

128
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,058
- <i>Great.</i>
- Let's go.

129
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:18,295
Bombshell after bombshell today
in the trial of Casey Anthony

130
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,631
<i>for the murder of her
two-year-old daughter Caylee.</i>

131
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>Casey's brother,
Lee Anthony, took the stand</i>

132
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:26,337
<i>to testify about the events
of the night of July 15, 2008,</i>

133
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,039
<i>when Caylee was reported missing.</i>

134
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,008
- Watch and listen. It's riveting stuff.
<i>- Roll five.</i>

135
00:07:31,043 --> 00:07:33,544
<i>When you asked your sister</i>

136
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,280
<i>why won't you allow us
to see Caylee,</i>

137
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,749
what do you recall her saying?

138
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:41,752
I told Detective Edwards that she said--

139
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:44,154
I'm paraphrasing--

140
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,323
"Because maybe I'm a spiteful bitch."

141
00:07:46,358 --> 00:07:49,059
Lee Anthony described
his odyssey that month

142
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,627
trying to find his missing niece.

143
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,229
Oddly, he was never questioned

144
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,032
about the defense's claim
he molested Casey.

145
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:57,034
For the latest,
we're joined live from Orlando

146
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,603
<i>by ACN's Selena Machado.</i>

147
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:00,905
- Can you describe how you're feeling right now?
- No.

148
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,408
Selena, how did Casey seem today
during her brother's testimony?

149
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,343
Well, her demeanor
was different with Lee

150
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:07,911
than it was with her mother.

151
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,214
The normally outspoken
Democratic New York congressman

152
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,016
is suddenly tongue-tied and evasive.

153
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,752
Here he is again today with
<i>The Today Show</i>'s Luke Russert.

154
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,754
- <i>Roll 16.</i> 
<i>- That's not a picture of you?</i>

155
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,890
<i>You know,
I can't say with certitude.</i>

156
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,659
My system was hacked.
Pictures can be manipulated.

157
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:24,062
Pictures can be dropped
in and inserted.

158
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:26,131
Someone committed
a prank on me.

159
00:08:26,165 --> 00:08:27,900
Somehow got access
to my Twitter account

160
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,836
and right away put up a picture

161
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:32,438
<i>that made fun of the name Weiner.</i>

162
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:35,174
Hey, we can be doing
mock debate prep during this.

163
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:40,247
Hey, debate prep.

164
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:43,750
<i>You don't have to watch this.</i>

165
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:45,752
<i>We don't know for sure
what happened here.</i>

166
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,621
I spoke earlier today with Sandy Witless,

167
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:50,023
- <i>a bartender--</i>
- Whiddles, like carving wood.

168
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:53,093
Excuse me, Sandy Whiddles,
a bartender here in Manhattan

169
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:56,463
who had been tweeting with
Congressman Weiner for the past several months.

170
00:08:56,497 --> 00:08:58,398
- Here's that interview.
- Roll 22.

171
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,467
- <i>Thank you for speaking to us, Sandy.</i>
- Thank you.

172
00:09:00,501 --> 00:09:03,070
When did you become a
Twitter follower of the congressman?

173
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:05,172
<i>Let me say first that
I was more than a follower.</i>

174
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,975
<i>We had a relationship,
which is obvious when you read the texts.</i>

175
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,278
Does he usually smoke at his desk?

176
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:13,047
<i>I have copies of
the texts right here.</i>

177
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,615
I know you're eager to read the tweets.

178
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:16,417
- We'll get to those in a moment.
- Okay, because--

179
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:18,352
<i>Did the congressman ever
talk to you or tweet to you</i>

180
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:20,821
anything that he was working on
in one of his committees?

181
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:23,557
No. I have copies
of the tweets right here.

182
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,725
Two minutes and 20 seconds
in the C block

183
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,710
to educate the public on the most
irresponsible economic inaction in my lifetime.

184
00:09:28,731 --> 00:09:30,631
I know, it's all upside down
because of Casey Anthony.

185
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,534
- Once ratings are back up--
- We're committing journalistic malpractice.

186
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:35,370
Fortunately,
there's no such thing.

187
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,938
How great would it be if there was?

188
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:38,606
I can understand your frustration.

189
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,642
- What's your thing again?
- It's a website for trolls.

190
00:09:40,676 --> 00:09:42,944
They get together and talk
about their conquests.

191
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,547
And I want to produce a story
and Mac's given me the go-ahead

192
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,182
- to go to the next level.
- Go on the website?

193
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:48,850
Yeah, but I can't get
in the conversation

194
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:50,752
till I can point to another
website and show how I've--

195
00:09:50,786 --> 00:09:52,721
- Been an asshole?
- Yes.

196
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:55,423
I have to go onto a message board
and disrupt the conversation

197
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:56,758
to the extent that havoc ensues.

198
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:58,726
Then I can go on the troll website
and brag about it.

199
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,261
But you don't want to do
something or say something

200
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:01,696
- that would hurt someone you don't know.
- Right.

201
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,065
You want to say things
that would hurt me.

202
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

203
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,770
What website?

204
00:10:08,804 --> 00:10:10,472
You've heard of EconomyBrain.com?

205
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:13,441
Yes, it's a financial news aggregate blog
and discussion forum

206
00:10:13,475 --> 00:10:15,477
that attracts an intelligent
level of debate.

207
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:18,080
And the commenters have
a very high opinion of your analyses.

208
00:10:18,114 --> 00:10:19,581
So you'd like my permission to--

209
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:22,484
Jump in there and invent heinous
and incendiary lies about you,

210
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,619
end the intelligent debate,
and start a whole new one

211
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,689
about, say,
whether or not you're a whore.

212
00:10:27,723 --> 00:10:29,457
My dad has friends
who are economists, too.

213
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,092
So with Father's Day
just around the corner,

214
00:10:31,126 --> 00:10:33,361
- this'll save me the trouble of shopping for him.
- I know.

215
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:36,131
Just print out the whole whore debate
and put it in a nice frame for him.

216
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,066
It would be my first story.

217
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,636
And I really think it's a good one.

218
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,643
I think so, too.

219
00:10:47,678 --> 00:10:49,779
Just let me know when it's over.

220
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:53,483
- You're the greatest.
- I really am.

221
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,728
This is Hang Chew's.

222
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,797
The staff adopted it as their hangout

223
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,600
'cause they get cheap
food and drinks until 9:00.

224
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,270
- Can you spell that?
- N-I-N-E O-C--

225
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,073
Okay.

226
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,309
Is it important that you
treat me like I'm an asshole?

227
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:22,146
I wouldn't say
important so much as

228
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,581
- it just sort of feels right.
- I know you'd agree it would be better

229
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,449
- to keep our personal past out of this.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,986
That said, I'd like to point out that
you broke up with me, too.

231
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,822
- Listen, Brian--
- I broke up with you, we got back together,

232
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,824
and then you broke up with me.
Those are the facts.

233
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,459
I sure hope we're
on the record for this.

234
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,695
And during the second act,
you were with Will behind my back.

235
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,764
Once again,
I was with you behind Will's back.

236
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,134
Yeah, and it makes me feel great
when you say that,

237
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,069
but I do think we should
stick to the story.

238
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,938
The story is this:
Will is a heavyweight.

239
00:11:46,973 --> 00:11:49,275
And for a long time he was
pretending to be a lightweight.

240
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,111
- Because lightweights get higher ratings.
- Yes.

241
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,714
Will's a lonely guy, isn't he?

242
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,920
- Is he--
- He's lonely.

243
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:02,823
He doesn't care about ratings
because of the money.

244
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:04,624
He cares about ratings
because the audience

245
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,860
makes him feel less lonely.

246
00:12:08,263 --> 00:12:10,231
What do you plan on
writing about, Brian?

247
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:13,267
I don't know yet.

248
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,738
I have to talk to Sloan.
Excuse me one second.

249
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:22,509
He is a lonely guy.

250
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,346
I don't know if that
started around the time

251
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,948
I told him I'd been
sleeping with you,

252
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,751
but I'll bet it didn't help.

253
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,558
Governor Pawlenty,
the possibility exists

254
00:12:37,592 --> 00:12:39,794
that New Hampshire
will become the 23rd state

255
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:41,829
to pass right-to-work legislation.

256
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:45,467
As president, would you support
a federal right-to-work law?

257
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,269
- <i>You should have this.</i>
- Give me a second.

258
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:52,373
Try: for much of my life
my father was a Teamster truck driver.

259
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:54,442
My brothers and sisters were in unions.

260
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:57,011
- I was in a union.
- We grew up in a blue-collar town.

261
00:12:57,046 --> 00:12:59,014
We live in the United States of America.

262
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:01,316
Governor, we know where we live.
Would you support--

263
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,220
People shouldn't be forced to belong to
or be a member of any organization.

264
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:07,723
Yes, I strongly support
right-to-work legislation.

265
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:10,192
That's what
an answer sounds like.

266
00:13:10,226 --> 00:13:12,995
- Can I talk to you a sec?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:16,866
Just the fact that they're debating

268
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,701
- whether or not to raise the debt ceiling--
- I'm trying.

269
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,503
I need to find a Casey Anthony guest
no one else has.

270
00:13:21,538 --> 00:13:24,373
And hopefully I won't be able to do it.

271
00:13:24,408 --> 00:13:28,511
- I'll be rooting against you.
- Good.

272
00:13:28,545 --> 00:13:30,913
- You doing all right over there?
- With him?

273
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,715
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

274
00:13:32,749 --> 00:13:35,518
'Cause you give me the signal
and I can just get in there

275
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,287
- and, you know.
- What?

276
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:40,422
- I don't know.
- Okay.

277
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:43,092
- Debt ceiling.
- Yeah.

278
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,429
<i>Just hang in there
one more day.</i>

279
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,364
It's not one more day.
It's another month.

280
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,899
The mock debate's tomorrow.

281
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:52,368
And once that's over,
we need the numbers to protect you from Leona.

282
00:13:52,403 --> 00:13:54,070
Not if Charlie's guy can do it for us.

283
00:13:54,104 --> 00:13:55,571
And if he doesn't
turn out to be credible?

284
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:58,274
Then-- I don't know.
Let's take it one day at a time.

285
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:00,676
<i>And get a guest
that's promotable.</i>

286
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,717
What are the flowers?

287
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:09,118
Nothing.

288
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:10,920
- Who are they from?
- I don't know.

289
00:14:10,955 --> 00:14:12,388
They didn't come with a card?

290
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:14,357
- They did.
- The card wasn't signed?

291
00:14:14,391 --> 00:14:16,225
- It was.
- Was it another threat?

292
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,894
- No.
- What am I missing?

293
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,629
<i>Do you really want this
on your plate right now?</i>

294
00:14:19,663 --> 00:14:21,698
The flowers aren't for me,
they aren't from me,

295
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,834
they're just living in
my office for a little while.

296
00:14:23,901 --> 00:14:26,036
Can you be satisfied with that?

297
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:31,875
- Are they for me?
- Let's go.

298
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:34,377
- Speaker Gingrich.
<i>- Yes?</i>

299
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,014
As a candidate for the
Republican nomination for president,

300
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,616
you signed a fidelity pledge
promising to be faithful to your wife.

301
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:42,519
- Now hold it right there.
- Didn't you also make that same pledge

302
00:14:42,553 --> 00:14:44,521
at your three marriage ceremonies?

303
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:47,190
I find it absolutely disgusting
that the liberal media--

304
00:14:47,225 --> 00:14:48,993
- Fine.
- No, that would be his answer.

305
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:51,162
I know. Are these guys gonna
be ready for tomorrow?

306
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:53,264
- Absolutely.
- We blow the mock debate,

307
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:56,033
we've been doing Casey Anthony
and Anthony Weiner for nothing.

308
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:56,922
They understand.

309
00:14:56,946 --> 00:14:59,069
The debate is the only reason
we're scared of the numbers.

310
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,538
- <i>Right.</i>
- The only reason.

311
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:03,040
Right.

312
00:15:03,074 --> 00:15:05,542
We need a Casey Anthony guest
no one else has.

313
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,611
<i>Let me start here.</i>

314
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:11,281
<i>By any chance does anyone
know anyone who knows anyone</i>

315
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:13,450
who knows Casey Anthony?

316
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,888
Who?

317
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:20,057
My roommate Lisa
went to high school with her.

318
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:21,592
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

319
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,561
Why didn't you--
Get her on the show.

320
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,297
She's already been approached by
everyone including the agent.

321
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:28,766
- Dylan Kagin.
- She doesn't want to talk.

322
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,968
- Convince her.
- She really doesn't want to talk.

323
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:33,104
Be a producer.
Do you want me to talk to her?

324
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:36,407
No, I can do it.

325
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:39,310
When you've got her booked,
let me know so they can start the promos.

326
00:15:39,344 --> 00:15:41,211
Do whatever you have to do.

327
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:47,952
<i>Okay.</i>

328
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,291
<i>I like it. I do.
But does it say Tonys?</i>

329
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:57,561
Well, it's the Tonys. You're gonna be
the youngest person there by about 50 years.

330
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:59,096
You know what I mean, right?

331
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,798
I think it looks spectacular on you.

332
00:16:00,832 --> 00:16:03,200
It's so hard.
I'm just not sure it's for the Tonys.

333
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,402
What about Galliano?

334
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:08,238
We, um--
We stopped carrying Galliano

335
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:11,174
after he, you know,
came out in support of the Holocaust.

336
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,943
I mean, I don't agree with him,
but that's no reason to condemn him for life.

337
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:17,180
If only the Germans had had the same attitude.
I told you on the phone--

338
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,216
- I know, that's why we came in person.
- We?

339
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,718
- I'm just here in charge of morale.
- I'm with a customer.

340
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:24,020
- We're not in a hurry.
- We're actually in a huge hurry.

341
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,956
And I'm actually at my job
where I work on commission.

342
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,258
And I'm with a customer,
so I'll be done when she's done.

343
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,360
- Is that her?
- You mean the only person in the store?

344
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:31,495
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

345
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:34,097
Miss, I'm just a random
heterosexual guy

346
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:37,667
from off the street and I think
that dress looks great on you.

347
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,135
Don't even look at anything else.

348
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,870
Buy that dress and wear
it out of the store.

349
00:16:40,904 --> 00:16:42,571
He's just a--
Don't worry.

350
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:44,973
- It would have meant more if you'd said you were gay.
- Why is that?

351
00:16:45,008 --> 00:16:46,375
I think I'm gonna try on the Di Santo.

352
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:48,143
Sure. Can I get you
another glass of wine?

353
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,279
Ooh, I'd love that.
Thank you.

354
00:16:52,349 --> 00:16:54,917
They're counting on me.
You'd be a big exclusive.

355
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:56,919
It's what's called a get.
It's promotable.

356
00:16:56,953 --> 00:16:58,286
And we need things
that are promotable

357
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,188
so we can get daytime viewers
to stay with us for the story.

358
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:03,057
Not for nothing, but you've never used
any of those words before.

359
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,094
Well, sure, I have.
But not in that order.

360
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:09,063
Guys, it makes me sick.
It's an unspeakable horror that's happened.

361
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:11,532
It's not a television show
and I'm not joining the cast.

362
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:13,734
And by the way, a week ago you guys
would have said the same exact thing.

363
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:17,004
- A week ago we weren't fu--
- This is bananas!

364
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,774
Well, the bodice hugs
your body perfectly.

365
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:21,276
Look how it shows off your legs.
See that?

366
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,011
- I do.
- You just got two inches taller.

367
00:17:23,045 --> 00:17:24,912
- Okay, but the big question--
- Does it say Tonys?

368
00:17:24,947 --> 00:17:26,547
- Miss.
- Oh, God.

369
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:28,883
That dress screams Tonys.

370
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,184
You're gonna win in that dress.

371
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:32,153
Oh, God, no.
I'm not a nominee.

372
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,955
That's how good the dress is.

373
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,590
You wear that dress and they'll just start

374
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,358
throwing Tony Awards at your head.

375
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,260
You, I promise,
will have skull contusions

376
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:41,296
if you wear that dress to the Tonys.

377
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,630
I'd be terrible at this job.

378
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:44,999
Yeah, I have a McQueen
that you may love.

379
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:47,335
And you know what?
If you take it right now, it's on the house.

380
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:48,770
- I'm afraid it's not.
- Well, then it's on me.

381
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:50,571
- It's $11,000.
- For a dress?!

382
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:52,640
Once again, I work on commission.

383
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,076
That's three times
what I paid for my car.

384
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,078
- Let me know if you need any help in there.
- Thank you.

385
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:00,281
A week ago we weren't screwed.

386
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:02,817
I knew her, that's it.
We cut third period together.

387
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,218
Will's gonna treat you very gently.

388
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:07,055
Well, guess what--
Did she kill children during Spanish?

389
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,524
- You can provide insight--
- No, I can't.

390
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:12,093
No, I can't.
I can't provide insight.

391
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:14,729
I have no earthly idea how she--

392
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:16,531
How this could have happened.

393
00:18:16,565 --> 00:18:19,101
I can't provide insight and I can't stand
the people who think they can.

394
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:21,636
<i>Lisa, I need a little help
with these buttons.</i>

395
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:23,638
Sure.

396
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:27,542
You know what
these pants cost me?

397
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:30,011
- $30.
- That's right.

398
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:33,949
And they look just as good
as the ones that cost $40.

399
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,653
<i>You think they're
kissing in there?</i>

400
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:40,990
Do <i>you</i> think
they're kissing in there?

401
00:18:41,024 --> 00:18:45,195
If I was a woman,
I'd spend the whole day kissing other women.

402
00:18:45,262 --> 00:18:47,897
I don't understand gay men
or straight women.

403
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,532
You know you're talking out loud, right?

404
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:51,967
Take a look.
I think it's whimsical and romantic,

405
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:53,769
but it's still chic.

406
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:55,771
- I love it.
- Look how it defines your waist.

407
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:57,606
- I love it!
- We have a winner.

408
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:59,976
- <i>Can we accessorize?</i>
- No, I'm sorry, miss.

409
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,078
We need to speak to Lisa
for just one minute.

410
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:04,981
You can browse in the accessories section
and we'll give her right back to you.

411
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,249
This isn't her fault, it's ours.

412
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:09,385
- Please patronize this store.
- What?

413
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,053
Take a look at the jade earrings
and I'll be right with you.

414
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:13,289
- Okay.
- Am I not making myself clear?

415
00:19:13,323 --> 00:19:15,091
Lisa, look at me.

416
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,226
You know that there is
no way we'd be asking you

417
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,895
to do something like this
if it wasn't important.

418
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:22,999
We got ambushed by the trial
at the worst possible time.

419
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:26,302
There's a new debate format we want to
show to reps from the RNC tomorrow.

420
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:30,139
And if we can't keep the ratings going up,
it's not gonna matter.

421
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:33,776
<i>We've been working on this for months
and it's important.</i>

422
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,977
And it's a good thing for everybody.

423
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,013
<i>We can debate whether the ends
justify the means--</i>

424
00:19:38,047 --> 00:19:40,115
Will and Mackenzie are counting on you?

425
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:47,956
I don't have anything to say.

426
00:19:47,991 --> 00:19:51,026
You won't be asked anything
you don't know the answer to.

427
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:54,996
Okay, what do I do?

428
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,732
Come to the newsroom at 7:00 tonight.

429
00:19:57,767 --> 00:20:00,701
Oh, thanks. I owe you one.

430
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:02,236
I owe you more than one.

431
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,040
Let's go.

432
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:16,016
Um, I don't know if it was clear
from my e-mails and phone calls,

433
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,818
but I've been wooing you.

434
00:20:17,853 --> 00:20:21,689
Still trying to get that second first date.

435
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:25,727
And yet I can tell from
the way you're staring at me

436
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:29,063
right now that this
isn't the best moment.

437
00:20:29,098 --> 00:20:32,167
You see that?
I was able to tell without your saying anything.

438
00:20:32,201 --> 00:20:35,237
Our minds are in sync.

439
00:20:35,304 --> 00:20:37,639
But there's not
an ounce of quit in me,

440
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:41,009
- so I'll woo you when--
- What the hell are you doing?

441
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:43,044
All right, then.
7:00, it's a date.

442
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,613
Not really. I'm not crazy.

443
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:47,749
Thank you.

444
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,720
Yeah?

445
00:20:52,755 --> 00:20:54,623
You wanted to see me?

446
00:20:54,657 --> 00:20:56,925
It's 100 degrees outside.
You're wearing a jacket?

447
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,061
Because it's Ice Station
Zebra in my office.

448
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:01,697
- If you have any fresh fish you need to store--
- Those are yours.

449
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:03,633
They were delivered
for you this morning.

450
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:07,036
Jim signed for them
and looked at the card,

451
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,938
which you can see
isn't in an envelope.

452
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,606
Jim signed for them?

453
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:13,042
He said Maggie didn't see.
She wasn't around.

454
00:21:24,854 --> 00:21:27,489
Maggie and I have broken up a lot
in the last year and a half.

455
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:33,996
I've--

456
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,864
I've gotten that sense.

457
00:21:35,899 --> 00:21:38,467
- When we break up--
<i>- You go out with other women.</i>

458
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,235
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do?

459
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,005
- I'm not judging you.
- Then we get back together.

460
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,406
Do you tell the other women

461
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:46,175
that you've gotten back together
with your girlfriend?

462
00:21:46,209 --> 00:21:48,377
We're talking about people that
I've been on one or two dates with.

463
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,713
Does Maggie know that you've been
out with other women?

464
00:21:50,781 --> 00:21:52,248
No.

465
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:54,284
Does Gina know
that you're with Maggie?

466
00:21:54,318 --> 00:21:55,552
- Jenna.
- Hmm?

467
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:58,254
Jenna. These are from--
Her name is Jenna.

468
00:21:58,288 --> 00:21:59,856
You remember when
I didn't care at all

469
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,091
about the lives of the people
who worked here?

470
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:05,261
- Yeah.
- Those were the days.

471
00:22:05,328 --> 00:22:09,731
- Time to go.
- Yeah.

472
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,833
Uh, I can't walk through
the newsroom with these.

473
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,468
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

474
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,436
- <i>Hey, Don.</i>
- Yeah?

475
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm doing the right thing, right?

476
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:22,676
To do a little wrong to do a big right.

477
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,277
Get the debate.

478
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,613
- Was that Shakespeare?
- Almost.

479
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,514
- Okay.
- And I'm doing the right thing?

480
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,650
No. You're either lying to Maggie
or you're lying to Gina.

481
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,852
Jenna. And I just backed you up
with almost Shakespeare.

482
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,221
You couldn't throw me a bone?

483
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:38,224
I've got to go.

484
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:48,333
- That was a cliché.
<i>- I know.</i>

485
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,704
<i>But if you stand in the rain without a jacket,
you're gonna get a cold.</i>

486
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,506
And if you have
a physically abusive father

487
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,241
who abandons you
and your family,

488
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,843
you're gonna be 1,000 times
more sensitive to betrayal

489
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,247
than the average person who's already
extremely sensitive to betrayal.

490
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,748
I miss encyclopedias.

491
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:06,050
I always wanted to have
a full set of encyclopedias.

492
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,419
You know, you pull down S
off the shelf,

493
00:23:08,454 --> 00:23:10,721
flip to a page,
you read about, I don't know,

494
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,424
Salic law and why a woman can't inherit
the French throne.

495
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,960
- You can Google it.
<i>- That's my point.</i>

496
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,328
You have to know
what you're looking for.

497
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,463
You can't browse
for anything anymore.

498
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,633
Anyway, last night I was looking up
signal intelligence intercepts

499
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,401
and whether they leave
a fiber-optic footprint.

500
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,336
Is it important that
I know what that meant?

501
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,774
No. We've got a whistle-blower who's giving us
a big story and we have to vet him.

502
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,810
But what happened was
I was reading about fiber-optic footprints

503
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,812
and a couple of clicks later, I was on

504
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,281
a relationship advice website
called "Help Me Rhonda."

505
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,718
A woman wrote to Rhonda saying that
her husband was cheating on her

506
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,521
and Rhonda suggested that
the woman had to examine

507
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,891
what her role was in the cheating.
It made me crazy.

508
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,460
Do you think it could possibly
have been the woman's fault?

509
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,862
Are we saying that now?

510
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,597
What I don't believe
is that a couple clicks

511
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:55,401
took you from fiber-optic
footprints to "Help Me Rhonda."

512
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,403
If you went to a relationship
advice website, just say so.

513
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,239
It was the middle of the night.
There was nothing else to read.

514
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,275
Except the entire rest
of the Internet.

515
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,079
Do you and Rhonda honestly believe
that I share some of the blame

516
00:24:06,114 --> 00:24:09,082
or even a small part of the blame
for Mackenzie cheating with Brian?

517
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:11,251
- Do you?
- No.

518
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,086
Fine.

519
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,055
'Cause that's about
the dumbest thing I've ever read.

520
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,025
And I'll tell you what else,
I don't even think Rhonda's her real name.

521
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,526
- Yeah, look--
- Maybe it is.

522
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,361
I don't know. But she's a moron.

523
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:22,862
You weren't part of the equation.

524
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:25,131
Ruined a perfectly good Beach Boys song.

525
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:27,200
Wait, what do you mean?

526
00:24:27,234 --> 00:24:29,435
I can't really assess
someone I haven't met.

527
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,770
Then why did you say it?

528
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:32,037
Because I can assess
someone I haven't met.

529
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:33,906
My father left me volumes
on the two of you.

530
00:24:33,941 --> 00:24:35,541
I had to get an extra filing cabinet.

531
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:38,478
How was I not part of the equation?

532
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:41,782
Mackenzie got dumped by Brian.
She got rejected.

533
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:44,318
People react to that in different ways.

534
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:46,187
When Brian started calling her again,

535
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:48,589
she saw the chance to get
unrejected and she took it.

536
00:24:48,623 --> 00:24:50,457
You weren't even part of the equation.

537
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:52,526
<i>But once she got unrejected,
she realized</i>

538
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,694
that she wasn't in love
with Brian in the first place,

539
00:24:54,729 --> 00:24:57,764
that she was in love with you,
and she confessed the whole thing.

540
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:00,800
- Not right away.
- Who cares about not right away?

541
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:03,102
When she thought you were
going to propose to her--

542
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:05,771
Do you remember when I came
in here yesterday without an appointment

543
00:25:05,806 --> 00:25:07,873
and interrupted your session
with another patient?

544
00:25:07,908 --> 00:25:09,442
I do remember that.
It was yesterday.

545
00:25:09,476 --> 00:25:12,211
And you said that the trick was
to forgive Mackenzie.

546
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:15,013
- Yeah.
- I actually know that.

547
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:18,818
Intellectually, in my brain,
I know Mackenzie deserves to be forgiven.

548
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:20,453
I understood everything you said.

549
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,956
I understand she's taken every
punishment I've given her,

550
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,659
including having Brian hang around
the office and write his story.

551
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:28,027
I understand she's completely
devoted to the show.

552
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:30,563
I understand mistakes.
I understand time has passed.

553
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:34,199
I understand all of that.
So why can't I forgive her?

554
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:36,468
<i>Because you weren't rejected.</i>

555
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,304
You were betrayed.

556
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,912
How's it going, Sampat?

557
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,348
Well, the problem with people
who post on EconomyBrain

558
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,150
is they're not easily distracted.

559
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,718
Damn those economists
and their adult attention spans.

560
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,086
They're not making it easy for me.

561
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,388
But a popular discussion at the moment

562
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:01,224
is a recent article projecting
US credit rating fallout

563
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,059
as a result of the debt ceiling standoff.

564
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,228
Yes, I heard that on the news.
No, wait, I didn't.

565
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,496
I heard about Casey Anthony instead.

566
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,165
Well, that's where I jumped in.

567
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,000
I said if I can balance my checkbook,

568
00:26:10,034 --> 00:26:12,102
why can't the government
balance its budget?

569
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:14,939
Mary, Mother of God,
am I sick of that insane analogy.

570
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,375
Balancing your checkbook
is to balancing the budget

571
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,111
as driving to the supermarket
is to landing on the moon!

572
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,513
See?

573
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,014
Ah.

574
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,849
- I got you a little upset.
- Yes.

575
00:26:24,884 --> 00:26:27,286
So once they were hooked on
telling me how stupid I am,

576
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,888
- I steered things in your direction.
- How?

577
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,390
- You really want to know?
- No.

578
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,392
- Good.
- Tell me anyway.

579
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,828
I said the media and government
are in a conspiracy cahoots--

580
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,897
- Conspiracy cahoots?
- I have to sound authentically moronic.

581
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,334
How are the media and the government
in a conspiracy cahoots?

582
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,436
By shoving your breasts in our face.

583
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:48,039
- Many angry posters came to your defense.
- Good.

584
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,375
- So I created a second user account.
- Of course.

585
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,443
And asserted it wasn't your breasts
that were so compelling,

586
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,613
- it was your blatantly slutty body movements.
- What evidence do you use--

587
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:58,015
I posted a link on your Wikipedia page
detailing your rise

588
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,684
from small-town stripper to big-time
financial news reporter.

589
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:03,320
- My Wikipedia page doesn't say that.
- Check again.

590
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,456
You're going to see an emotional response

591
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,292
on my face and a physical
response directed at yours.

592
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,261
It worked.

593
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,698
After two hours,
I had economic PhDs posting in all caps.

594
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:17,068
And then the site administrator
froze the thread.

595
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,804
All right.
And this is enough to get you accepted

596
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,907
- into the fraternity of the pitiful?
- Almost.

597
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,743
There's a sort of pledge process
for the fraternity of the pitiful.

598
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:26,244
And this will get me to level one.

599
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,814
Once I do that, I can get to level two
and swim with the professional trolls.

600
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,450
You're gonna be a good reporter.

601
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,020
And I like that someone
is working on news stories.

602
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,821
Well, for what it's worth,

603
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,623
I could really get behind a government

604
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,126
that was in a cahoots conspiracy
to shove your breasts in our face.

605
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,594
Aw.

606
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:45,596
Re-edit my Wikipedia page!

607
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,731
Soon.

608
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,475
He's on his way.

609
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,411
All right, what do you know so far?

610
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,480
- You got Lisa for tonight.
- They've already started promoing it.

611
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,449
What do you have on the NSA source?

612
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:07,150
He's not rock solid.

613
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,319
Shit.

614
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,288
He didn't do well on
his latest psych assessment.

615
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:14,258
- Oh, Christ.
<i>- They lowered his security clearance.</i>

616
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,792
He also violated a restraining order.

617
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,128
- An ex-wife?
- Yeah.

618
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:21,265
And he was arrested for solicitation in 1979.

619
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,369
- If you had this guy on a witness stand--
- I wouldn't put him on a witness stand.

620
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:27,204
Wait a minute.
He didn't score well on his psych exam,

621
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,373
but they didn't fire him.
They just lowered his security clearance.

622
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:32,076
Yes, he's stalking his ex-wife and, yes,
he tried to pick up a hooker,

623
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,111
but that doesn't mean
he's lying about the NSA.

624
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,147
All we have are the transcripts
of his testimony

625
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,749
and his testimony
doesn't mean anything to me yet.

626
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,918
Keep working.

627
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,231
- Excuse me.
- Which one of us?

628
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:54,633
Both.

629
00:28:54,668 --> 00:28:57,036
- I'm gonna speak in code.
- Why?

630
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,605
Because neither of you
can suggest to a guest

631
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,107
what they should say on the air.

632
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:04,143
- Okay. I understand.
- You do?

633
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:06,246
We've got Lisa.
We've promo'd her.

634
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,149
- She's done her job.
- She still has to show up.

635
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:11,918
But you don't care what she says
once she does.

636
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:15,422
I don't.

637
00:29:15,456 --> 00:29:18,158
So do me a favor.
This is for me.

638
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:21,261
Get some statistics on the number
of missing children cases this year?

639
00:29:21,295 --> 00:29:23,329
Yes, please.
And leave them for me

640
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:25,064
in the hair and makeup room.

641
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:32,906
- You understood that?
- Yeah, I cracked your code.

642
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,846
- Hey.
<i>- Hi.</i>

643
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,282
Jim, tell her she needs
a little blush to accentuate

644
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:43,484
those gorgeous cheekbones.
She refuses to listen.

645
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,653
I'm not auditioning for <i>Dancing With the Stars</i>.
My cheekbones are fine.

646
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,489
She's fine.

647
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:50,825
Could you give us the room a second?

648
00:29:57,499 --> 00:29:59,367
We're in a Vulcan mind meld again.

649
00:29:59,401 --> 00:30:01,336
I can tell this is a bad time to ask--

650
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,305
Maggie's my best friend.
She's actually my only friend, I think.

651
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,541
And I'd chop off my ears
before I'd hurt her.

652
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:08,210
You're basing this all
on the premise that--

653
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:11,480
Don's a good guy
who's not in love with her.

654
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:13,515
She knows it.

655
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:16,118
You're on deck, pal.

656
00:30:16,152 --> 00:30:18,987
I've been on deck for a year.
I'm nobody's second choice.

657
00:30:19,022 --> 00:30:21,223
Neither am I.

658
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:25,261
- Well, I-- I wasn't implying--
- Hey.

659
00:30:26,597 --> 00:30:29,165
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

660
00:30:30,968 --> 00:30:33,504
Listen, why don't you
take a look at this?

661
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,243
You can take that out there
with you if you want.

662
00:30:39,277 --> 00:30:40,978
Keep it right on the desk.

663
00:30:41,012 --> 00:30:43,147
Will and Mackenzie won't mind?

664
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,384
I'll see you after.

665
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:54,526
- I was gonna say--
- I want to learn this.

666
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,929
Please.
Yeah.

667
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:00,833
Thank you.

668
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:04,671
You don't have to say
anything you don't mean.

669
00:31:06,174 --> 00:31:08,008
Okay.

670
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:19,886
<i>I'm joined now
by Lisa Lambert,</i>

671
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,055
a friend of Casey Anthony's
from high school.

672
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:23,590
- Good evening, Lisa.
- Good evening.

673
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,625
- Did you know Casey well?
- I didn't.

674
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:28,728
And neither did any of the other people
showing up on TV claiming they did.

675
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,496
- But you took classes with her?
- Wow.

676
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:32,632
- Yes.
- Did she ever lose her temper?

677
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,001
<i>Yeah, and when she did,
we all said,</i>

678
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:37,103
"Oh, my God,
she's gonna kill her baby one day."

679
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:39,705
Fair enough. Let me ask you--

680
00:31:39,739 --> 00:31:42,007
There were 80 million children
reported missing last year.

681
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,510
<i>Actually,
I think you mean 800,000.</i>

682
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:46,311
Yes.

683
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:47,946
80 million would be way too many.

684
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:50,983
And I understand.
But this one involves a murder.

685
00:31:51,017 --> 00:31:53,452
Olivia Garcia was one year old

686
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,621
when she mysteriously died
at her babysitter's house.

687
00:31:55,655 --> 00:31:58,757
But Olivia Garcia had brown skin,
so we're not that interested.

688
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:01,026
Same with Triumph Skinner,
a seven-month-old

689
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:04,730
African-American who was rushed
to the hospital with a crushed skull.

690
00:32:04,764 --> 00:32:06,699
For some reason he's not keeping
Nancy Grace up at night.

691
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:08,767
Where are you getting these facts?

692
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,035
Google.

693
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,638
<i>Jariel Alexander died</i>

694
00:32:12,672 --> 00:32:15,307
<i>after being knocked unconscious
by his mother's boyfriend,</i>

695
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,643
<i>then scalded with boiling water</i>

696
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:19,111
<i>after soiling his pants at dinner.</i>

697
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,614
But Jariel's mother isn't pretty,
so what do we care?

698
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,015
I think you're making a very good point.

699
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,618
- Then I'd like to make one more.
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:32:28,722 --> 00:32:31,057
What if Casey Anthony
had wanted an abortion?

701
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:33,125
- She didn't want an abortion!
<i>- Don't.</i>

702
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,428
- She told you that?
- No, I haven't spoken to her in years.

703
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:37,029
- I'm just asking.
- Is this you?

704
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,165
- No.
<i>- Do the people who care so deeply</i>

705
00:32:39,199 --> 00:32:43,235
about the life of a microscopic
piece of biology

706
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,139
with no ability to experience physical
or emotional suffering

707
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:48,942
care at all about a two-year-old
who was born to a mother

708
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:52,512
who didn't want the child
and was unable to care for her?

709
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:54,447
Help her out of this.

710
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:56,316
Lisa, I just want to be
clear for the viewers

711
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:58,351
that you're not saying
Casey's only two options

712
00:32:58,385 --> 00:33:00,854
were abortion
or murdering a toddler.

713
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:06,793
I'm saying that
there's an undiscussed

714
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,795
and unappreciated cruelty

715
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,930
in forcing a child
to be born to a mother

716
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,565
who doesn't want the child

717
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:15,600
and isn't capable
of raising the child.

718
00:33:15,635 --> 00:33:20,105
Okay, let's get back to what
Casey was like in high school.

719
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:23,041
Where's a power outage
when you really need one?

720
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:40,792
What's wrong?

721
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,112
- You all right?
- Yeah.

722
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,948
- How'd they know where you were?
- Her Facebook page.

723
00:34:02,983 --> 00:34:05,217
- Shut the page down.
- I'll take care of it.

724
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,623
Hey.

725
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:12,691
- Is she all right?
- Where's Lonny?

726
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:14,627
You shouldn't be out alone.

727
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,929
- You all right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

728
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:18,898
Are you mad I didn't tell you
I was gonna do that?

729
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,799
No.

730
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,301
I know you're pro-life.

731
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:24,202
I'm not pro throwing
a brick through a window.

732
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:26,204
There are gonna be local
news trucks here any second.

733
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,139
- Get her out of here.
- You, too.

734
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:30,608
Is that your boss?
The owner of the shop?

735
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:34,446
I'm gonna talk to her.

736
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,715
This should have been me
and not you.

737
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,323
Come on.
Let's go.

738
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:53,531
<i>Teddy, is there something
different about these pants?</i>

739
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,166
Different from what?

740
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:57,035
Every time I wear that suit,
I mean every time,

741
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:59,070
I put both my legs
into one side of the pants.

742
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:00,505
One side of the pants?

743
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,774
I stand up, I put one leg into one side,

744
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:04,743
and then I take my other leg
and I'm certainly aiming

745
00:35:04,777 --> 00:35:06,644
for the other side of the pants,
but I get stuck.

746
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,212
And I'm asking
if there's something,

747
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,181
not so much wrong,
but different about those pants.

748
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:11,916
You can't put your pants on
and you think

749
00:35:11,951 --> 00:35:13,451
there's something wrong
with the pants?

750
00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,319
All right, get out.

751
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:18,223
- Adam Roth is here.
- Yes.

752
00:35:18,257 --> 00:35:20,758
- Adam!
- Rock star.

753
00:35:20,792 --> 00:35:23,294
- How you doing, man?
- I'm good.

754
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:25,329
- How's Emily?
- The whole family's great.

755
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:28,500
David got into Stanford,
so thanks for the recommendation.

756
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:31,270
I wrote him a pretty bad recommendation.
I'm surprised they took him.

757
00:35:31,304 --> 00:35:33,005
They must not care that much
about what you think.

758
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,574
This is my partner at the RNC,

759
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,676
- Tate Brady.
- Nice to meet you.

760
00:35:37,711 --> 00:35:39,145
- How do you do?
- Excellent.

761
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,314
Charlie Skinner, Mackenzie McHale,
this is Adam Roth.

762
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,150
Will talks about you like you were
bunkmates at summer camp.

763
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:47,353
Well, we were,
but the summer camp was the White House

764
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,622
and there was no bunk
or sleep of any kind.

765
00:35:49,656 --> 00:35:51,958
I was Bush 41's body man
right out of college

766
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:55,862
and Will was writing greeting cards
or something in the communications office.

767
00:35:55,897 --> 00:35:57,731
I wrote serious policy speeches.

768
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:59,465
For the Muncie Chamber of Commerce.

769
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,834
They were good speeches.

770
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,569
And the president adopted Will

771
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:05,571
as the fourth son he never had.

772
00:36:05,606 --> 00:36:07,974
The president knew my name
and that's thanks to Adam.

773
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:10,143
I'm sorry.
This is his partner Greg Brady.

774
00:36:10,177 --> 00:36:12,011
- Tate.
- I'm sorry, Tate.

775
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:15,582
Everybody sit down.
Anybody need coffee or anything?

776
00:36:15,616 --> 00:36:17,183
- I'm okay.
- I'm good.

777
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:19,552
So we're glad to see your numbers
rebounded from last week.

778
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:24,156
We hadn't been covering Casey Anthony
and half our audience went to HLN.

779
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,125
But we started covering it
and things stabilized.

780
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,528
Well, good, because we were about
ready to offer a debate to Nancy Grace.

781
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,765
So the rules of the debate
are pretty simple.

782
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,568
There is some room for you to make
a few choices, but not much.

783
00:36:36,603 --> 00:36:38,837
Everybody gets an opening statement.

784
00:36:38,872 --> 00:36:41,707
Everybody gets at least two questions
with 60 seconds to answer

785
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,309
and it's up to you whether you want to
offer someone a rebuttal.

786
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:46,878
We had something different in mind.

787
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,313
What'd you have in mind?

788
00:36:48,348 --> 00:36:50,649
Adam, how many hours
did you and I spend

789
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:52,417
talking about how flawed
the debates were?

790
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,452
Especially the primary debates?

791
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:55,954
A lot of hours.

792
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:59,291
Well, now you and I are in a position
to do something about that.

793
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:02,394
Follow me.

794
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,463
The questions have to be tougher.

795
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:07,499
They have to be able to square
their campaign rhetoric with facts.

796
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:09,802
They have to be stopped when
they're not answering the question.

797
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,338
And they have to be called out
when their answers contradict the facts.

798
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:14,040
Guys, get in place.

799
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:15,775
Our job is to find the two candidates

800
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,710
who'll give the voters
the best competing arguments,

801
00:37:17,744 --> 00:37:19,245
and I don't believe we're seeing that.

802
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,947
We have to put the candidates
on a witness stand.

803
00:37:20,981 --> 00:37:23,283
- Would you have them swear an oath?
- Just let 'em do it.

804
00:37:23,317 --> 00:37:25,585
If baseball players testifying about steroids

805
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,088
in front of a House Subcommittee
are subject to perjury,

806
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:30,057
I don't know why presidential
candidates aren't.

807
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:33,961
But I'm not reaching for the stars,
I'm reaching just an inch higher.

808
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:37,231
Welcome to Princeton University
in Princeton, New Jersey,

809
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:41,636
for the fifth debate in the
2012 Republican primary race,

810
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:45,808
cosponsored by Atlantis Cable News
and the Republican Party of New Jersey.

811
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:48,977
At which point we'll explain the rules,
which is there are no rules.

812
00:37:49,012 --> 00:37:50,713
I question a candidate until I'm done.

813
00:37:50,747 --> 00:37:52,415
They can each make
an opening statement.

814
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,217
Beginning with you,
Congresswoman Bachmann.

815
00:37:55,252 --> 00:37:57,052
Hi, my name is Michele Bachmann.

816
00:37:57,087 --> 00:37:59,588
I'm a former federal tax
litigation attorney,

817
00:37:59,623 --> 00:38:01,924
the owner of a successful company,
and also a member--

818
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:05,227
Hang on. Is that supposed to be a
Michele Bachmann impersonation?

819
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:08,097
No, nobody's doing impressions.
This isn't an <i>SNL</i> sketch.

820
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:10,766
<i>These people have spent two months
studying stump speeches,</i>

821
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:14,036
interviews, on-the-record statements,
previous debate performances

822
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,971
in order to come as close
as possible to answering

823
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,040
our questions the way
the candidates would.

824
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:20,977
After the opening statements,
we'd move to questioning.

825
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,847
Senator Santorum,
you said that your campaign

826
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,349
is about freedom
and that 20 years from now

827
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,151
you don't want to be
telling your grandchildren

828
00:38:28,185 --> 00:38:30,053
how America once was free.

829
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:32,255
Name three freedoms
you had the day before

830
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,957
President Obama was sworn in
that you don't have now.

831
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:36,459
Obamacare, to begin with.

832
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:37,993
Obamacare is the most egregious--

833
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:39,762
<i>Have you had to
change doctors?</i>

834
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,297
- May I finish?
- No, sir.

835
00:38:41,332 --> 00:38:43,767
- <i>Have you had to change doctors?</i> 
<i>- No.</i>

836
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:46,302
Has anyone in your family
had to change doctors?

837
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:48,939
Has there been any change at all
in health care for you or your family?

838
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:50,840
<i>I'm talking about
Obamacare now.</i>

839
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,243
My question was name
three freedoms that you had

840
00:38:53,277 --> 00:38:56,179
the day before the president was sworn in
that you don't have now.

841
00:38:56,214 --> 00:38:58,348
Mr. Speaker, you just said
that if you're elected,

842
00:38:58,382 --> 00:39:01,118
the price of gas will be $2.50 a gallon.

843
00:39:01,152 --> 00:39:03,887
How does the US President
control the price of oil?

844
00:39:03,921 --> 00:39:07,891
Governor, you've said that as president
you will never apologize for America.

845
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,393
This question is in two parts.

846
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:11,329
<i>Name an instance
in which the president</i>

847
00:39:11,363 --> 00:39:13,064
<i>has apologized for America</i>

848
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:15,234
<i>and can you imagine no instance</i>

849
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:18,037
in which a US president
should apologize for America?

850
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,506
Mr. McAvoy, I find it reprehensible

851
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:23,343
that the liberal media would try to pit
Republicans against one another.

852
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:25,512
And I, for one,
won't stand by while it happens.

853
00:39:25,547 --> 00:39:27,414
This is the Republican primary,
Mr. Speaker,

854
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:28,982
and you're running for the nomination.

855
00:39:29,017 --> 00:39:31,384
It wasn't my idea to pit you against anyone.
It was yours.

856
00:39:31,419 --> 00:39:34,121
Congressman Paul,
I'd like to discuss the newsletters

857
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:36,289
<i>you wrote and sold
starting in the 1990s.</i>

858
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:38,525
<i>I've already said
everything I have to say.</i>

859
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,694
I never wrote those letters
and I never even read them.

860
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,796
They had your name on them.
They had your signature on them.

861
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,732
<i>You made money from them.
And in 1996 you defended them</i>

862
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,334
<i>to the </i>Dallas Morning News<i>.</i>

863
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:51,138
- I don't like pretending--
- Stop. Everybody stop.

864
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,540
<i>There's no need to go
along any further.</i>

865
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:56,376
I see where you're going.

866
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:57,878
- Adam.
<i>- Listen--</i>

867
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:00,280
Is there someplace we can talk privately?

868
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,948
Take my office.

869
00:40:03,118 --> 00:40:04,752
Adam.

870
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,732
I think they really liked it.

871
00:40:22,736 --> 00:40:25,137
You did a good job, everybody.
Give me a minute.

872
00:40:32,145 --> 00:40:35,480
- I told you, this guy--
- This guy what?

873
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:37,616
Wasn't on the team.

874
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,685
- He's on the team, okay?
- Hang on.

875
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,420
The team I'm on is the voters'

876
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:44,090
<i>and smart, qualified people
disagreeing about issues.</i>

877
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:46,425
<i>Your plan was to embarrass
the candidates.</i>

878
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,294
I want candidates who can
answer those questions.

879
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:50,929
And if they know they're going to be
held responsible for the nonsense

880
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:53,432
they're shouting on the stump,
they'll be forced to stop shouting nonsense.

881
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:55,434
- This guy has lost his mind.
- He hasn't.

882
00:40:55,468 --> 00:40:57,936
Adam, this is exactly what
we always talked about.

883
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,404
<i>This is what we dreamed of.</i>

884
00:40:59,438 --> 00:41:01,239
<i>We said we need
real campaign reform</i>

885
00:41:01,273 --> 00:41:04,142
and a way of letting Americans hear
the two best competing arguments.

886
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:06,344
Nobody could stand up
to that kind of questioning.

887
00:41:06,378 --> 00:41:09,047
- You think that was brutal questioning?
- It really wasn't.

888
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:12,651
And you honestly believe the candidates
would submit themselves to this?

889
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,853
- They should welcome it.
- I don't believe what I'm hearing.

890
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:16,388
Any candidate who can handle a cross

891
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:19,191
is gonna find himself at the top of the polls
in the morning.

892
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:22,128
And we should welcome
it 'cause it'll clear out the clown car

893
00:41:22,162 --> 00:41:24,897
and give us a serious discussion
among serious candidates.

894
00:41:24,931 --> 00:41:26,465
The only person who would
welcome it is him.

895
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,467
This is about him.
He wants to look tough

896
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:30,402
by making the candidates
look like idiots.

897
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:33,705
No, he doesn't. I have known this man
for 25 years and I vouch--

898
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,441
I don't care what you vouch for.

899
00:41:35,475 --> 00:41:39,878
I am not allowing the goddamn press
to make fools out of our candidates.

900
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:44,282
I'll remember that the next time you bitch
about how the press never vetted Obama.

901
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:49,054
We're not agreeing to this format.

902
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:52,323
You are going to abide
by the rules that we give you

903
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:55,560
and I don't want Mackenzie McHale
producing it for you.

904
00:41:57,362 --> 00:41:58,863
What are you talking about?

905
00:41:58,897 --> 00:42:00,865
I want the old Will McAvoy.

906
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,667
Not the thing she turned you into.

907
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:04,836
I know all about that lady.

908
00:42:22,288 --> 00:42:25,290
- Get out.
- Will, come on. You need the debate.

909
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:26,725
Of course he can use Mackenzie.

910
00:42:26,759 --> 00:42:29,494
These guys have been compromising
and compromising all week

911
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:32,330
so we could host a debate that made
some sense and did some good.

912
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:34,766
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
because it was all for nothing.

913
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:36,502
- <i>We need ACN.</i>
- No, we don't.

914
00:42:36,536 --> 00:42:37,970
<i>They've got the independents.</i>

915
00:42:38,004 --> 00:42:39,838
He's not the only anchor at ACN.

916
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:43,609
- Don Keefer.
- Yeah?

917
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:46,945
How would you and Elliot Hirsch like
to have one of the debates?

918
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,081
Eat me.

919
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:53,585
- Mr. Skinner, I'm trying to be as--
- When Don says, "Eat me,"

920
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:56,054
that's usually the end of the conversation.

921
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,056
Sloan Sabbith.

922
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:00,792
- You want to be a star?
- Me?

923
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:02,794
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Fuck you.

924
00:43:07,834 --> 00:43:09,768
I hate these guys.

925
00:43:09,802 --> 00:43:11,870
I don't know why you don't.

926
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:13,771
And I'll be in the car.

927
00:43:26,551 --> 00:43:28,452
I'm really sorry.

928
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:32,890
I can't be out of work.

929
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:35,826
- Tuition at Stanford is--
- No, I know.

930
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,729
It was good seeing you.

931
00:43:38,763 --> 00:43:41,131
You, too.

932
00:43:41,166 --> 00:43:43,934
All those things
we talked about...

933
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,770
Yeah.

934
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:49,173
Don't let 'em push you around.

935
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,680
You take it easy.

936
00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:15,301
I'm sorry, everyone.

937
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:17,637
We lost the debate.

938
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:26,013
I'm sorry.

939
00:44:36,123 --> 00:44:38,724
We've got about an hour to air.
Let's put it together.

940
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:47,065
He'll cave.
He'll agree to the debate on their terms.

941
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,067
- No, he won't.
- You romanticize Will.

942
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:51,236
- Mm-hmm.
- That mock debate was about him.

943
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,305
He was the star.
He attacked his--

944
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:55,006
He didn't attack anybody.

945
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,276
He asked questions that the candidates
should be able to answer

946
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,445
and that the voters should
be able to hear them answer.

947
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,748
He didn't cower
and he wasn't Ed McMahon.

948
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,350
Thinking there was
even a remote chance--

949
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:05,952
- Maybe it was naive.
- It wasn't naive, it was hubris.

950
00:45:05,986 --> 00:45:07,453
It was gutsy
and you're just jealous.

951
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:10,490
Jealous of what?
You know, fuck you, Mac.

952
00:45:10,524 --> 00:45:12,926
I've spent this week
letting you kick my ass

953
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,194
from here to the Chrysler Building
because you were selling out

954
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:17,697
every 15 minutes to get your hands on
something you didn't get.

955
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,866
And you were embarrassed
by it in front of me.

956
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,601
He doesn't want you.

957
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,169
Please don't talk
about my personal life.

958
00:45:23,203 --> 00:45:24,704
I'm sort of a key player in it.

959
00:45:24,738 --> 00:45:26,906
Is it all right if I talk
about my personal life?

960
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,041
Yes, I broke up with you.
I'm the first guy ever

961
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:31,010
to break up with a woman.
And then I came back.

962
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:33,079
Also unprecedented.
Did he come back?

963
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:34,881
I don't know yet.

964
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:36,649
Seriously?
After four years?

965
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:40,219
In <i>Castaway</i>, Helen Hunt got remarried
in less time than--

966
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,957
I never would have gone
with the Casey Anthony story.

967
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,626
I don't care how much
of my audience I was losing.

968
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,227
And he's gonna cave
on the debate, too.

969
00:45:47,261 --> 00:45:50,230
- Are you sure about that?
- I am absolutely sure about that.

970
00:45:50,264 --> 00:45:52,299
You know what I like about Will?

971
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,103
He's not absolutely sure about anything.

972
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,704
He struggles with things.

973
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:00,207
He's never certain he's right
and sometimes he's not.

974
00:46:00,241 --> 00:46:02,109
But he tries hard to be.

975
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:04,244
He struggles with things.

976
00:46:04,278 --> 00:46:06,813
God!

977
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:09,182
Will, are you all right?

978
00:46:09,217 --> 00:46:11,184
Could somebody help Will
put his pants on?

979
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:17,090
I don't think this is gonna work out.

980
00:46:17,124 --> 00:46:19,225
- The story?
- Yeah.

981
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:20,893
That's Will's call.

982
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:23,930
Excuse me.

983
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:25,465
How's it going there?

984
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,067
There's something off
with these pants.

985
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:29,902
I think maybe considering everything
that's gone on here

986
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,971
this week, you should reconsider
having Brian write the piece.

987
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:34,073
- Can you handle him being here?
- I can handle him being here.

988
00:46:34,108 --> 00:46:35,775
- But I think--
- I brought him in here to punish you.

989
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:38,111
- I know.
- I think I may have also brought him in here

990
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:40,747
- so you could see a side-by-side comparison.
- You're an idiot.

991
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:43,416
- Hey, these are really hard pants.
- Not the pants.

992
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,985
I have cooperated with
and been the engine behind

993
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:49,289
an instant dismantling of everything
we've built and everything we stand for.

994
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:52,659
I've ignored serious stories
so we can get down in the gutter

995
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:55,328
with the Casey Anthony circus
and the Anthony Weiner distraction.

996
00:46:55,363 --> 00:46:57,964
And I've done it all
while Brian's been standing

997
00:46:57,998 --> 00:46:59,900
over my shoulder
because you put him there.

998
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,935
And you pass on the debate
because that guy insulted me?

999
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:04,537
Who are you?!

1000
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:08,375
I don't know where your head is at
at any given moment!

1001
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,211
I am this close to losing it!
I think I have!

1002
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:13,146
I think it's happening right now!

1003
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,582
- Settle down.
- I will not settle down!

1004
00:47:15,617 --> 00:47:18,552
I should, though. I should settle down.

1005
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,955
Remember your first day here,
the BP spill?

1006
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:22,523
Yeah.

1007
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:24,626
Remember when I said
throw out the rundown?

1008
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,528
- Yeah.
- Did you think that was cool?

1009
00:47:27,562 --> 00:47:28,896
Yeah.

1010
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,398
Throw out the rundown.

1011
00:47:31,466 --> 00:47:32,966
Wait, no.

1012
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:35,535
We still need the numbers.
We've got to protect you from Leona.

1013
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:38,405
Yeah, I can't live with a 15-year-old girl
being the toughest guy at my desk.

1014
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,040
- Are you talking about Lisa?
- Yeah.

1015
00:47:40,074 --> 00:47:42,175
- She's 26.
- They all look 15 to me. Sloan.

1016
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:43,876
- Are you sure about this?
- Not at all.

1017
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:45,611
- Yeah?
- If I ask you the right questions,

1018
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:48,747
can you talk about the debt ceiling
for two segments tonight?

1019
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,484
- I don't even need the questions.
- Get ready.

1020
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,319
Can you handle Brian being here
a little while longer?

1021
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,787
I can handle anything.

1022
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,289
- Jellyfish.
- I don't like jellyfish.

1023
00:47:57,324 --> 00:47:58,791
- Brian.
- Yeah?

1024
00:47:58,825 --> 00:48:01,627
Just write the truth, okay?
Just write the truth.

1025
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,168
We're throwing out the rundown
and leading with the debt ceiling.

1026
00:48:11,538 --> 00:48:14,374
- You get all that?
- Yeah.

1027
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,610
Is it working?

1028
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:19,779
No.
They're laughing at me.

1029
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,581
They think
I'm a small-time troll.

1030
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:23,816
- That's got to hurt.
- It does.

1031
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:26,787
It's too bad you're not the guy
who left the death threat for Will.

1032
00:48:31,593 --> 00:48:33,294
That's a dangerous area.

1033
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:35,897
Yeah.

1034
00:49:10,299 --> 00:49:11,733
Jim?

1035
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,636
Yeah?

1036
00:49:15,771 --> 00:49:17,705
Whatever happened with you and Lisa?

1037
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:22,777
Uh, she doesn't want to go out with me.

1038
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:25,780
I gave it a try.

1039
00:49:25,814 --> 00:49:27,481
A try?

1040
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:29,983
Yeah.

1041
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:34,188
"Gather ye rosebuds."
You know what that means?

1042
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:38,992
It's the first half of the first line
of a poem by Robert Herrick.

1043
00:49:39,027 --> 00:49:40,761
What's the second half?

1044
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,464
"While ye may."

1045
00:49:45,934 --> 00:49:49,103
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

1046
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,011
I'm gonna.

1047
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:06,453
"Then be not coy but use your time,
and while ye may go marry.

1048
00:50:06,488 --> 00:50:10,224
For having lost but once your prime,
you may forever tarry."

1049
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:14,195
- I won't.
- Okay.

1050
00:50:16,365 --> 00:50:18,632
- First we have to do the show.
- Yeah.

1051
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,446
<i>You're 100% sure?</i>

1052
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,815
<i>It was a year ago.
It was over a year ago.</i>

1053
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:35,917
He was the new guy in the office

1054
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:38,286
and Don and I were in a terrible place.

1055
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,589
So I had a stupid crush on him
for five minutes.

1056
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,658
He was nice to me
even though I was mean to him,

1057
00:50:43,692 --> 00:50:45,893
so I thought maybe
he liked me, too.

1058
00:50:45,927 --> 00:50:47,761
But that's just over,

1059
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,930
and he's really trying hard with you.

1060
00:50:49,965 --> 00:50:51,899
- So if you like him...
- Of course I like him.

1061
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:53,567
There's no way to fix
the air conditioning.

1062
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,203
Your choices are
90 degrees or 30 degrees.

1063
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:57,705
Who's here at midnight?

1064
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,045
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Jim.</i>

1065
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,781
<i>Come on up.</i>

1066
00:51:08,517 --> 00:51:10,451
We never got to the God question.

1067
00:51:10,486 --> 00:51:13,922
Bachmann said that God told her to run
and Maggie wanted Will to ask her

1068
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:16,591
what God's voice sounded like.
I think it would have sealed it for us.

1069
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:19,160
If every network said,
"We're not playing by your rules.

1070
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:21,996
You're playing by ours,"
we'd raise the level of debate overnight.

1071
00:51:22,031 --> 00:51:23,465
It wasn't as crazy as it sounded.

1072
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:25,200
It was exactly as crazy as it sounded.

1073
00:51:25,234 --> 00:51:27,035
Good luck.

1074
00:51:30,273 --> 00:51:32,274
- Hi.
- Hi.

1075
00:51:32,308 --> 00:51:33,942
- I wanted to talk to--
- Hey, man.

1076
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:35,744
Hey, Don.

1077
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:40,682
- I did-- I didn't know that you'd--
- Maggie talked me into it.

1078
00:51:40,716 --> 00:51:42,317
I'm sorry?

1079
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,152
You don't have to pitch me.

1080
00:51:44,186 --> 00:51:46,421
Maggie talked me into it.

1081
00:51:58,067 --> 00:52:00,034
- Let's go for a walk.
- Listen--

1082
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:01,502
Let's go.

1083
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:09,678
Nice ending, don't you think?

1084
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:12,314
He had a whole speech
he didn't get to use.

1085
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:17,986
Don?

1086
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:19,788
Hmm?

1087
00:52:21,023 --> 00:52:22,624
What is it?

1088
00:52:24,693 --> 00:52:26,494
He said,
"I wanted to talk to--"

1089
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:28,362
and then I cut him off.

1090
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,131
What are you--

1091
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:33,367
Lisa wasn't the one
he came here to see.

1092
00:52:35,604 --> 00:52:37,505
I don't--

1093
00:52:37,539 --> 00:52:39,841
He signed for the flowers.

1094
00:52:41,176 --> 00:52:42,343
What?

1095
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:44,979
I have to explain something.

1096
00:52:56,892 --> 00:52:59,026
<i>Congresswoman Bachmann, to you.</i>

1097
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:00,528
Elvis or Johnny Cash?

1098
00:53:00,562 --> 00:53:02,663
Oh, that's really tough.

1099
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:05,099
That's really-- Both.
Both.

1100
00:53:05,134 --> 00:53:08,503
- <i>Both?</i> 
<i>- Yeah, I've got "Christmas With Elvis" on my iPod.</i>

1101
00:53:10,573 --> 00:53:13,242
<i>All right, now we know what's
on the congresswoman's iPod.</i>

1102
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:18,006
This is Lonny.

1103
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,441
- <i>Lonny, it's Neal.</i>
- Yeah?

1104
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:21,243
<i>I'm sorry to call you so late,
but I need to tell you</i>

1105
00:54:21,277 --> 00:54:23,144
<i>about something that's
on my computer right now.</i>

1106
00:54:23,179 --> 00:54:26,214
<i>I've been working on this story,
and without going into too many details...</i>

1107
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:59,883
