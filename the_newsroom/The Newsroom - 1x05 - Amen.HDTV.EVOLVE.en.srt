1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:02,724
You can't have your boyfriends
lobbying me to go easier on them.

2
00:00:02,747 --> 00:00:06,904
Hang on. He was pitching a story.
And it's not boyfriends. It's one boyfriend.

3
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:09,804
I should have fixed you up
with Jim a long time ago.

4
00:00:09,822 --> 00:00:12,838
I've never been on a date with him,
but I imagine...

5
00:00:12,862 --> 00:00:15,728
- You imagine what and how often?
- That it would be fun.

6
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:18,028
- I'm Nina Howard.
- Hi. I'm so sorry.

7
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:21,196
- Can I talk to you a moment?
- She wants to warn you that I'm a gossip columnist.

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,033
- "Will McAvoy gropes in the New Year."
- What?

9
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,801
- I called you in for this.
- When's it come out?

10
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:28,203
It's out. This is it.
"Serial Sleaze."

11
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:30,771
We're not here talking about ratings,
are we?

12
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,372
We lost David and Charles.
Do not come down on the Kochs

13
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:34,941
without checking upstairs.

14
00:00:34,975 --> 00:00:36,375
There's been
a shooting in Tucson.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,678
MSNBC, FOX,
and CNN all say she's dead.

16
00:00:38,713 --> 00:00:40,881
A doctor pronounces her dead,
not the news.

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,382
- She's alive.
- I've got her alive.

18
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,950
NPR called it wrong.
She's alive.

19
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:46,053
You tell Leona that if
she wants me out of this chair,

20
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,053
she better bring more
than just a couple of guys.

21
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:50,201
That's exactly what
I'll fucking tell her.

22
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:22,783

<i>Systematically we have seen

26
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:38,317
We would like
to be showing you--

27
00:02:38,352 --> 00:02:40,186
instead of this strange
image of me sitting on

28
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:43,223
the floor of an undisclosed
location in dim lighting,

29
00:02:43,257 --> 00:02:45,258
we would like to be
showing you pictures--

30
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:49,079
<i>Live pictures of what's happening
in Tahrir Square right now,</i>

31
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:52,199
but we can't do that because
our cameras have been taken down.

32
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:55,869
Physically, Elliot, when you say
your cameras have been taken down?

33
00:02:55,904 --> 00:02:58,105
Through threats
and intimidation

34
00:02:58,139 --> 00:02:59,973
and through
actual physical attacks.

35
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:03,009
We're looking at Al Jazeera feed
from about six hours ago.

36
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:04,344
Can you describe
what we're seeing?

37
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:06,613
He can't describe anything
except his room.

38
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:08,147
Ask him what's in the minibar.

39
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,982
I'd like it
if you'd settle down.

40
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,918
Then I think you're
gonna be disappointed.

41
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:14,720
That was roughly
7:00 P.M. in Cairo.

42
00:03:14,754 --> 00:03:16,322
Elliot?

43
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:19,058
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Will.
- Elliot, can you--

44
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:21,094
There's gunfire coming
from below our hotel room.

45
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:22,795
- Where's he going?
- Out on the balcony.

46
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,097
- Get back on the air.
- Do we still have Elliot?

47
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,365
- Take it.
- God damn it!

48
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,835
If you're just joining us with dawn
about to break in Cairo,

49
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,071
a crowd estimated at over
100,000 people

50
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:34,142
gathered several hours ago in Tahrir Square
in the Egyptian capital...

51
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:36,045
Get back on the fucking air.

52
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,482
Mubarak resign after 18 days

53
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,785
of unprecedented
pro-democracy protests.

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,688
How long's he gonna
be on the balcony?

55
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,326
The resignation was expected
by President Obama,

56
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,928
French President
Nicolas Sarkozy,

57
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:50,131
and British Prime Minister
David Cameron.

58
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:52,099
But in a 17-minute address,

59
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:54,736
Mubarak announced that he
wouldn't be stepping down,

60
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,141
infuriating the crowd,
which appears to have grown larger

61
00:03:58,176 --> 00:04:01,277
and angrier throughout
this extraordinary night.

62
00:04:01,312 --> 00:04:03,713
We're speaking with our
own Elliot Hirsch...

63
00:04:03,748 --> 00:04:07,117
No, Elliot's on the balcony
singing a song from <i>Evita</i>.

64
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:08,585
- An undisclosed location.
- He's back.

65
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,954
- <i>Pardon me, Will.</i>
- Yeah, is everything all right?

66
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:13,357
Uh, that was gunfire.

67
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,492
It doesn't appear
that anyone's been injured,

68
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,295
<i>but it is a little hard
to tell from where I am.</i>

69
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,698
We're looking at a feed
from six hours ago, Elliot.

70
00:04:19,732 --> 00:04:21,966
Can you describe what's happening
in the Square right now?

71
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,137
Uh, the crowd is surging
and spreading.

72
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,706
<i>The army has made a ring
around Tahrir Square...</i>

73
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:30,176
- Ow!
- Oh, God, are you all right?

74
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,678
It's a glass door.
You can't see me standing here?

75
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,113
Yeah, be quiet.
There's a new story.

76
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,683
We're getting footage
of a protest that's forming

77
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:39,619
in Appleton, Wisconsin.
The governor's inside a newspaper office there

78
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:42,889
and a spontaneous protest of teachers
is happening outside the building right now.

79
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,535
- Yup, go.
- Call the edit bay and tell them what's happening.

80
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,604
Will, we're going to push
the commercial break.

81
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,274
A small protest broke out
in front of a newspaper office

82
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:00,377
where Scott Walker
is right now.

83
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:03,981
So we're cutting the feed.
Tap your pen if you understand.

84
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:06,550
And now the protests
are spreading out from Tahrir?

85
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,455
- I'm already on it.
- Which one?

86
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:12,090
- The teachers in Wisconsin.
- That's me.

87
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:14,192
- What's going on?
- The governor of Wisconsin

88
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:16,928
is pushing a bill through the legislature
to balance the state budget

89
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:19,433
by busting public sector unions,
especially teachers,

90
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:21,101
and strip their collective
bargaining rights.

91
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:23,170
<i>The governor is trapped
in a newspaper office</i>

92
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:26,574
with 75 teachers protesting outside
and by tomorrow it'll be 10,000.

93
00:05:26,608 --> 00:05:29,144
Yes, but in the meantime,
some Egyptians are about to overthrow Egypt.

94
00:05:29,178 --> 00:05:30,912
- <i>Is there anyone else here?</i>
- Nope.

95
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:34,015
Okay. We got two packages to cut
and only one editor.

96
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:36,017
Cory, if I promise
I understand the irony,

97
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,053
can I break union rules
and sit at this bay?

98
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,155
Will you talk to someone
about hiring more editors?

99
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,957
Talk is all I can promise.
But I'm on your side.

100
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,392
Go ahead.
Where do you want to start?

101
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,995
It's around 12:20. He starts the answer with
"We have in state government."

102
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,332
- We have in state government--
- Right there.

103
00:05:51,366 --> 00:05:53,868
Before I'd taken office,
plans for contingencies

104
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:56,837
no matter what the circumstances.
We have updated those.

105
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,774
<i>I've had a full briefing
from all the major level one</i>

106
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:02,209
state agencies as well as
the National Guard yesterday.

107
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,311
- Cut it there.
- Cut it there.

108
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:04,479
Pay attention to your thing.

109
00:06:04,513 --> 00:06:07,716
<i>Right there where
the teachers are chanting.</i>

110
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,453
Hey hey, ho ho,
selfish Scott has got to go.

111
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,588
Cut it there.
That's the package. Render it.

112
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,526
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,628
I'm about to have
my "Broadcast News" moment.

114
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,996
There are at least nine things between here
and the control room I can trip over.

115
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,332
It's 2011.
We don't move film manually anymore.

116
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:25,967
You're gonna have
to move this manually.

117
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:27,869
It's taking too long to render
both at the same time.

118
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:28,937
- Grab a thumb drive,
- Can I use a thumb drive,

119
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,605
- throw it in the USB,
- Put it in the USB,

120
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,240
- copy the raw file to the drive,
- Copy the raw file, and I'll

121
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,875
- and run to the control room.
- Take it down to control?

122
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:36,210
I'm right behind you.

123
00:06:36,244 --> 00:06:38,879
So as we mentioned,
there are thousands currently outside

124
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:42,350
of state TV and parliament
and a call for 25...

125
00:06:42,384 --> 00:06:44,685
There's a group of protesters
headed towards Heliopolis.

126
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,288
Ask him if he knows
anything about the protesters

127
00:06:47,322 --> 00:06:49,423
<i>heading towards
the presidential palace.</i>

128
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:51,358
We're getting information
about protesters

129
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:53,259
heading towards the presidential palace
in Heliopolis.

130
00:06:53,294 --> 00:06:55,495
I don't know
anything about that.

131
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,997
'Cause you're in
the Cairo Radisson.

132
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:58,365
Does he look happy about that?

133
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,767
It's hard for me to tell

134
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:01,269
from the incredibly high-resolution pictures
we're getting.

135
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,937
I'm as frustrated as you are,
Don,

136
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:05,273
but I'm not sending an American journalist
into that protest.

137
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:07,176
- <i>Trust me, I'm an American journalist.</i>
- Hey!

138
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,845
That's the Walker press conference and
the teachers in Appleton unrendered.

139
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,649
- Got it.
- I didn't trip over anything on the way.

140
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,951
- Oh!
- Sorry!

141
00:07:14,985 --> 00:07:17,253
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

142
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:19,723
- Sorry.
- Raw file?

143
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:21,858
Let's pivot now.

144
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,894
All right,
Elliot Hirsch reporting from Cairo.

145
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:27,097
- We'll be coming back to you, Elliot.
- Why?

146
00:07:27,131 --> 00:07:29,465
Where are you going?

147
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,234
I'm gonna find someone
who's on the ground.

148
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,869
<i>What is shocking is to hear
an American governor</i>

149
00:07:33,904 --> 00:07:35,738
<i>threaten to call up
the National Guard.</i>

150
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:37,573
But that's just
what Scott Walker,

151
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,509
the commander in chief of the
Wisconsin National Guard, did today

152
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,078
in defending his Wisconsin
budget repair bill.

153
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,748
Anyone with producer in their title,
conference room.

154
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,883
- Sloan.
- I'm not a producer.

155
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,319
- <i>I need you. Can you wait a minute?</i>
- I was this close.

156
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:52,455
You know I'd have had
security stop you downstairs.

157
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:53,990
- I know.
- I'll be just a couple of minutes.

158
00:07:54,024 --> 00:07:56,225
Okay, but sometimes
you ask me to wait

159
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,462
and then you forget that you did and
you call me from home at 11:00 and say sorry.

160
00:07:59,496 --> 00:08:01,330
- How many times has that happened?
- Twice.

161
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:03,633
Well, I really was sorry.

162
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:05,301
I'll sit and watch TV.

163
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:06,936
Does anyone know
where there's a TV?

164
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,638
Honey, I'm sorry.
I need 20 minutes.

165
00:08:08,672 --> 00:08:11,040
No, I can see.
Is Egypt still a country?

166
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,441
Yeah, it's just a new one.

167
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:15,244
I happen to be an Egyptologist
if you want me on tomorrow.

168
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:16,678
Since when are you
an Egyptologist?

169
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,180
I can be one by tomorrow.

170
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:20,482
Go to Hang Chew's, get a drink,
and I'll meet you there.

171
00:08:20,516 --> 00:08:21,783
Yes, boss.

172
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:25,254
- <i>Herb.</i>
- Yes, ma'am?

173
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,823
We were 17 seconds heavy on Bernanke,
which meant we had to squeeze--

174
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,294
- Wait, wait. Everybody watch this.
- There's nothing to watch.

175
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:33,396
- She has to subtract with her fingers.
- I don't have to.

176
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,564
We were 17 seconds
heavy on Bernanke,

177
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,067
which means we had
to squeeze Bill Kristol down to what?

178
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,806
2:13.

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,043
And Will took tap dancing lessons
when he was 11.

180
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:49,211
And Mackenzie thought <i>This Old House</i>

181
00:08:49,246 --> 00:08:50,613
was working on the same
house every week.

182
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,981
Everyone in the conference room.
And that was reasonable.

183
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,984
It took six months
to build the city of Dubai.

184
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:58,087
You think they were renovating the same
mid-century colonial for 15 years?

185
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,589
- Let's go.
- How many kitchens do you think that house had?

186
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,858
That'll do.
Let's get serious.

187
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:06,295
I'll begin by saying that Will cries
when he watches the movie <i>Rudy</i>.

188
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,431
- No, I don't.
- Cries like an onion.

189
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,601
Onions make you cry.
They don't themselves experience emotion.

190
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:13,603
The way you experience emotion
when you watch <i>Rudy</i>.

191
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,606
One scene, one moment,
once in a while.

192
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,074
- The jersey scene?
- Yes.

193
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,208
Everybody cries
at the jersey scene.

194
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:20,143
- Jim?
- I never saw it.

195
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,645
- You haven't seen <i>Rudy</i>?
- Uh-oh.

196
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,014
What were you doing when everyone else
your age was living their lives?

197
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:26,550
- My homework.
- "My homework."

198
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,020
I didn't think I'd be
the only one to say that.

199
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,722
I thought I'd have
the safety of a mob.

200
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:34,558
Listen up, 'cause it's Rudy's last chance
to dress for a game.

201
00:09:34,593 --> 00:09:36,627
- I shouldn't have started this.
- Well, you did.

202
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:38,728
NCAA rules only allow a certain number
of players to be in uniform.

203
00:09:38,763 --> 00:09:41,198
And every time the list goes up,
Rudy's name is left off it.

204
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,735
And the list for the last game goes up
and Rudy's name is left off it again.

205
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,605
Four years of futility. First he's got to make
the grades to get in the school.

206
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,440
<i>Then he's got to make
the practice squad.</i>

207
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:50,941
And he's getting creamed
by guys twice his size.

208
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,177
<i>But he doesn't care because
it's all about the team.</i>

209
00:09:53,211 --> 00:09:56,613
And all he wants is to just once
to be on the list to dress for a game.

210
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:59,483
And it's the last game of his last year
of college and he's not on the list.

211
00:09:59,517 --> 00:10:01,252
- So one by one...
- Here it is.

212
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:02,720
The players come to
the coach's office

213
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:04,555
and put their jerseys
down on the desk.

214
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,858
- And say, "Coach"--
- "I want to take a shower with Rudy."

215
00:10:07,893 --> 00:10:09,561
No, they don't.

216
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,297
They walk in one by one,
put their jerseys on the desk

217
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:15,466
and say, "Coach, I want Rudy
to take my place on Saturday."

218
00:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,936
And there's a whole
line snaking out

219
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,105
of the coach's office of
players holding their jerseys.

220
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:23,508
- Jim, your forehead is bleeding.
- It is.

221
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:25,644
- I accidently hit him with a door.
- Twice.

222
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:27,879
Move your hair out of the way.

223
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:29,981
- It is bleeding.
- Could you grab the first aid kit?

224
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,415
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

225
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,950
- Where's Don?
- I don't know.

226
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:34,819
I saw him slip out
after Elliot's segment.

227
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:36,387
<i>Well, that's what
I want to talk about.</i>

228
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:38,856
We're 18 days into this
and I'm sick of pulling

229
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:40,858
pool feed from the wires.
I've seen the same footage

230
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:43,495
we're using licensed NBC
three times in the last two hours.

231
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,363
<i>Nilesat keeps
popping on and off.</i>

232
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,732
<i>And mostly, we can't cover this
from a hotel room.</i>

233
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:50,435
- We need someone on the ground.
- It's too dangerous on the ground.

234
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,438
- For an American.
- You want to get a stringer?

235
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:54,306
Someone local.
Someone who can blend in with the crowd.

236
00:10:54,341 --> 00:10:56,675
Someone who's credible with
both us and the protesters.

237
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,945
And someone who can shoot and
cut and knows to check audio.

238
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:02,481
You live on the Internet.
Have you been tracking anyone?

239
00:11:02,515 --> 00:11:04,950
I absolutely have the guy.

240
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:10,322
Excuse us.

241
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:19,431
Do you know what you're--
Ow.

242
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:21,400
Do you know what you're--
Ow.

243
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,435
Do you know what you're doing?
Ow.

244
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:26,171
- I could have been a doctor.
- What happened?

245
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:29,242
- Well, I didn't go to medical school or anything.
- Okay.

246
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,111
It's another <i>TMI</i> story.

247
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:33,913
And it'll be picked up
by Page Six.

248
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:36,181
- How many different ways
- It's online today,

249
00:11:36,216 --> 00:11:37,883
- do I have to say I'm not going to play on that court?
- and in print tomorrow.

250
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:40,519
- We have to engage this time.
- What does it say?

251
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:43,255
Did you know that your boy--
Did you know that Wade Campbell

252
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,690
is thinking about
running for Congress?

253
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,059
Yeah, he's thinking about it,
but not more than that.

254
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:50,729
Yes, more than that.
He's had meetings with senior staff of the DCCC.

255
00:11:50,764 --> 00:11:52,364
They're recruiting him
for Anthony Weiner's seat.

256
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,200
Anthony Weiner's keeping
Anthony Weiner's seat.

257
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,902
- Not if he runs for mayor.
- I didn't know that.

258
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:58,637
You've had Wade on the show
five times in six weeks.

259
00:11:58,672 --> 00:11:59,972
What's this story gonna be?

260
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,141
It's gonna be that you're
trying to get your boyfriend

261
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,176
elected to Congress.
What do you think it's gonna be?

262
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:07,980
When you put it like that,

263
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:09,882
I can see that that's what
it could look like.

264
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,083
That's what it does look like.

265
00:12:11,117 --> 00:12:12,251
He won't be on
the show anymore.

266
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:15,721
Guys, according to
Google Trends volume index,

267
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:18,891
since New Year's Eve,
the search term Will McAvoy

268
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:22,228
has spiked 35 times its average frequency
over the last three years.

269
00:12:22,262 --> 00:12:24,430
In less than six weeks,
there have been nine

270
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,298
negative mentions
in Page Six and <i>TMI</i>.

271
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:28,534
How many of their readers
do you think are our viewers?

272
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,536
Those articles have been
referenced or backlinked

273
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,038
- in over 800,000 websites.
<i>- Jesus!</i>

274
00:12:33,073 --> 00:12:34,673
- Yeah.
- There are 800,000 websites?

275
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,276
It's a daily distraction from
what we're trying to do here.

276
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:39,879
- First it was Will's dating disasters.
- I'm a great date.

277
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:42,515
Now we're playing it
fast and loose with ethics.

278
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,416
Whoa, that's only
what it looks like.

279
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:48,287
What else matters?
We're getting eaten alive by our own tabloid life.

280
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:50,723
Come on, chief, it's Mac.
She's annoyingly ethical.

281
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:54,093
- Thank you.
- Well, congratulations.

282
00:12:54,127 --> 00:12:57,029
You're now a boldfaced name.
You're in play.

283
00:12:57,063 --> 00:12:59,798
- Anything you do--
- I understand.

284
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:03,235
Come on.

285
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,507
How did you not know
he was talking--

286
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:11,810
He never told me.
You can't think I used you to raise his profile.

287
00:13:11,845 --> 00:13:13,412
I know for sure
you didn't use me.

288
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:16,248
He used me.

289
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,488
Hey, you know what?
Seriously.

290
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,691
Don't assume anything.
He seems like a good guy.

291
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:30,196
Plus, nobody in his right mind
would risk losing you.

292
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:33,000
Come on.

293
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,207
<i>Who's the stringer you've got?</i>

294
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,142
I've been following his Twitter feed
and YouTube posts.

295
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:43,645
- He goes by the name Amen.
- A-M-E-N?

296
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,213
- Like praise the Lord?
- That's how it's spelled.

297
00:13:45,247 --> 00:13:47,449
But it means "the hidden one"
in ancient Egyptian.

298
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,585
He's got a following
including Richard Engel

299
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:51,854
who says he's solid,
straightforward,

300
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,523
and fearless in the face
of all the chaos.

301
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:55,058
It's a nice endorsement
from Engel,

302
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,359
but I don't know about
using someone I don't know.

303
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,194
I know him.
He's just like me.

304
00:13:58,229 --> 00:14:00,463
- He is me.
- What do you mean?

305
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:04,467
Our fathers were
both mechanics.

306
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,302
<i>Not because it was
their dream job,</i>

307
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:08,704
<i>but because they knew there
was always work for mechanics.</i>

308
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,306
- Neal.
- We're both the eldest son

309
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,576
and have been taking care of
our siblings for most our lives.

310
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,445
Neither of us will ever
get a college degree.

311
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:19,114
We're both idealistic
about the Internet.

312
00:14:19,148 --> 00:14:20,615
Keep talking.

313
00:14:25,922 --> 00:14:29,259
- I was on one of the trains.
- 7/7?

314
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:34,998
I was going to visit my aunt,
and the train

315
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:37,668
had just left Liverpool Street,

316
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,837
and I was half asleep
when the bomb exploded.

317
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,271
What did you see?

318
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:44,074
The car filled with smoke,

319
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:47,578
people screaming, crying.

320
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:53,283
Praying.

321
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:57,321
Finally, an underground worker
in an orange vest got to us

322
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,723
<i>and started leading us up
the tunnel into King's Cross.</i>

323
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:01,391
And I pulled my cell phone
out to call my dad.

324
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,493
- There was no service.
<i>- Right.</i>

325
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,463
- So you started filming it instead.
- Yeah.

326
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:08,899
And I got out and I--

327
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,503
you know, I uploaded it
and I sent it to the news stations.

328
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,838
You knew then you weren't
going to be a mechanic.

329
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,040
- Yeah.
- He's Rudy.

330
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,910
- Not everything is <i>Rudy</i>.
- I know not everything is <i>Rudy</i>.

331
00:15:19,944 --> 00:15:22,279
Forget it.
Some people just don't understand <i>Rudy</i>.

332
00:15:22,313 --> 00:15:25,015
Just me and Rudy and Neal
and the guy Neal found in Cairo.

333
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,650
- Amen.
- Thank you.

334
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,485
No, his name is Amen.

335
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,222
And you can trust him.
He's gonna come through.

336
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:37,695
What kind of equipment
does he have?

337
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,698
A Kodak Zi8 HD handheld
and a laptop.

338
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,266
- You can find him?
- Yes.

339
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,934
- How will we get the signal?
- Why can't he use our uplink?

340
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,203
- We'd need a mobile.
- There's still the Internet.

341
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,504
There's been no Internet
since the 27th.

342
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,939
Not from the four major ISPs,

343
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:50,774
but there's a smaller
provider called the Noor Group,

344
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,858
and their main client is
the Egyptian Stock Exchange.

345
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:53,962
They can't shut that down.

346
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,247
Are you saying there's still
working Internet in Egypt?

347
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:59,317
Noor Group has 83 live
routes with successful pings

348
00:15:59,351 --> 00:16:01,886
on international
inbound transit.

349
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,389
- Are you saying there's still working Internet in Egypt?
- Yes.

350
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:07,158
- Will.
- Yeah?

351
00:16:07,192 --> 00:16:09,427
- I need you to fill in at 10:00.
- What happened?

352
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:12,363
Elliot left his hotel.
He went down to the street and he got beaten up.

353
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:14,465
What's his condition?

354
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,434
He's got a couple broken ribs,
a broken arm,

355
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:17,735
and cuts and bruises
around his face.

356
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,504
- He got beaten with a rock.
- Get him home.

357
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:22,940
- That's happening.
- What the hell was he doing on the street?

358
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,775
I'm gonna call his wife.

359
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,543
- <i>I'll do it.</i>
- No.

360
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:28,845
- Don.
- Charlie, let him do it.

361
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:34,284
Right away you say he's fine
and he's on his way home.

362
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:36,386
- Yeah.
- She doesn't need to know about the rock.

363
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:39,956
What the hell
was Elliot thinking?

364
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,091
He was thinking,
"Get the story."

365
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

366
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:49,099
What are you still doing here?

367
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,035
Right. Yes.
Come with me.

368
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:54,704
- I just heard about Elliot.
- He'll be okay.

369
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,673
- You're sure?
- No internal injuries.

370
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,242
Thank God.

371
00:16:58,276 --> 00:16:59,676
A few months ago,
I agreed to appear

372
00:16:59,711 --> 00:17:02,079
on a panel at the Paley
Center called

373
00:17:02,113 --> 00:17:05,115
- "Is TV News Equipped to Cover the Economy?"
- Excellent subject.

374
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,051
- <i>I think so, but here's the thing.</i>
- Yeah?

375
00:17:07,085 --> 00:17:10,187
I'm not equipped to cover the economy.
I don't know anything about economics.

376
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,255
I'm sure they're not expecting you to be an economist.
You're a producer.

377
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,759
Yeah, but what I'm saying is I don't know
<i>anything</i> about the economy.

378
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:17,527
Nothing.
I never studied it in school.

379
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:20,597
I never read the business section.
I never reported economic news.

380
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:21,764
You've been
producing economic news.

381
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,433
We've been doing five
minutes a night for months.

382
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:26,536
Yeah, I just set aside a five-minute block
and let you and Will go at it.

383
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:28,805
- You've been approving the subjects.
- I trust you.

384
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,140
What does that mean?

385
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,609
I pretend to read what
you give me and then I nod.

386
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:34,311
Okay, have you been
listening during the show?

387
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,413
- I have been listening very closely.
<i>- And?</i>

388
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,715
- I do not understand a word you're saying.
- Kenzie!

389
00:17:38,749 --> 00:17:40,684
Can we save the scolding,
Thomas Friedman?

390
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,752
- Do you mean Paul Krugman?
- Which one's the economist?

391
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:44,153
- Paul Krugman.
- Then that's who I meant.

392
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,055
I just need you to teach me

393
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:49,258
a couple of things to say that'll make it
look like I know something.

394
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,527
How long did it take
you to know what you know?

395
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:54,062
College, grad school,
doctorate, post-doctorate,

396
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:57,466
practical experience--
15 years. When's the panel?

397
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,067
- Tuesday. Morning.
- Okay.

398
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:01,203
How about I give you three things
you can write on your hand?

399
00:18:01,237 --> 00:18:04,239
No, I want to know this.
I think that a lot of what's going on in the world

400
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,575
- has to do with the economy.
- You may be on to something.

401
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,776
It's not like I need
to know everything.

402
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:09,211
You'll be in no danger of that.

403
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:10,713
- Joke well crafted.
- Thank you.

404
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:13,215
- <i>Go home.</i>
- Yup.

405
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,674
Welcome back to <i>ACN Morning</i>

406
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:41,043
where it's 22 minutes past the hour
on this cold New York--

407
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,613
- Very cold.
- Very cold February 11th in New York.

408
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:46,282
Coming up, we go behind the scenes
of the Jennifer Aniston comedy

409
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:47,750
<i>Just Go With It</i>
hitting theaters today.

410
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:50,319
And later we'll be live at the Cineplex
just up the street

411
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:52,789
where moviegoers are braving
freezing temperatures

412
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:56,893
just to be the very first to watch
<i>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</i>.

413
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,361
Do you have Bieber Fever?

414
00:18:58,396 --> 00:19:00,530
I'm not ashamed to say
I do have Bieber Fever.

415
00:19:00,564 --> 00:19:02,432
But right now it's time
to play a round of...

416
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:05,068
"What Caught My Eye."
I'll tell you what caught my eye this morning.

417
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,237
It was an item
about our own house.

418
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,640
<i>TMI</i> is reporting online that
<i>News Night</i> may be playing favorites

419
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:13,043
by boosting the profile
of the boyfriend

420
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:16,079
of its executive producer Mackenzie McHale.
Did you see that?

421
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,315
I did, but we don't know
the facts about that.

422
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,418
<i>Well, the facts are Mackenzie McHale
is the executive producer of </i>News Night<i>.</i>

423
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,722
Wade Campbell is her boyfriend.
Wade's got political ambitions.

424
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:26,757
<i>And he's turned up
as a guest on the show,</i>

425
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,694
<i>so the piece says,
five times in the last six weeks or so.</i>

426
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,429
<i>What do you think, ethical?</i>

427
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,864
Millie, put me through to
the day side control room.

428
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:36,266
I'll tell you what makes this
even a little more complicated.

429
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,303
- Tony.
- Mackenzie McHale and Will McAvoy used to be a couple.

430
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:43,573
So things have to be a little
tense on the prime time side.

431
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:44,941
Ask me how I know
they were a couple,

432
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,310
- <i>'cause this is a wild story.</i>
- The email.

433
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:50,413
<i>Mackenzie McHale sent a mass email
to every employee of AWM</i>

434
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:52,582
- saying that she had cheated on Will.
- Let's move on.

435
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:54,484
We've all done that, right?
I don't mean cheated.

436
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:56,119
<i>I mean we've all
hit the wrong key...</i>

437
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,388
This is Charlie Skinner.
Put me right in his fucking ear.

438
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:02,124
So we've got an anchor and an executive producer
who used to be involved...

439
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,593
<i>Hi. You've got 10 seconds</i>

440
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:06,929
<i>to take your show
gracefully to commercial</i>

441
00:20:06,963 --> 00:20:09,798
or so help me, Hannah,
you're not going to be

442
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,767
sitting in that chair
when we come back.

443
00:20:11,801 --> 00:20:13,435
Oh, well.
You get the picture.

444
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:17,806
We're gonna take a break
and come back after the break.

445
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,842
This is <i>ACN Morning</i>.

446
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,045
Very graceful.

447
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:35,159
She really wasn't ashamed
to say she had Bieber Fever?

448
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:41,766
It's all right.

449
00:20:46,672 --> 00:20:50,341
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh, wow.

450
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,478
I didn't--
I didn't realize it was Valentine's Day.

451
00:20:53,512 --> 00:20:55,279
And that people
in the office gave--

452
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:57,715
No, Valentine's Day is Monday,
not today,

453
00:20:57,749 --> 00:20:59,450
and these aren't for you,
they're from you.

454
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:00,718
I am more confused
than I was before.

455
00:21:00,753 --> 00:21:03,454
Don planned a beautiful night
for us on Monday.

456
00:21:03,488 --> 00:21:04,989
- You and me?
- Yes.

457
00:21:05,023 --> 00:21:07,058
Don planned a romantic
evening for you and me.

458
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,161
- Me and him.
- That makes more sense.

459
00:21:09,195 --> 00:21:11,363
And I don't want it to be ruined by Lisa,
who will ruin it

460
00:21:11,397 --> 00:21:13,365
if she doesn't have
a romantic Valentine's Day.

461
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,468
Last year her boyfriend
forgot it was Valentine's Day

462
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:18,070
and went to a Rangers game
with his friends.

463
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,972
She got drunk,
made us watch <i>Overboard</i>,

464
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:23,008
and reviewed every bad Valentine's Day
she's ever had,

465
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:25,510
which was all of them.
Not this year.

466
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:28,280
You're gonna be like
St. Valentine himself.

467
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:30,248
- St. Valentine actually--
- Focus, nerd.

468
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:33,017
- Okay.
- Don got us a room at the Four Seasons.

469
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,587
- Me and--
- Nope, still him and me.

470
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:39,424
The Four Seasons.
The bathtub fills up in less than 60 seconds.

471
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,293
And I don't want
Lisa showing up

472
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,161
with a copy of <i>The Notebook</i> saying,
"Where's the minibar?"

473
00:21:43,196 --> 00:21:46,298
Yeah, I can't hang out
with Lisa on Valentine's Day.

474
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,834
That-- That's making
a pretty strong statement.

475
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:51,236
Don't screw with me on this,
James Tiberius Harper.

476
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:54,606
That's not my middle name.
You're thinking of Captain James Tiberius Kirk--

477
00:21:54,641 --> 00:21:55,941
Do not screw me on this, Jim.

478
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:57,677
We're not in a relationship.

479
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:59,412
She calls me
at night after work.

480
00:21:59,446 --> 00:22:01,981
We talk for a minute and then she says,
"Should I come over?"

481
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:04,150
- And what am I supposed to say?
- You say yes.

482
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:05,585
I say yes.

483
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:08,521
If you're dating someone
on February 14th,

484
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,923
you take them out
on February 14th.

485
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,591
What's February 14th?

486
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:15,027
- Valentine's Day.
- Yes.

487
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:16,662
Here's your itinerary.

488
00:22:16,696 --> 00:22:18,998
You made reservations at
her favorite restaurant, Dell'anima.

489
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:21,934
You got her a horse charm
for her charm bracelet.

490
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:23,469
This is a bottle
of her favorite wine.

491
00:22:23,504 --> 00:22:25,371
And this is some
slutty lingerie

492
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:27,373
for whatever disgusting thing
you guys do later.

493
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,576
Oh, and the 60-second bathtub
is for hygiene?

494
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,644
You can't have sex in a bathtub.
It doesn't work.

495
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,347
Yes, it does.
You just have to slip yourself--

496
00:22:34,381 --> 00:22:35,815
- Thank you.
- I'd like to hear more.

497
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:37,150
- Shut up!
- Okay.

498
00:22:37,184 --> 00:22:38,585
Here is her card.

499
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:40,520
And here is what
you'll write on it.

500
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:42,355
"This has been the best
month of my life.

501
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,557
You are beautiful, talented,

502
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:46,959
and the most"--
Are you out of your mind?

503
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,995
- We've been on four dates.
- Look at me.

504
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:50,397
I already am.

505
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:56,002
Do. Not. Screw. Me.
On. This. Jim.

506
00:22:56,037 --> 00:23:00,473
- You pick her up at 9:30.
- Let's go.

507
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,678
<i>He's online.</i>

508
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:10,317
- Amen?
- Yes?

509
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:13,353
I'm Neal Sampat,
Atlantis Cable News in New York.

510
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:15,522
Did we communicate
about an hour ago?

511
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:16,823
Yes, we did.

512
00:23:18,626 --> 00:23:22,128
What did I say my favorite
kind of pizza was?

513
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:24,731
Plain pizza.
Cheese.

514
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:26,399
You're a purist.

515
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:29,002
It's true.

516
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,974
Amen, we'd like to pay you to be
our reporter on the ground.

517
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,976
You're obviously able to
move around out there.

518
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,578
Your quotes and sources
all check out.

519
00:23:37,612 --> 00:23:40,114
You're asking great questions
and you're posting great film.

520
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:43,350
- <i>Do we have a deal?</i>
- Yes, we have a deal.

521
00:23:43,385 --> 00:23:45,152
Good.

522
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:47,254
This is our executive producer.

523
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,891
That's the boss.
Her name is Mackenzie McHale.

524
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,095
Amen, thanks so much
for agreeing to help us.

525
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:55,997
Thank you for
broadcasting this.

526
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:58,733
<i>We go on the air
at 3:00 A.M. your time.</i>

527
00:23:58,768 --> 00:24:00,836
<i>And you'll be part of
the top story.</i>

528
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,206
I want you to report from
the middle of Tahrir Square.

529
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,876
But first, we need interviews.

530
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,878
We need you to go to the palace

531
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:11,515
<i>and find out who's in charge.</i>

532
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,051
- Can you do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

533
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:17,254
We need you to talk to
a member of the military

534
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,056
and see what their
marching orders are.

535
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,625
- Can you do that?
- Yes, ma'am.

536
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,861
Do you have a BeachTek
with an XLR adapter

537
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,395
so you can go wireless?

538
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,131
<i>I have a handheld directional,
but it works pretty well.</i>

539
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,266
Okay, but you'll have
to check your levels.

540
00:24:30,301 --> 00:24:32,268
We'll have a problem
with overmodulated sound.

541
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,872
- Got it.
- We're gonna need any B-roll you shot last night.

542
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,908
Can you compress it into
a YouSendlt file?

543
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:41,344
<i>It should be downloading
on your computer.</i>

544
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,647
It is.
Thank you.

545
00:24:44,682 --> 00:24:48,985
- Okay, one last thing.
<i>- Yes?</i>

546
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:51,420
We need you to take
off your bandana.

547
00:24:51,455 --> 00:24:55,557
<i>We have to ID you with your real name,
first and last.</i>

548
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:57,159
Do you understand?

549
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,861
That's necessary?

550
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:01,697
The report won't
have credibility

551
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:04,133
coming from
an anonymous reporter.

552
00:25:09,506 --> 00:25:13,609
Amen, every news outlet in the world
is gonna be there.

553
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:16,879
<i>But you'll be the first Egyptian reporter
on an American network</i>

554
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:18,914
<i>to describe what it's like
living through this</i>

555
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:21,284
<i>Berlin Wall moment
for the Middle East.</i>

556
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:25,054
This is history and
you'll never forget tonight.

557
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:30,726
Yes, of course.
You're right.

558
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:40,837
My name is Salim.
Kahlid Salim.

559
00:25:44,275 --> 00:25:46,977
Kahlid, let's go through
some technical details.

560
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,316
First of all,
how do you spell Kahlid?

561
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:55,652
<i>K-A-H-L...</i>

562
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,621
Are you gonna be nervous
about Leona

563
00:25:57,655 --> 00:25:59,422
if I look into the Koch brothers
on Wisconsin?

564
00:25:59,457 --> 00:26:01,358
Are you gonna be nervous
about more tabloid stories?

565
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:04,294
- Have I ever been nervous about the tabloid stories?
- You?

566
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:06,897
Would it make life easier for everyone
if I quietly resigned?

567
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:09,432
- No.
- No, and when was the last time you quietly did anything?

568
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,135
- I can be quiet.
- For instance, there was the time you sent an email

569
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:15,639
- to 138,000 people.
- I sent it to 112 people.

570
00:26:15,673 --> 00:26:18,241
- And then it got sent to--
- Will the two of you shut up?

571
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:20,243
This is exactly
the kind of story

572
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:22,812
Leona doesn't want
us to chase, so...

573
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,314
- Let's chase it as hard as we can?
- Yeah.

574
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:29,185
Do me a favor and see
if there's a connection

575
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
between the Koch brothers
and Citizens United.

576
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:33,523
- I'm way ahead of you.
- How?

577
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:37,360
Well, no, I'm exactly where you are.
It's just an expression.

578
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:40,897
Usually it takes decades,
even centuries,

579
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,632
for us to see the world change.

580
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:45,135
But in the Middle East,
the world has changed in seven weeks.

581
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:47,971
<i>January 25th,
protesters converged</i>

582
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,740
<i>on Cairo's Tahrir Square
demanding the resignation</i>

583
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,311
of President Hosni Mubarak,
who'd ruled Egypt for 30 years.

584
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:58,214
Last night Mubarak enraged
the Egyptian people by refusing to resign.

585
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,718
But just 24 hours later,
he bowed to the will of the people

586
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,954
and announced the following
through his vice president

587
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:05,822
- Omar Suleiman.
<i>- Roll 2, take it.</i>

588
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:09,960
<i>Dear citizens of these
difficult times...</i>

589
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:12,996
You're a handsome young man,
Kahlid.

590
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,731
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

591
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:17,834
- <i>Here's Tahrir Square just moments later.</i>
- <i>Roll 3.</i>

592
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,870
Take it.

593
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:23,707
They're chanting
"Egypt is free.

594
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,643
You're an Egyptian.
Lift up your head."

595
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,682
For more,
we're going live now to Cairo

596
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,685
where our reporter
Kahlid Salim is standing by.

597
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,387
Good morning, Kahlid.

598
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,456
It is a good morning.

599
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,590
30 seconds back.

600
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,325
- Will.
- Yeah?

601
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,227
I wanted to mention something to you,
just for what it's worth.

602
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,263
- <i>What?</i>
- I used to work at <i>TMI</i>.

603
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,898
<i>There was a rumor--
It was a little more than rumor--</i>

604
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:49,467
<i>that some of the guys at </i>TMI<i> would
take protection money.</i>

605
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,868
What are you talking about?

606
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,837
You give 'em money
and your name stays out.

607
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,939
You just get in touch with Nina Howard,
pay her what she wants--

608
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:56,408
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just mentioning it.

609
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,176
They took protection money at <i>TMI</i>?

610
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,378
<i>In three, two...</i>

611
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:04,182
Welcome back.
We go from Cairo to Madison, Wisconsin,

612
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:06,518
<i>where thousands of people are
converging on the statehouse</i>

613
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:09,321
<i>to protest Governor Scott Walker's
proposed budget bill.</i>

614
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,058
There it is.
Can you see us?

615
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,495
- Yes.
- That was real good work.

616
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,564
Thank you.
I've got some excellent footage

617
00:28:18,598 --> 00:28:20,432
of the disinfectant brigades.

618
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,100
What are
the disinfectant brigades?

619
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,636
Most of Tahrir is old ladies
sweeping up right now.

620
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,173
The kids changed the country,
then they brought in the moms to clean up after.

621
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,176
<i>The whole place
smells like Lysol.</i>

622
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,545
And they call it
a nonviolent revolution.

623
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,814
<i>I wouldn't say
it was a revolution.</i>

624
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:37,183
- Why's that?
- The army's still in charge.

625
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:40,387
So I suppose I'd call it
a military coup.

626
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:42,089
<i>But we'll get there.</i>

627
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:44,525
For the moment,
we traded an 82-year-old dictator

628
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,460
for a 79-year-old
field marshal

629
00:28:46,495 --> 00:28:47,995
who's been called
Mubarak's poodle.

630
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,763
Who called him
Mubarak's poodle?

631
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:51,565
Your State Department

632
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,501
in emails released
by WikiLeaks.

633
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:56,237
- WikiLeaks.
- <i>The army's not the good guys?</i>

634
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,272
I think that's where
to go with the story.

635
00:28:58,307 --> 00:29:00,208
Will there be free
and fair elections?

636
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:01,642
Will the army protect
pro-Mubarak thugs

637
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:04,345
<i>who killed hundreds in
the last two and a half weeks?</i>

638
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,848
I was in Tahrir the night
they killed 91.

639
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:09,884
Old men and children
beaten and shot.

640
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,186
Okay, brother,
where do you want to go next?

641
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:13,588
The Ministry of the Interior.

642
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:16,958
If Mubarak wanted to throw
you in a hole, that was it.

643
00:29:16,992 --> 00:29:18,459
The army's got it cordoned off

644
00:29:18,494 --> 00:29:20,662
and they're burning documents
in the courtyard.

645
00:29:20,696 --> 00:29:22,697
- That's a government building.
- He's all right.

646
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:24,798
Kahlid, you get us film
of the army burning evidence

647
00:29:24,833 --> 00:29:28,068
and I'll personally come down there
with a truckload of Lemon Pledge.

648
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:30,204
<i>I won't let you down with this.</i>

649
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:33,273
You understand the difference between
a commercial bank and an investment bank?

650
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:34,641
- Of course.
- Kenzie?

651
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:36,843
- No.
- Investment banks are gamblers.

652
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,946
Commercial banks are where you have
a savings account and a checking account.

653
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:42,382
- Can you balance your checkbook?
- Yes.

654
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,984
- Kenzie?
- No.

655
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,886
All right,
so after the Great Depression,

656
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,621
Congress wanted
to put a firewall

657
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,423
between the investment banks
and the commercial banks.

658
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:52,293
They wanted to make sure that Wall Street
could melt to the ground

659
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:54,528
and the commercial banks
wouldn't be touched.

660
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:57,398
They passed a law,
the Glass-Steagall Act.

661
00:29:57,432 --> 00:30:00,134
Now you could be Gordon Gekko
or George Bailey,

662
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:03,604
but you couldn't be both.

663
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:06,507
You with me?

664
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,576
I can't seem to stop hurting Will.

665
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,479
This morning was just fucked up.

666
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,915
Day side at this place
just resents prime time.

667
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,350
And that's all that was.

668
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,386
- Is Will mad at you?
- No.

669
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,088
That probably
makes you feel worse.

670
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,457
And my saying that just then
probably makes you feel

671
00:30:22,492 --> 00:30:24,126
a lot worse than you did
a couple seconds ago.

672
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,027
Do you have any
human knowledge?

673
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,562
I have been told I do not.

674
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,433
Let's keep going.

675
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:33,334
I can't help but think this is all
partially my fault.

676
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:36,037
I'm the one who didn't believe you
when you told me that Will didn't cheat on you

677
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:38,139
- and that's why you--
- I had to send the email, right.

678
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:40,140
Don't be ridiculous.
It's <i>completely</i> your fault.

679
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:43,309
It's so unbelievably your--
No.

680
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,578
I'm the closest thing to a female friend
that you have, right?

681
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:48,280
Wait, are you saying that
I don't have female friends

682
00:30:48,315 --> 00:30:49,515
or that you're not
entirely female?

683
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,017
- Which do you think?
- The first.

684
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:54,053
Yes. So what happened
and why can't it be fixed?

685
00:30:55,956 --> 00:31:00,226
What happened was
I was with a guy for a long time

686
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,695
who wasn't half the man that Will is
and he dumped me.

687
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:05,864
- Later I started seeing Will.
- I can fill in the rest of the story.

688
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,966
- Why can't it be fixed?
- Listen, do you mind if we just talk--

689
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,603
- Yeah, Glass-Steagall.
- The firewall, it worked?

690
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,905
It helped lead to
the largest sustained period

691
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,574
of economic growth
in US history,

692
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,776
a 60-year expansion
of the middle class,

693
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,611
the largest increase
in productivity,

694
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,413
and the largest increase
in median income.

695
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:23,416
We also won World War II,
put a man on the moon

696
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,451
and a computer in
everyone's lap.

697
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:27,387
And you know what
happened next?

698
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,856
We cheated on the perfect guy
with a guy who dumped us?

699
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,825
Yes.

700
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:33,793
We repealed Glass-Steagall.

701
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,200
Why can't it be fixed?

702
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:47,373
Hey, I've got to write something on
a Valentine's card.

703
00:31:47,408 --> 00:31:50,309
You're used to deceiving women.
What would you write--

704
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,144
- I can't find Kahlid.
- What do you mean?

705
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,413
I haven't heard from him
since Saturday night his time

706
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,416
and he hasn't updated
his Twitter or Facebook.

707
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:58,050
- Have you tried contacting--
- All his contacts--

708
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:00,186
Facebook, YouTube--
No one's heard from him.

709
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,022
Guys, Elliot Hirsch.

710
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,928
Thank you.

711
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,564
I'm fine, really.

712
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,168
And thanks, everyone,
for the calls and the emails and the flowers.

713
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:19,904
And the stripper dressed as
a pro-Mubarak security officer.

714
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:22,807
You wouldn't think they'd
have that outfit in storage.

715
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:25,243
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

716
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,545
- Charlie.
- Hang on.

717
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,213
Welcome back, Elliot.

718
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,382
- Everyone's really happy you're all right.
- Thanks, man.

719
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,817
The coverage from the stringer,
it was great Friday night.

720
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,719
- They told me that was you.
- Yeah.

721
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:40,155
But I can't find him.
It's been about 36 hours.

722
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,258
- Did you try--
- I've tried everything.

723
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:45,060
All right,
he's got our satellite phone.

724
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:46,729
The one the two
of us were using.

725
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:49,532
You can get the provider to run a GPS trace
to tell you where the phone is.

726
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,701
Good. Thank you.

727
00:32:51,735 --> 00:32:54,904
Did someone here
order a fascist thug?

728
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,273
<i>No, we did this already.</i>

729
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,810
- He's home.
- Thank you, God.

730
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,579
I can't hug you, right?

731
00:33:02,613 --> 00:33:04,414
No, my ribs.

732
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:06,450
All right.

733
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:10,687
- Elliot.
- Yes, sir?

734
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,155
Don't ever fucking
do that again.

735
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,524
- Yes, sir.
- Will filled in Friday night.

736
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:17,060
I'll have Becky fill in tonight
and until you're ready to--

737
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,363
No, that's why we're here.
I want him on the air tonight.

738
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,632
- And shoot him from the neck down?
- No, we show what's going on.

739
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,901
- Journalists are getting beaten up.
- I know, but--

740
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,771
He took the lead for ACN on
the biggest international story in a decade.

741
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,873
- You can't take him off.
- It'll just be for a week.

742
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,241
- Just till my face heals--
- You don't want to go on?

743
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:33,612
- Of course I want to go on.
- Then that's it.

744
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:35,947
This is a great reporter
who brought us a great story.

745
00:33:35,982 --> 00:33:37,949
I didn't bring any story.
I got beaten up before--

746
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,552
That's the story.

747
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:43,287
No, I didn't mean that
that's the story.

748
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:45,223
I meant that-- Yes,
I know that we're not the story,

749
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:47,759
but, Jesus, God damn it,
nobody's ever gonna know that he--

750
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:49,694
- We know.
- That's not good enough.

751
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:52,263
Yes, it is.

752
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:54,999
Fine.

753
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,669
And the media, we're all effete,
elitist assholes.

754
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:01,238
We're blow-dried clowns sitting in an ivory tower.
Just look.

755
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,674
You're benched.

756
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:11,416
- <i>Will.</i>
- Yeah?

757
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,984
I need to talk to you.

758
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:17,887
<i>First, Maria Guerrero wanted me to
relay a message that she feels terrible.</i>

759
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,613
Why isn't she saying
that herself?

760
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:22,503
- She's terrified of you.
- That's fair.

761
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:24,995
Look, Tony thinks prime time
looks down their nose at day side.

762
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,505
- That's all that was about.
- Well, he really turned me around.

763
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:30,581
Tell Maria I saw her try to stop it
and I appreciate it.

764
00:34:30,605 --> 00:34:33,986
I will, but I came here to tell you that
Nina Howard is getting ready to run another piece.

765
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,109
I don't care.
Nina can write whatever she wants about me.

766
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,510
It's about Mac.

767
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,916
What is she writing?

768
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,453
Did she almost get her crew killed
during an incident in Pakistan?

769
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,689
You've got her number?

770
00:34:51,693 --> 00:34:53,827
This really works?

771
00:34:53,862 --> 00:34:55,862
If it were me, I'd try it.

772
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:58,498
We're in the conference room.

773
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:01,268
Gary, why don't you tell
your friends on day side

774
00:35:01,302 --> 00:35:04,738
that if they've got any questions about
Mackenzie's ethics, they can come see me.

775
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:06,807
Yeah.

776
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,877
- Get your head looked at?
- Just needed a couple stiches.

777
00:35:22,522 --> 00:35:26,792
The answer is yes,
the Koch brothers had money in Citizens United.

778
00:35:26,826 --> 00:35:30,061
A number of Koch-funded groups
submitted amicus briefs to the court,

779
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:32,496
<i>including the Cato Institute,
which the Kochs funded.</i>

780
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:35,766
They submitted a brief calling
for unfettered corporate speech.

781
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,236
So did the Institute for Justice,
also funded by the Kochs.

782
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:42,606
Their brief said that
finance laws prohibiting

783
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,709
unlimited corporate contributions
trumped the First Amendment.

784
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,078
And after the court ruled
in their favor,

785
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:50,381
these groups spent
a lot of money

786
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,016
to oppose efforts
to provide transparency.

787
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,751
Here's an interview with
David Koch and his lawyer.

788
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,887
Koch's asked about
Citizens United

789
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,722
and he seems to pretend
he's never heard of it.

790
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,525
Koch is in the foreground
in the grey herringbone coat.

791
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,794
<i>What do you think
of Citizens United?</i>

792
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,431
- <i>Has it helped your influence?</i>
- Citizens United?

793
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,102
<i>What do you think
of Citizens United?</i>

794
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,806
- <i>Has it helped your influence?</i>
- Citizens United?

795
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,441
One more time.

796
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,443
<i>What do you think
of Citizens United?</i>

797
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:22,248
- <i>Has it helped your influence?</i>
- Citizens United?

798
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:26,219
Justices Thomas and Scalia

799
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:28,321
have both been frequent guests
of the Kochs.

800
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,891
And between 2003 and 2007,

801
00:36:30,925 --> 00:36:33,527
Virginia Thomas,
wife of Justice Thomas,

802
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:37,398
<i>was paid $686,589</i>

803
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:38,966
by the Heritage Foundation,

804
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,769
<i>which was funded
by David and Charles Koch.</i>

805
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:46,207
For whatever reason,
Justice Thomas didn't disclose the 686,000

806
00:36:46,241 --> 00:36:48,709
on his Supreme Court
financial disclosure form.

807
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,844
Is it very unusual
that Scalia and Thomas

808
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,480
didn't recuse themselves
from the case?

809
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:55,716
If they had,
Citizens United would have lost 4-3.

810
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:59,253
All right, the Citizens United decision
allowed corporations

811
00:36:59,287 --> 00:37:02,523
to donate unlimited amounts of money
to any political candidate

812
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:04,425
without anyone knowing
where the money was coming from.

813
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:07,194
But it also did the same thing for the unions,
and they knew that.

814
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:11,399
So wouldn't the next step be
to get rid of the unions?

815
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:12,834
If you're rigging the game, yes.

816
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:15,536
Excuse me. Kahlid's gone.

817
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,705
The satellite service says
his phone isn't giving a signal,

818
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,674
which means it's either destroyed
or very deep underground.

819
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:23,944
We sent him to get evidence of the army
burning documents. He's been taken.

820
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:26,980
We have a local security contractor in Cairo.
I'll start with them.

821
00:37:27,015 --> 00:37:30,017
Will, you call your highest contact
at the State Department.

822
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:31,519
And then call her husband
if you have to.

823
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:33,187
Don, you've got contacts at
the Egyptian embassy.

824
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:34,555
- I used to.
- What do you mean?

825
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,023
Their government
was just dissolved.

826
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:38,726
Aw, come on.
We put the guy in that place.

827
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,962
- Neal, we're not losing him.
- Jesus.

828
00:37:41,997 --> 00:37:43,998
- Do you have contacts in the Egyptian army?
- I do.

829
00:37:44,032 --> 00:37:46,266
So do I.
We can retrace his steps.

830
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:48,869
<i>Snerdly, have you heard this?</i>

831
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:52,206
<i>The Egyptian army is rounding up
foreign journalists.</i>

832
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,442
I mean, even two <i>New York Times</i> reporters
were detained.

833
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:58,812
Now this is supposed to
make us feel what exactly?

834
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:01,047
- <i>Are we supposed to feel outrage?</i>
- Neal.

835
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:03,116
<i>I don't feel
any outrage over it.</i>

836
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,819
Are we supposed to feel anger?

837
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:07,954
I don't feel any anger
over this.

838
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:10,990
Do we feel happy?

839
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:15,195
Well, do we feel...

840
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:18,031
kind of going like,
"Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah"?

841
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:22,703
Do we feel happy?

842
00:38:24,072 --> 00:38:27,541
<i>Well, do we feel...</i>

843
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:30,478
kind of going like,
"Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah"?

844
00:38:30,512 --> 00:38:32,547
- Oh!
- Neal!

845
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:34,315
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

846
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:37,285
Give me your hand.
Come on, give me your hand.

847
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,855
You broke a couple fingers.
Come on. Come on.

848
00:38:42,324 --> 00:38:44,359
- I'm sorry.
- Shh, shh.

849
00:38:44,393 --> 00:38:46,627
Let's go.

850
00:38:49,565 --> 00:38:52,433
Corporate legal won't let us
work with security in Cairo.

851
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:55,036
- Why the hell not?
- They don't want to assume liability for a freelancer.

852
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,871
They say he can
turn around and sue us.

853
00:38:56,905 --> 00:38:59,139
Sue us?
He's either a prisoner or dead.

854
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:00,641
Let's talk to Reese.

855
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:02,176
I'm the one of us
who's pissed him off the least.

856
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,911
Let me do the talking.

857
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:09,150
- He's not in, Don.
- I think he is, Roberta.

858
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,852
- Don.
- Reese, get the fuck out here.

859
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:13,721
<i>Don, he's not in.</i>

860
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:16,757
Oh, God!
Fuck!

861
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:18,960
It's a strong door.

862
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:24,333
So, do you know
where he can be reached?

863
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:29,739
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
30 minutes to air.</i>

864
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:32,642
<i>We are live in 30 minutes.</i>

865
00:39:39,618 --> 00:39:41,919
I'm gonna put someone's head
through a fucking pyramid.

866
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:45,023
Now get me somebody on the phone who--
Thank you.

867
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,632
- You all right?
- Yeah. It's sprained.

868
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,801
- The shoulder?
- Yeah.

869
00:39:57,836 --> 00:40:00,771
- Donnie--
- I sent him down there.

870
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:04,375
I bullied him into going out on the street
and they beat him up with a rock.

871
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:08,412
He went out there
because I told him to.

872
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,347
I know.

873
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:12,750
Everybody knows.
We're all jealous.

874
00:40:12,784 --> 00:40:14,853
We wish it was us
with the bruises on our face.

875
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:19,724
You didn't give him an order.
You gave him permission.

876
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,559
<i>I got him!</i>

877
00:40:26,064 --> 00:40:27,698
The army's got him.
They denied it until they realized

878
00:40:27,732 --> 00:40:29,933
somebody with money was looking for him.
They say that--

879
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:32,035
- A fringe group has him.
- Yeah, but it's them.

880
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:33,703
<i>What does
the fringe group want?</i>

881
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:35,438
A quarter of a million dollars, US.

882
00:40:35,472 --> 00:40:38,975
<i>I'm gonna quietly run this by
some people in private security</i>

883
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:41,577
just to make sure it checks out,
but, Will,

884
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:45,081
you're the only one who can get corporate
to make this wire transfer.

885
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,749
You got the information
on the transfer?

886
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:49,218
Nobody has to leave a bag of cash
on top of a mailbox?

887
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:52,221
No, they want you to wire
the money to a charity

888
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:55,825
called Intisar Charity
Benevolence Fund.

889
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:57,627
They're practically
letting us use PayPal.

890
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:58,828
A charity in Cairo?

891
00:40:58,863 --> 00:41:00,597
No, a commodities trading
fund in Dubai.

892
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:03,700
Talk to your people
and I'll deal with corporate.

893
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,669
How you feeling?

894
00:41:05,703 --> 00:41:08,605
- I feel great.
- I'm sorry.

895
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:13,510
I'm tough on you
and I'm--

896
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:15,379
I'm so sorry.

897
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:18,115
You couldn't have stopped me.

898
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:27,890
<i>Thursday night,
it was 75 teachers in Appleton.</i>

899
00:41:27,925 --> 00:41:30,126
Tonight, the number of
protesters in Madison

900
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:31,828
is estimated at 30,000.

901
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,864
Governor Walker's office
is feeding inside information

902
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,766
about their intentions
to friendly groups

903
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,268
who in turn are paying
to fill hearing rooms

904
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:41,271
with supporters
of Walker's plan.

905
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:43,073
Wade's here.

906
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:46,109
He says you haven't
returned his calls or texts

907
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:47,510
and he's not leaving
until you speak to him.

908
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:50,547
Have him wait on the terrace.

909
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,951
It's about 10 degrees outside.

910
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:58,455
<i>The reelected governor gave
$140 million in tax breaks,</i>

911
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:01,758
is being balanced on the backs
of public sector workers who,

912
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:05,562
organizations like Americans for Prosperity
believe, are overpaid.

913
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:06,964
You deserved a lot better.

914
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:09,366
<i>We'll let you decide
if they're overpaid.</i>

915
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,602
- I deserved what I got.
- <i>The low income threshold in the US</i>

916
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:15,672
<i>is $45,000 a year
for a family of four.</i>

917
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:19,076
<i>Average salary for an employee of
the Health Services Department--</i>

918
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,044
<i>$45,805.</i>

919
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:25,616
Children and Families Agency--
$47,810.

920
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,087
Workforce Development Agency:
$46,074.

921
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:33,023
And the average salary
for a public school teacher

922
00:42:33,057 --> 00:42:34,691
in Wisconsin--

923
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:39,762
$46,390.

924
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:49,037
Finally.
Why'd I have to wait out here?

925
00:42:49,071 --> 00:42:51,839
Because I wanted you to.

926
00:42:53,142 --> 00:42:54,609
I've been calling you all day.

927
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:56,944
Yeah, when was your first
meeting with the DCCC?

928
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:00,782
Look, we have to
work together on this.

929
00:43:00,816 --> 00:43:03,251
No, we can't work together.

930
00:43:03,285 --> 00:43:06,388
And because you're not a moron,
you already know that.

931
00:43:06,422 --> 00:43:08,256
Hey, High Road,

932
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:11,326
were you ever gonna tell me
that you and Will were together?

933
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,995
This was never gonna work,
you and me.

934
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,765
<i>You wasted my time.</i>

935
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,200
So I got something out of it.

936
00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:20,369
In this order-- Leave,

937
00:43:20,403 --> 00:43:23,005
lose the election,

938
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,340
go to hell.

939
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:36,151
She's in the back.

940
00:43:36,185 --> 00:43:39,488
Anyone comes in I don't want to see,
just buzz my BlackBerry.

941
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:56,371
I want this to stop.

942
00:43:56,406 --> 00:43:59,707
I was rude to you at a party
and I apologize.

943
00:44:00,676 --> 00:44:02,510
Be a bigger narcissist.

944
00:44:02,544 --> 00:44:05,746
You think this is happening because
you didn't take me home on New Year's Eve?

945
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,983
Your ex booked her
boyfriend five times--

946
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:11,284
If you called for a comment,
I could have told you that I was the one--

947
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:14,120
Bullshit you want your ex
dating a congressman.

948
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,156
- She didn't know the DCCC was--
- Says you.

949
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,791
- Says her.
- Yeah.

950
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:21,160
All right, the ethics
of Wade coming on the show,

951
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:23,496
that was fair.
You had every right to run that.

952
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:25,198
But to say that she almost
got someone killed--

953
00:44:25,232 --> 00:44:28,669
I'm running a piece saying
you hired an incompetent EP

954
00:44:28,703 --> 00:44:31,105
because she was your girlfriend
and she dumped you.

955
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,207
I hired the best EP
in broadcasting

956
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:35,310
in spite of her being my ex-girlfriend
who dumped me.

957
00:44:35,344 --> 00:44:38,112
You know, you guys up there
are millionaires--

958
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:40,981
- I'm the only millionaire up there.
- And celebrities.

959
00:44:41,016 --> 00:44:43,984
- I'm the only celebrity up there.
- Not anymore.

960
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,285
How does this work?

961
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,654
I'm thinking

962
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:51,257
about investing in a restaurant

963
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:53,126
and I'm looking
for silent partners.

964
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:55,128
$50,000 a share.

965
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,630
- $50,000 and I'm a silent partner?
- Yes.

966
00:44:57,664 --> 00:45:00,433
- And you're a silent partner?
- Quiet as a mouse.

967
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:04,904
- For good?
- You'll have your own table at the restaurant for life.

968
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:14,513
Hey, Will...

969
00:45:15,749 --> 00:45:17,250
we're journalists.

970
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:24,191
- I wish you hadn't said that.
- What?

971
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:27,261
Everything would have been cool if you hadn't said that.
You just talk too much.

972
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:29,463
You have a problem with me
calling myself a journalist?

973
00:45:29,497 --> 00:45:32,400
Only the elite few

974
00:45:32,434 --> 00:45:35,069
who cover stories nobody cares about
get to call themselves--

975
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:38,739
I've got a guy on my staff who got hit
in the head with a glass door Thursday.

976
00:45:38,774 --> 00:45:41,508
His forehead wouldn't stop bleeding,
but he wouldn't go to a doctor

977
00:45:41,543 --> 00:45:44,045
'cause I got another guy
who got beat up covering Cairo.

978
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,115
And the first guy wouldn't see a doctor
until the second guy saw a doctor.

979
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:49,685
I've got a producer
who ran into a locked door

980
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,820
'cause he felt responsible
for the second guy.

981
00:45:51,855 --> 00:45:53,622
I've got an 18-year-old kid
risking his life

982
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:56,558
halfway around the world,
and the AP who sent him there

983
00:45:56,593 --> 00:45:58,160
hasn't slept in three days.

984
00:45:58,194 --> 00:46:01,930
I've got 20-somethings who care about
teachers in Wisconsin.

985
00:46:01,964 --> 00:46:04,899
I've got a grown woman who has to
subtract with her fingers

986
00:46:04,934 --> 00:46:07,135
staying up all night
trying to learn economics

987
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:09,971
from a PhD who could be
making 20 times the money

988
00:46:10,005 --> 00:46:12,673
three miles downtown.
They're journalists.

989
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,643
Come after me all you want,
Nina.

990
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:18,679
Come after me every day.
Look through my garbage.

991
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:21,415
Invent things out of thin air.
That's what you're paid for.

992
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,586
But you touch my staff and you are
walking into a world of hurt.

993
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,222
I have an hour
of prime time every night

994
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:32,059
and I will rededicate my life
to ruining yours.

995
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,863
I also want you to send
a message up the chain

996
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:38,466
of whatever
backroom machinery is driving this

997
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,404
that if I so much as smell Leona Lansing's
perfume on any of this,

998
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:45,140
I'm going to make a meal
out of both of you

999
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:47,543
and I won't stop
until I'm done.

1000
00:46:47,578 --> 00:46:50,780
Look at me...

1001
00:46:50,815 --> 00:46:53,550
and see that I'm dead serious.

1002
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,594
Restaurants are
bad investments.

1003
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:06,063
Wait 20 minutes
before you leave here.

1004
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,267
Tough-ass speech...

1005
00:47:12,337 --> 00:47:14,571
- but you're not gonna win.
- I don't care.

1006
00:47:14,606 --> 00:47:17,474
I'm just a middle-aged man who never
lived up to his potential.

1007
00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:20,410
You don't want to be on
the wrong end of me if I ever do.

1008
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:22,713
I got the drinks.

1009
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,051
1980, Ronald Reagan
is elected president

1010
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,753
and the culture
of deregulation begins.

1011
00:47:28,787 --> 00:47:31,989
What happened to Will?
I haven't seen him around.

1012
00:47:32,024 --> 00:47:34,292
He changed and ran out
right after the show.

1013
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:36,561
Where?

1014
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:39,431
The culture of deregulation
culminates in 1999.

1015
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:42,400
- Glass-Steagall gets repealed.
- And immediately banks start merging.

1016
00:47:42,435 --> 00:47:44,002
Now Gordon Gekko

1017
00:47:44,036 --> 00:47:46,305
can use George Bailey's
bank balance to make bets.

1018
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:47,840
<i>Where's James Harper?!</i>

1019
00:47:47,874 --> 00:47:50,309
<i>That's Lisa.</i>

1020
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:52,645
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God.

1021
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:55,914
It-- It's Valentine's Day.
I forgot to meet her.

1022
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,950
James Harper?!
Nobody?

1023
00:47:57,984 --> 00:48:01,020
<i>If he is not here,
I will stand here...</i>

1024
00:48:01,054 --> 00:48:02,555
- What are you doing?
<i>- Hiding.</i>

1025
00:48:02,589 --> 00:48:04,490
- Does this seem like a good plan to you?
<i>- No.</i>

1026
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:06,425
- Get up. Get up!
<i>- Please don't make me.</i>

1027
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:12,698
<i>But I'm looking for Jim
because he did not come.</i>

1028
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:14,567
- Anyone? James?
- Lisa.

1029
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:16,569
I am so sorry.
It's been a very chaotic day.

1030
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,003
Where the fuck have you been?

1031
00:48:20,473 --> 00:48:22,607
- Like I said, it's been--
- You don't know how to use a phone?

1032
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:26,111
I might have a concussion,
but still, I'm sorry.

1033
00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:29,248
You're sorry? All right,
in that case, I totally forgive you

1034
00:48:29,282 --> 00:48:31,383
for making me wait alone
in a restaurant for an hour.

1035
00:48:31,418 --> 00:48:32,818
I appreciate that.

1036
00:48:32,852 --> 00:48:34,386
- Unless you're being sarcastic.
- She was.

1037
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:35,754
I thought there was
an outside chance--

1038
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:37,223
- Did you get any of my messages?
- No.

1039
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:38,724
- Wait, are you Lisa?
- Yes.

1040
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:40,092
- I got your messages.
- What?

1041
00:48:40,127 --> 00:48:42,028
We accidentally
switched phones again.

1042
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,497
- What happened to marking them with nail polish?
- We both did that.

1043
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:46,799
You stood me up on
Valentine's Day,

1044
00:48:46,834 --> 00:48:49,368
which is 1,000 times worse
than a regular stand up.

1045
00:48:49,403 --> 00:48:51,037
- I didn't stand you up.
- Yes, you did.

1046
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:54,440
Yes, I did.
But I have presents.

1047
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:58,011
And I wrote you a card.

1048
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:01,680
"From the desk
of James Harper."

1049
00:49:01,715 --> 00:49:03,082
- Are you kidding?
- I lost the card.

1050
00:49:03,116 --> 00:49:04,750
- You're a jerk.
- No, he's not.

1051
00:49:04,785 --> 00:49:06,018
- Maggie.
- Lisa, stop.

1052
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:07,654
- You know what?
- Stop!

1053
00:49:07,688 --> 00:49:09,756
Jim did everything right here.

1054
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,125
- Well, he left me alone in a restaurant for an hour.
- Except that.

1055
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:13,626
- And didn't call.
- And that.

1056
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:16,162
It would be hard for a casual observer
to tell which side--

1057
00:49:16,196 --> 00:49:19,165
Shut up.
Lisa, he's a very decent guy.

1058
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,667
- This isn't anyone's fault.
- It's his.

1059
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:24,203
It's a little bit his,
but mostly

1060
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:25,905
it's just a very bad day.

1061
00:49:25,939 --> 00:49:29,308
It's Valentine's Day.
It's my favorite day.

1062
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,377
Then pick another day!

1063
00:49:31,412 --> 00:49:33,313
Because it's every guy's
least favorite day.

1064
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:35,716
Everyone's always disappointed.

1065
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,385
Valentine's Day
is the bully of holidays.

1066
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:40,654
It forces love on people
who aren't in love.

1067
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:42,222
- Cupid's freakish.
- All right.

1068
00:49:42,256 --> 00:49:45,359
No, I'm boycotting
Valentine's Day from now on.

1069
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:47,794
Who's with me?

1070
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:51,832
I love you every day.

1071
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,801
Today's just an excuse
to spend the night in a hotel room.

1072
00:49:57,606 --> 00:49:59,841
I'm sorry.
I was faking it just then.

1073
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:03,077
I think she can still hear you.

1074
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:07,749
I'm sorry.

1075
00:50:07,783 --> 00:50:09,484
I'm really sorry.

1076
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:14,590
I'm still wearing
edible underwear.

1077
00:50:14,624 --> 00:50:18,427
- Well, if I'd known that...
- Shut up!

1078
00:50:20,363 --> 00:50:22,031
<i>It's one big Jenga tower.</i>

1079
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:23,733
You pull a piece out,
put it on top,

1080
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,334
and the tower definitely
gets higher,

1081
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,303
but also gets less stable.

1082
00:50:27,337 --> 00:50:29,672
Will's back.

1083
00:50:31,842 --> 00:50:33,810
Let's do this.

1084
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,515
Oi.

1085
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:47,223
- Where have you been?
- I had to run an errand.

1086
00:50:47,258 --> 00:50:49,926
- What kind of errand?
- I wanted some gum. Got it.

1087
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,795
Let me tell you something, Billy.

1088
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:54,130
I ever find out you paid
a gossip columnist money

1089
00:50:54,165 --> 00:50:56,166
to protect me,
I will beat you senseless.

1090
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,768
- And you know I can do it because I'm crafty.
- I know.

1091
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:00,838
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

1092
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,608
I hear corporate
wired the money.

1093
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:06,543
- Kahlid's home.
- Yeah.

1094
00:51:06,578 --> 00:51:09,312
<i>Funny, because legal
wouldn't even let us talk</i>

1095
00:51:09,347 --> 00:51:11,215
to our own security about Kahlid
because of the exposure.

1096
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:14,251
- They changed their mind.
- Hmm.

1097
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:16,920
Did you know that it
was Bill Clinton

1098
00:51:16,955 --> 00:51:18,655
who signed the repeal
of Glass-Steagall?

1099
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,858
Yeah.
Everybody knows that.

1100
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:24,061
Well, now everybody knows it.

1101
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:26,330
How are the lessons going?

1102
00:51:26,364 --> 00:51:29,733
Corporate didn't wire anything.
You did.

1103
00:51:32,203 --> 00:51:34,070
He's one of our guys.

1104
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,874
Yeah.

1105
00:51:40,578 --> 00:51:42,879
Speaking of which...

1106
00:51:49,987 --> 00:51:52,589
It's not much,
but I'd like to help with this.

1107
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:56,660
- Neal, you can't afford it.
- Please.

1108
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,530
Sure.
Thank you.

1109
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:06,938
All right, so I'd--

1110
00:52:09,242 --> 00:52:11,243
- It's not much.
- Maggie.

1111
00:52:11,277 --> 00:52:13,779
<i>Please.</i>

1112
00:52:13,813 --> 00:52:17,217
- What's this in the memo line?
- Read it.

1113
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:19,920
"Coach."

1114
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:13,774
We want Rudy to dress
for the game, Coach.

1115
00:53:13,808 --> 00:53:16,076
You guys are missing
your fife and drum.

1116
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,258
You did this?

1117
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,628
Happy Valentine's Day.

1118
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:56,816
