1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,842
- This is my friend Wade Campbell.
- She's so British.

2
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:04,911
- We're a little more than friends.
- Good to meet you.

3
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:09,048
- Mackenzie: I'm sorry.
- No, this is exactly what was supposed to happen.

4
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,852
You two have broken up four times
and gotten together five times,

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,455
so there must be
a strong connection.

6
00:00:13,489 --> 00:00:14,622
- Was that sarcastic?
- No.

7
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:16,192
<i>You guys obviously
have something.</i>

8
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:18,829
<i>My suggestion is
stop breaking up.</i>

9
00:00:18,864 --> 00:00:19,997
Learn how to have a fight.

10
00:00:20,032 --> 00:00:22,501
Lisa, are you still there?
That was him.

11
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:24,538
Will: <i>The Tea Party
is being radicalized</i>

12
00:00:24,572 --> 00:00:26,774
and their original
principles obliterated.

13
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:28,576
The health care law
hasn't taken effect yet.

14
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,139
TARP was signed into law
by George W. Bush.

15
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:33,774
He's gonna tone it down
or I'm gonna fire him.

16
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,809
You'd manufacture
a reason to do it?

17
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:37,577
I've got a really good job,
Charlie.

18
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,448
In six weeks I haven't heard
anything from the 44th floor.

19
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,550
- How are they with this?
- Good. Good.

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,120
I'll tell you when there's
something to worry about.

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,691
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

22
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:49,786
Hey.
I thought I saw you sneak in.

23
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:52,055
- You look nice.
- Thanks. So do you.

24
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,790
Oh, yeah.
I was at a party at Bloomberg's.

25
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,092
But you came here to be with
your <i>News Night</i> family at midnight.

26
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:58,760
Well, near them, anyway.

27
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:01,128
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yeah.

28
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:03,230
Can Wade have
two minutes with you?

29
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:05,499
He's got some facts
he wants to share.

30
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,501
- Sure.
- You don't mind?

31
00:03:07,535 --> 00:03:09,169
No problem.

32
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,108
<i>Wade?</i>

33
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:18,111
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

34
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:21,047
Oh, and Jim's putting together
the packet of stories you asked him to.

35
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:22,815
You want to give it five
minutes a night next week?

36
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,717
- Let's look at the stories first.
- Done.

37
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,885
I'll leave you guys alone.

38
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,289
- How have you been?
- I've been good, thanks.

39
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:33,458
- And I appreciate you taking a minute.
- What can I do for you?

40
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,861
You know I'm an assistant US attorney
for the southern district, right?

41
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,730
- Yeah.
- Well, right now,

42
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:40,932
my job's prosecuting
financial crime.

43
00:03:40,966 --> 00:03:43,434
Well, you know, Wade,
feel free to start any time.

44
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,469
You've been pretty rough on us.

45
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:47,971
Countrywide?
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

46
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,407
You've got guys flooding
the market with bad mortgages,

47
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:53,142
lying to investors,
making billions of dollars,

48
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:55,245
but most incredibly,
discussing it by email.

49
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:58,548
I don't mean to insult you, man,
but how do you not get a fraud conviction?

50
00:03:58,616 --> 00:04:01,183
Right there's what
I'm talking about.

51
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:04,420
This is the half of the story
you're leaving out.

52
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,889
- Are you ready for me to blow your mind?
- Gary: Sure.

53
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,391
- Bigfoot's real.
- Jim: No, it's not.

54
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,327
- Gary: Did you say--
- Bigfoot is real.

55
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,362
- No, it's not.
- Listen to me, skeptismo.

56
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,997
There are 1.7 million
known species on the planet,

57
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,366
and biologists estimate
this represents

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,965
only a quarter of the total
species on the planet.

59
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,399
The other three quarters
are microscopic.

60
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,265
- How do you know?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

61
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,265
But if the other three
quarters were Bigfoot,

62
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,801
they wouldn't be hard to see.
They'd be walking up and down the street.

63
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,037
We're gonna step
slowly away now.

64
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:32,140
Don't mention this to anyone
unless you know them really well.

65
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:35,944
- And even then.
- Pandas were thought to be a myth until 1869.

66
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:38,479
Gorillas were thought
to be a myth until 1902.

67
00:04:38,514 --> 00:04:41,915
The giant squid was thought
to be a myth until 2004.

68
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,484
- What's up?
- Maggie, listen to me.

69
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,753
Apex predators--
species at the top of the food chain--

70
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,623
have the smallest numbers
and move in the tiniest packs.

71
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:50,893
Is this Bigfoot?

72
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:53,696
Species diversity is greatest
in the rain forests.

73
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,298
Stop. Just don't even--
Stop.

74
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:58,533
What are you doing?

75
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,969
Trying to work.

76
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:04,238
- Do you see there's a party happening around you?
- I'm okay.

77
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:06,740
Sometimes it's hard to tell
who the biggest nerd in the office is.

78
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:11,411
- Could there be an apex predator primate--
- Not today, though.

79
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,313
Kaylee.

80
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:14,847
<i>You guys haven't met
Kaylee yet.</i>

81
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,281
Is this a new girlfriend?

82
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,884
- Girlfriend's a strong word.
- Really?

83
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:21,120
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

84
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:24,459
- Kaylee: <i>Get me drunk.</i>
- Neal: <i>Done.</i>

85
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,694
Boom!

86
00:05:28,764 --> 00:05:30,798
- Come on, join the party.
- I will.

87
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,467
I just want to finish
this for Will.

88
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,337
- What is it?
- Stories we missed this year

89
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:38,074
or didn't give
enough attention to.

90
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:40,243
- Want some help?
- Sure.

91
00:05:40,277 --> 00:05:43,113
Yeah, take this stack here

92
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:45,182
- <i>and anything you think is--</i>
<i>- Anything we missed.</i>

93
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,352
Jim: <i>Or didn't give
enough attention to.</i>

94
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:51,290
Bigfoot's real and
I don't think anyone reported it.

95
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:53,125
- Hey, Don.
- Jim: <i>Circle it.</i>

96
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:57,628
You look really nice tonight.

97
00:05:58,828 --> 00:06:02,194
- Yeah?
- God, definite-- Yes.

98
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,494
Yeah. Definitely.

99
00:06:04,528 --> 00:06:11,132
- Yeah, I don't mean to be--
- Shoot, Don's here.

100
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,801
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem. I was almost done.

101
00:06:13,835 --> 00:06:16,336
Well, don't, you know--

102
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,472
- Take a couple hours off.
- I will.

103
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:21,341
Will you?

104
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,909
'Cause it's a party.
Have you ever been to one?

105
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:26,946
I have been to
over three of them.

106
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,950
Maggie.

107
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:31,118
See you later.

108
00:06:38,726 --> 00:06:41,828
- Oh, man. Look at you.
- You look at me.

109
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:43,864
I had to get a crew off the clock.
Did I miss anything?

110
00:06:43,898 --> 00:06:47,834
Neal won't rest until
he gets Will to do a story on Bigfoot.

111
00:06:47,868 --> 00:06:49,135
Did Bigfoot do something?

112
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:50,636
Bigfoot can't do anything.
He's not real.

113
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,305
That's what they said
about the moon landing.

114
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:53,873
I believe you've
had a cocktail.

115
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:56,075
Men have cocktails.
Carrie Bradshaw has drinks.

116
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,610
Nope, the other way around.

117
00:06:57,645 --> 00:06:58,979
Doesn't matter.
I'm fun Don tonight.

118
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,914
I love fun Don.

119
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:02,916
- Where have I seen this dress before?
- On Lisa.

120
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,718
- She let me raid her closet.
- I think you should never take it off.

121
00:07:05,753 --> 00:07:07,286
Except when you take it off.

122
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,722
Now, speaking of your roommate,
I had a great idea.

123
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,124
- Soundproofing her bedroom?
- Fixing her up with Jim.

124
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,660
Are you kidding?

125
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:17,128
I feel like I owe him one.

126
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:21,332
Then why would you
unleash Lisa on him?

127
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:23,401
- They'll get along.
- She works in a boutique.

128
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,670
- Here she is. Lisa.
- Wait, don't.

129
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,104
This is the worst
fix-up ever.

130
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:29,273
I'm not talking about
having him take a bride.

131
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,775
- I'm talking about starting off the new year...
- Getting him laid.

132
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,212
- With a bang.
- ...with a bang. See what I did?

133
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,581
- You made it.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:39,250
Am I wearing a huge sign
that says dateless on New Year's Eve?

135
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,420
- No, but that dress sends a message loud and clear.
- Do I look slutty?

136
00:07:42,455 --> 00:07:44,322
- Absolutely. In the best way.
- No. Don!

137
00:07:44,357 --> 00:07:46,058
I wasn't going for slutty.
I was going for--

138
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:49,961
<i>♪ If you want my body and you think I'm sexy ♪</i>

139
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:53,231
<i>♪ Come on, sugar,
let me know. ♪</i>

140
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,966
I like Rod Stewart.

141
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,400
Yeah. So,
I've got a guy for you.

142
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,535
- No, you don't.
<i>- A guy here?</i>

143
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,603
- Yeah.
- No.

144
00:07:58,638 --> 00:07:59,838
Is it another loser

145
00:07:59,872 --> 00:08:01,206
that doesn't have a date
on New Year's Eve?

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,142
- He's not a loser.
- Yes, he's a huge loser.

147
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,812
- What the hell is going on?
- What the hell <i>is</i> going on?

148
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:10,215
She works in fashion, Don.
No offense, Lis.

149
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,284
<i>I don't even know what
I'm supposed to be offended by.</i>

150
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:14,186
But I can talk about other things.
I don't have to talk about fashion.

151
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,621
- I know you can.
<i>- Give me a topic.</i>

152
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,190
What's happening with
the Greek debt crisis?

153
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:19,728
There's a huge crisis
in Greece.

154
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:21,565
- They're in a lot of debt.
- See?

155
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,869
- Are you serious?
- That's more than most people know.

156
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,938
You see the guy over there?
The cute, sweet-looking puppy dog guy

157
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,474
- with the stupid look on his face?
- He is cute.

158
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,342
- Why is he working?
- He has a job.

159
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,245
So right there,
he's a leg up on your usual diet.

160
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,114
His name's Jim Harper.
He's a senior producer.

161
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:39,083
He's a bright guy.
He's not the creative director

162
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,519
for an imaginary Internet start-up.
He calls his mother.

163
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,888
I'm sure he's nice,
but I don't think I'm in the mood for a fix-up.

164
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,590
- Why not?
- I don't know, I'm just coming off a relationship.

165
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,326
Of 10 days. I've bought milk
before your relationship started

166
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,663
- that was still good to drink after it ended.
- I don't think so.

167
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:51,931
No, it's true.
I can show you the milk.

168
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,366
She doesn't need to be fixed up,
honey.

169
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,268
I didn't say that she
needed to be fixed up.

170
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,570
No guy wants to be fixed up
10 minutes before midnight.

171
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,306
Besides, I'm not his type.
I can tell.

172
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,842
You're everybody's type.
You're the girl next door. Let's go.

173
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,511
Next door to what?

174
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,314
- Jimmy Olsen.
- That nickname's really gonna stick, huh?

175
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,517
It has endured. It's a compliment.
Jimmy Olsen was a go-getter.

176
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,087
Yeah, but strictly speaking,
he was a photojournalist.

177
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,089
In fact, when DC Comics
first introduced--

178
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,725
Yeah, shut up.
This is Maggie's roommate Lisa.

179
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,594
Oh, hey.
It's nice to meet you.

180
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:22,462
- Nice to meet you, too.
- I've heard a lot about you.

181
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:24,131
I've heard a lot about--
Not a lot.

182
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:28,135
Maggie's--
She's mentioned you once, I think.

183
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,438
Lisa went to Parsons

184
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:32,440
and she works at a very high-end
boutique in the Village.

185
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:34,943
- Nice.
- So why don't you take Lisa out onto the terrace

186
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,911
where you can watch one million
people in Times Square

187
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,013
waiting for the world's
biggest nonevent?

188
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,149
<i>Maggie and I are going to get some drinks
and we'll meet you out there.</i>

189
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:43,785
- Jim has to work.
- Not at 11:50 on New Year's Eve.

190
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,887
Grab some coats.

191
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:47,522
- Tess.
- Yeah?

192
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:48,756
Kill me.
Kill me now.

193
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,825
- Do it now.
- Huh?

194
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,268
Congress cut our investigations
to 20% of what they promised.

195
00:09:56,302 --> 00:09:59,004
We were supposed
to get 165 million.

196
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,708
But after rolling over to the GOP,
they only gave us 30.

197
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:03,713
- How's it going in here?
- Good.

198
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:06,217
Wade says the House cut 80%
of the DOJ's budget

199
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,586
- to fight financial crime.
- He was just telling me.

200
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,322
For every one of me
the Justice Department can hire,

201
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:14,226
the banks can hire 20
and afford to stay in litigation forever.

202
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,462
You think Big Tobacco
throws money at this shit?

203
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,464
Meet Goldman.
Meet Lehman.

204
00:10:18,498 --> 00:10:21,333
Meet B of A.
And meet Countrywide.

205
00:10:21,368 --> 00:10:24,870
Honey, are you saying the United States
of America is getting out-lawyered?

206
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,872
Don't call him honey.
It makes me crazy.

207
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:30,509
I didn't say that.
It came out of my mouth. Just words.

208
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,745
Yes, we are getting
out-lawyered.

209
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,982
That is a story we're missing.
Let me talk to Mac a second.

210
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,383
- <i>All right?</i>
- Great.

211
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,185
- I'll be outside.
- Great.

212
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,627
You can't have your boyfriends
lobbying me to go easier on them.

213
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:50,663
Hang on, he wasn't lobbying for you to go easier.
He was pitching a story.

214
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:51,997
I've got a staff of paid
professionals to do that.

215
00:10:52,032 --> 00:10:53,966
Mostly by using
inside sources like Wade.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,468
And it's not boyfriends.
It's one boyfriend.

217
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:58,604
- So he's your boyfriend?
- I guess he is.

218
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,639
- <i>I mean, that's what you call him?</i>
- I call him Wade.

219
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:03,008
- When you introduce him, do you say--
- Yes!

220
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:06,378
How do you introduce the Netflix queue
of crazy divorced women

221
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:08,980
with digitally remastered breasts
you spend your nights with?

222
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:10,515
You see anyone
with me right now?

223
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:12,817
Of course not.
If you'd asked someone out on New Year's Eve,

224
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:14,652
that would mean you
were in a real relationship.

225
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,821
Oh, please. Please tell me more
about real relationships.

226
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,224
I'm not keeping myself
in jail anymore.

227
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,193
- What does that mean?
- He's my boyfriend.

228
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,128
We're serious.
I want a partner.

229
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:25,264
That is so romantic.
I'd set it to music.

230
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:28,267
- Look.
- I'm glad you're letting yourself out of jail.

231
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,769
- I meant--
- You owe it to yourself.

232
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,279
Congress defunded the DOJ
on financial crime.

233
00:11:40,314 --> 00:11:41,914
I thought you'd want
to hear that.

234
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:43,749
I did.

235
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,686
Come on out to the party.

236
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,788
I will.

237
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:52,260
All right.

238
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:17,451
Fuck it.

239
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,465
- Nice tux.
- I just came from a different party.

240
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,368
- Was it good?
- Have you ever been to a good New Year's Eve party?

241
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:37,039
- No.
- I've never enjoyed myself on December 31st.

242
00:12:37,073 --> 00:12:39,275
No one ever has.
I can tell you for me,

243
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:41,443
there was this one time
in 10th grade--

244
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,045
This is my thing
I'm talking about now.

245
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,681
Okay.
Why don't you talk to someone?

246
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:47,683
I don't need a therapist,
I just don't like New Year's Eve.

247
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:50,052
No, I'm saying

248
00:12:50,087 --> 00:12:53,055
why don't you go up to someone
here at the party and talk to them?

249
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,457
- Do people really do that?
- Talk to people?

250
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,993
- Just walk up to them.
- I've seen it on TV.

251
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,730
That woman over there,
she's obviously here alone

252
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:03,799
and I'm getting
a good feeling about her.

253
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,935
You have good instincts
about these things?

254
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,437
I'm opening up to you.
I'm not good at this.

255
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:11,006
That's really sweet, Will.
You should let more people--

256
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,376
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what do I do?

257
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,378
Walk up to her
and introduce yourself.

258
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,080
- I'm gonna do it.
- You should.

259
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,582
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Talk to her.

260
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:21,417
- I'm going.
- Okay, but you're still standing here.

261
00:13:21,451 --> 00:13:23,819
- Here I go.
- Haven't moved.

262
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:26,522
Shut up.

263
00:13:29,526 --> 00:13:32,095
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Am I in your way?

264
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:33,963
No, I just wanted
to introduce myself.

265
00:13:33,998 --> 00:13:36,432
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- I know that.

266
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm Nina Howard.

267
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:41,504
I don't know what to do now.

268
00:13:41,538 --> 00:13:45,407
- Did you come over to talk to me?
- Yes.

269
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:47,476
All right.

270
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,045
How'd you get in here?

271
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,248
I'm a friend of one of the producers
on <i>ACN Morning</i>.

272
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:54,516
Day side. Uh-oh.

273
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,018
Oh, day side and prime time
don't get along?

274
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,653
Jets and the Sharks.

275
00:13:58,688 --> 00:14:01,723
Well, maybe we could
be like Tony and Maria.

276
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,560
Why is Will talking
to Nina Howard?

277
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,430
- You know who she is?
- She's a gossip columnist for <i>TMI</i>.

278
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,165
Oh, he shouldn't be
talking to her.

279
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,534
- I know. Why is he?
- I may have suggested it.

280
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,403
- Why?
- You were here with Wade and he seemed lonely.

281
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,205
Excuse me.

282
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:19,074
- Hi.
- Hi.

283
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,375
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry.

284
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,277
- Can I talk to you a moment?
<i>- Really?</i>

285
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:24,846
- Yeah.
- She wants to warn you that I'm a gossip columnist.

286
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:27,949
Oh, that's not it.
I promise.

287
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:31,086
- She's a gossip columnist.
- No, she writes features.

288
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,422
<i>TMI</i> had Jennifer Aniston
on the cover this week.

289
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,891
You know who they had last week?
Jennifer Aniston.

290
00:14:35,926 --> 00:14:37,926
- Know who they had the week before?
- Are you a subscriber?

291
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,261
They have it at my nail place.

292
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,363
- Oh, do you go to Cuti-cles?
- Yes.

293
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:42,731
- Ba-Ling?
- Yes.

294
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,166
- I'm walking away from this.
- No, Will.

295
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,001
Yeah, my instincts
may have been wrong.

296
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,170
It's New Year's Eve.
I don't care if she writes for <i>Mein Kampf</i>.

297
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:53,275
Really?
You're setting up my boyfriend?

298
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,911
- Not my boyfriend. Just words. Hi.
- What about your boyfriend?

299
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:59,380
- Hey, handsome.
- Nice.

300
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:03,150
You know, it's only a few
minutes before midnight.

301
00:15:03,185 --> 00:15:05,153
Yeah, we've got
clocks everywhere.

302
00:15:05,187 --> 00:15:08,623
So I say you kiss me
at midnight

303
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,191
and we see what
happens from there.

304
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:13,194
I'm gonna start to walk
up to people more.

305
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:15,729
I got you a drink.

306
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,365
Now you seem lonely
and broken to me.

307
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,567
- I do?
- But don't worry, I can fix you.

308
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,569
Well, if there's one thing
a man likes,

309
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:24,805
it's a woman who tries
to fix him.

310
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,907
What are you
working on right now?

311
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,442
A piece on Brittany Giancarlo.

312
00:15:28,477 --> 00:15:30,611
I don't know who that is.

313
00:15:30,646 --> 00:15:33,014
Brittany Giancarlo.
She's the young one

314
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:34,749
on <i>Real Housewives of New Jersey</i>.

315
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:38,619
- Oh, I've got them all TiVo'd.
- She's a drunk gold digger

316
00:15:38,653 --> 00:15:40,722
who's probably cheating
with her yoga instructor.

317
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,557
And why are you
writing about her?

318
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,924
I just told you.

319
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,393
No, I mean, sure,
but what did she do?

320
00:15:46,428 --> 00:15:48,129
Nothing,
it's just a takedown piece.

321
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,931
- A what?
- A takedown piece.

322
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,666
I'm gonna take her down.

323
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,634
Why?

324
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,537
'Cause that's what you do
in a takedown piece, genius.

325
00:15:57,572 --> 00:15:59,506
Crowd:
<i>Nine, eight...</i>

326
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:02,543
You actually call it
a takedown piece?

327
00:16:02,577 --> 00:16:04,679
- Yeah.
- Crowd: Four, three,

328
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,347
two, one!

329
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,850
Happy New Year!

330
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:17,993
- Hang on.
- What?

331
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:21,063
You're just setting out
to be mean to somebody?

332
00:16:21,097 --> 00:16:23,665
- And this was going so well.
- No, it could still go well.

333
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,433
Not if you're going to give me
a condescending lecture.

334
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:26,835
I think we both know
that's what's going to happen.

335
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,837
Didn't I just spend
the last six months

336
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:30,605
watching you take
down the Tea Party?

337
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,040
Okay, first,
thanks for watching.

338
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,409
Second, I obviously didn't take them down.
They won.

339
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:37,846
Third, the fact that they did
is an enormous danger to A:

340
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,514
- a great political party...
- Oh, there's subheadings?

341
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,083
Of which I happen
to be a member, and B:

342
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,952
An enormous danger to everyone
who lives in this country.

343
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:45,220
- Fourth...
- Fourth?

344
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,823
These are people who
are asking for our votes.

345
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:51,893
You and I do the same
thing for a living.

346
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,862
That's nuts, Nina.

347
00:16:53,896 --> 00:16:57,399
I try to expose the truth about things
that are of national importance.

348
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,702
Well, I'm trying to expose
the truth about the fact

349
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,204
that Brittany might have had a daughter
when she was a teenager

350
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:05,174
who's now 10 possibly and being
taken care of by her mother.

351
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:06,976
Why is that the concern of
anyone except for Brittany?

352
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,979
It's not a concern.
It's entertainment.

353
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:12,548
Okay, well, here's the thing,
though, it shouldn't be.

354
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:14,183
- Is that right?
- Of course it's right.

355
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:16,018
You know it's right.
You know right from wrong.

356
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:17,619
Everybody said
you were like this.

357
00:17:17,654 --> 00:17:19,755
No, no, look.
You can be part of the change.

358
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,123
You don't have to write gossip.

359
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:22,991
I work for a gossip magazine.

360
00:17:23,026 --> 00:17:26,128
Are we gonna go back to flirting or
are you gonna keep putting me down?

361
00:17:26,163 --> 00:17:28,297
I'm not putting you down.
I'm just saying that what you do

362
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:30,766
is a really bad form of pollution
that makes us dumber

363
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:32,735
and meaner and is
destroying civilization.

364
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,271
I'm saying,
with all possible respect,

365
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:38,375
that I would have more respect for you
if you were a heroin dealer.

366
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,178
And I'm speaking professionally,
not personally.

367
00:17:43,448 --> 00:17:45,349
Okay, Will.

368
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:47,852
I'm speaking personally
when I say fuck you.

369
00:17:47,886 --> 00:17:50,955
And you just passed up
a sure thing.

370
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:52,623
- Come on, hear me out.
- Don't touch me.

371
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,792
The real lives of people shouldn't
be used as entertainment.

372
00:17:54,826 --> 00:17:55,927
- You can turn this around.
- I'm not interested.

373
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:57,728
What do you think he's doing?

374
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,263
Trying to civilize her.

375
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:02,300
Oh, that's not
gonna work out well.

376
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:05,136
Hang on, looks like
it's coming any second.

377
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,838
that you're on right now.

378
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:09,440
There it is.

379
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:15,346
- Will.
- Yeah?

380
00:18:15,381 --> 00:18:17,782
I just wanted to introduce
my friend Kaylee.

381
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,684
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you.

382
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,188
I hate to bother you,
but do you have a second?

383
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,823
I've got all the time
in the world, Neal.

384
00:18:24,857 --> 00:18:28,226
All right, Bigfoot is real.

385
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,362
- Let me start--
- Get the hell away from me.

386
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:33,432
- No problem. Sorry. Come on.
- Okay.

387
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,258
- Yeah?
- Have you read the <i>New York Post</i>?

388
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:02,194
No, my eyes
are connected to my brain.

389
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:04,496
I'm not sure about that.

390
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,532
Let's open to Page Six,

391
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,535
which for some reason
is on page 10,

392
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,870
and see what we find.

393
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:14,239
The headline, "Anchor Rancor."

394
00:19:14,273 --> 00:19:16,241
- Anchor anchor?
- Anchor Rancor.

395
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,043
- Anchor anchor.
- Rancor.

396
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:19,811
Anchor Rancor.

397
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:22,745
Subheader,
"Will McAvoy gropes in the New Year."

398
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:23,844
What?

399
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,845
"ACN's newly minted
liberal bloviator

400
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,180
made a scene at a private
New Year's Eve party

401
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:32,416
at which our spies caught
the reengineered lefty firebrand

402
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,053
making a drunken pass at
<i>TMI</i> reporter Nina Howard."

403
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:37,487
Whoa, Nelly!

404
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:40,756
"But the Tea Party foe
got a face full of bubbly

405
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,258
- instead of what he was looking for."
- Ha!

406
00:19:43,293 --> 00:19:46,494
"McAvoy was wearing
a $4,000 custom-made tuxedo

407
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,929
and a dumb look on his face."

408
00:19:47,963 --> 00:19:50,297
There are a couple of factual
errors in that story.

409
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,032
Please let there be
more than a couple.

410
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,066
First of all,
I'm a registered Republican.

411
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,501
I only seem liberal because
I believe that hurricanes

412
00:19:56,536 --> 00:19:58,903
are caused by high barometric
pressure and not gay marriage.

413
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,506
Second, I wasn't
making a pass at her.

414
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,574
I was rejecting a pass from her

415
00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:06,744
while trying to talk her out of doing
what they call at <i>TMI</i> a takedown piece

416
00:20:06,778 --> 00:20:08,412
of one of the
<i>Desperate Housewives of New Jersey</i>.

417
00:20:08,446 --> 00:20:09,980
- <i>Real Housewives</i>.
- Who gives a shit?

418
00:20:10,014 --> 00:20:12,081
- Definitely not me.
- And the tuxedo's off the rack.

419
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:15,250
- Did you grope her?
- No! I-I-I--

420
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:19,187
I gently touched her
to block her

421
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:20,989
as she was coming
in for a kiss.

422
00:20:21,023 --> 00:20:22,657
I blocked her.

423
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:25,493
I was the victim of
an unwanted sexual advance.

424
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,495
But more important,
I was fighting the good fight.

425
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,330
Why were you
fighting any fight?

426
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:31,398
I was trying to get her to
not write the takedown piece.

427
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,633
- Why?
- Why?

428
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,769
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you why.

429
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:36,771
Because I'm on a mission
to civilize.

430
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:38,973
- How's it going so far?
- Progress is slow,

431
00:20:39,007 --> 00:20:40,475
but I'm in it
for the long haul.

432
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:43,078
You want Publicity
to draft a statement?

433
00:20:43,112 --> 00:20:44,479
- About the mission?
- The Page Six piece.

434
00:20:44,513 --> 00:20:46,481
- Absolutely not.
- Good.

435
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:48,717
- What did you call me up here for?
- Mostly to laugh at you.

436
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:51,453
But I also wanted
to share an observation.

437
00:20:51,487 --> 00:20:53,055
- Go.
- You're dating.

438
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:55,624
I am. I've decided to live my life
as if I'm alive.

439
00:20:55,658 --> 00:20:57,392
I am all for it.

440
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,562
But I've noticed that the women you date
all have one thing in common.

441
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,430
I am a leg man.

442
00:21:02,465 --> 00:21:06,768
No, these are all women who,
in a million years,

443
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:08,970
you would not want to spend
any daylight hours with.

444
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:10,772
What do you make of that?

445
00:21:10,807 --> 00:21:12,875
You're asking out
the wrong women.

446
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,177
- I'm not an elitist.
- Be one.

447
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,148
No comment on this shit, Charlie.
I'm not kidding.

448
00:21:19,182 --> 00:21:21,985
And I'd also like to know who at my party
was tipping Page Six.

449
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,221
- I'll launch a full-scale investigation.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

450
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,290
How much was the tux?

451
00:21:27,324 --> 00:21:28,858
It was-- It was like--

452
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:31,027
It was 4,000 bucks.

453
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:41,237
Mackenzie: Now!

454
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:46,408
What's happening now?

455
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:50,480
In this order,
Tess, Tamara, Gary,

456
00:21:50,514 --> 00:21:53,783
Maggie, Kendra,
Martin, Neal, and Jim

457
00:21:53,818 --> 00:21:55,518
thought it would be funny.

458
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:58,221
- And you?
- Peer pressure.

459
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:00,623
I didn't grope anybody.

460
00:22:00,658 --> 00:22:03,493
I was holding her at bay
while I clarified--

461
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,562
It doesn't matter.
I'm on a mission to civilize.

462
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:07,664
- I'm Don Quixote.
- I'm Don Quixote.

463
00:22:07,698 --> 00:22:09,199
Have you even read <i>Don Quixote</i>?

464
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,568
- In the original French.
- It was written in Spanish.

465
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:14,003
Not my copy.
I could have read it in Spanish?

466
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:15,805
You could have read
it in English.

467
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,107
Well, there's a year and a half of my life
I'm not getting back.

468
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,810
Sit down.
All right.

469
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:24,380
Jim was working on New Year's Eve
on stories we either missed

470
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:26,816
or didn't pay enough
attention to in 2010.

471
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,586
Not all New Year's Eve.
He found some time to take a little break.

472
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,387
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

473
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:33,523
We'll do five minutes a night
every night this week.

474
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:36,392
I've boiled them down to these and, Will,
you can boil them down to what you want.

475
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,494
I'm out there on the front lines
fighting for civility.

476
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,896
You picked her up at a party.

477
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,031
I didn't pick her up.
I walked up--

478
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:44,100
And can I say in my defense,
did you see her legs?

479
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:45,502
All right, that'll do.

480
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,504
<i>First up, the Chilean miners.</i>

481
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,440
We stuck with the Christine O'Donnell
debate in Delaware

482
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:51,841
instead of cutting away
to the rescue.

483
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:54,077
I'll let everyone know
that they came out all right.

484
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,912
You're the one
who wanted these.

485
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:57,381
- Next?
- Next.

486
00:22:57,415 --> 00:22:59,717
I wouldn't mind following
up on the bribery charges

487
00:22:59,751 --> 00:23:01,752
- Nigeria filed against Cheney.
<i>- Next.</i>

488
00:23:01,787 --> 00:23:04,456
Conflict of interest with Virginia Thomas
and the voicemail message--

489
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,658
- Next.
- Tess?

490
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:08,694
- Now I'm frightened to say it.
- Say it.

491
00:23:08,728 --> 00:23:11,464
May 27, the iPad was released.

492
00:23:11,498 --> 00:23:12,765
Lines went around
the block--

493
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,634
- Get the hell out of the meeting.
- Yeah.

494
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:17,937
- Sit down.
- Where are the real ones? The lies. Lies.

495
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:21,143
Why doesn't the news ever call a lie a lie,
but we know it's a lie?

496
00:23:21,178 --> 00:23:23,181
Jim, Maggie.

497
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:26,818
It was during the week of the midterms
so we were doing other things,

498
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,655
but the idea that Obama
spent $200 million a day

499
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:31,557
on a trip to India
is still in the water supply.

500
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:33,625
We could deconstruct
how that happened.

501
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,827
Sold. What else?

502
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,228
- Maggie: <i>Guns.</i>
- Will: <i>What about them?</i>

503
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:38,531
Everyone from Wayne LaPierre
to Glenn Beck is shouting

504
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,099
that Obama is coming
to get our guns

505
00:23:40,134 --> 00:23:41,834
when there's no evidence
to suggest

506
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:43,903
that Obama's the least bit
interested in our guns.

507
00:23:43,938 --> 00:23:46,173
Show me the lack
of evidence and I'm in.

508
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:49,243
- Anything else?
- Yes.

509
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,615
I don't know
how else to say this.

510
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,917
- Bigfoot is--
- Great.

511
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:58,653
Not because they don't
want to limit your rights,

512
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,524
<i>but because they're afraid
of the political consequences.</i>

513
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:04,393
- Coming back to you, Will.
<i>- Don't doubt for a minute</i>

514
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,961
<i>that if they thought they
could get away with it,</i>

515
00:24:06,996 --> 00:24:10,432
- <i>they would ban guns and ban ammunition.</i>
- Stand by, 177.

516
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,101
That was former
governor Sarah Palin

517
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:15,538
speaking to the National
Rifle Association last year.

518
00:24:15,572 --> 00:24:17,873
Here's Fox News host Glenn Beck on
the same subject.

519
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:19,241
Herb:
<i>Go, 177.</i>

520
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:21,311
Beck:
<i>He will slowly but surely</i>

521
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:23,313
- <i>take away your gun.</i>
- Herb: <i>Stand by, 178.</i>

522
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:26,383
And here's NRA executive
vice president

523
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,851
Wayne LaPierre
speaking at CPAC,

524
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:30,087
- <i>the Conservative Political Action Conference.</i>
- Go, 178.

525
00:24:30,121 --> 00:24:34,324
But it's a big, fat,
stinking lie.

526
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:37,093
Just like all the other lies
that have come out

527
00:24:37,128 --> 00:24:40,430
of this corrupt administration.

528
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:43,566
Would you put
this guy on a list

529
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:46,036
of the top 10 craziest
people in politics?

530
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,771
That's a tough list to crack.

531
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:50,907
Yeah, I know this looks like a big,
juicy rib-eye to you,

532
00:24:50,941 --> 00:24:53,776
but show some restraint now
and let the facts speak for themselves.

533
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:57,380
- Any other tips?
- Try not to get distracted by his legs.

534
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,550
- <i>Here we go.</i>
- That's their agenda.

535
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,852
Will:
<i>And radio host Rush Limbaugh</i>

536
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:04,554
has repeatedly warned
to his listeners

537
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,091
to go out and buy guns before
President Obama outlaws them all.

538
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,660
The result?
In November 2008,

539
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:12,195
the month Mr. Obama
was elected,

540
00:25:12,229 --> 00:25:15,298
<i>there was a 42% spike
in gun background checks</i>

541
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:17,466
<i>as compared to the same month
the year before.</i>

542
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:20,102
- Stand by, G-17 through 22.
<i>- The country's largest anti-gun lobby</i>

543
00:25:20,137 --> 00:25:22,705
<i>is called the Brady Campaign
to Prevent Gun Violence,</i>

544
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:26,375
<i>named for James Brady,
President Reagan's press secretary</i>

545
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:28,276
<i>who was shot in the head
during John Hinckley's</i>

546
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:30,712
<i>assassination attempt
on the 40th president.</i>

547
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,948
The Brady Organization gives
grades to elected officials

548
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:37,335
based on their record and leadership
with regard to gun legislation

549
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,063
with an "A" being
the most anti-gun and so on.

550
00:25:40,097 --> 00:25:43,090
In spite of Governor Palin,
Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh,

551
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,151
and the Director of the NRA
telling us emphatically

552
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:49,079
that Barack Obama has
a secret plan to get our guns,

553
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:50,511
here's the president's
report card.

554
00:25:50,545 --> 00:25:54,069
<i>Background checks? F.
Gun trafficking? F.</i>

555
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,933
Guns in public? F.

556
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,430
Federal assault
weapons ban? F.

557
00:25:58,464 --> 00:26:01,658
Standing up to
the gun lobby? F.

558
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,186
Not only has no attempt
whatsoever been made

559
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,585
to dismantle
the Second Amendment

560
00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,045
<i>during Barack Obama's
first two years in office,</i>

561
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,676
<i>the president has signed
into law more repeals</i>

562
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,370
<i>of federal gun policies
than George W. Bush did</i>

563
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,300
<i>during his entire eight years
in the White House.</i>

564
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:18,696
In fact, these grades would
indicate that President Obama

565
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,085
is the best friend the NRA
has ever had in elected office,

566
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,882
<i>to say nothing
of the Oval Office.</i>

567
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,010
Why are Sarah Palin,
Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh,

568
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,138
and the head of the NRA
so colossally lying to you?

569
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:33,199
I don't know.
But I know when they do,

570
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:36,595
<i>ratings go up,
political contributions go up,</i>

571
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,022
<i>membership in the NRA goes up,</i>

572
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,486
<i>the president's
approval rating goes down,</i>

573
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,045
<i>and gun sales go through
the freaking roof.</i>

574
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,009
- <i>We'll be right back.</i>
- Herb: Cue music.

575
00:26:55,063 --> 00:26:58,223
You'll need to get used to dating
a guy who gets off work at 9:00.

576
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,554
Hey, not dating.
One date.

577
00:27:00,588 --> 00:27:02,517
- No, stop it.
- Maggie, I'm not--

578
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,979
- It's fine.
- It's not in the vicinity of fine.

579
00:27:04,014 --> 00:27:05,444
Listen to me.
This is crazy.

580
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,905
- I agree.
<i>- Nope, keep listening.</i>

581
00:27:07,939 --> 00:27:10,568
I have a boyfriend who I love.

582
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,496
And I should have fixed you up
with Jim a long time ago.

583
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:16,358
- Even if that were true--
- It is true.

584
00:27:16,392 --> 00:27:18,054
- Even if it was-- Even if--
- It is. It--

585
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:20,050
- Let me talk!
- Sorry.

586
00:27:22,081 --> 00:27:23,478
- He's--
- But it is.

587
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:25,441
He's gonna think I'm dumb.

588
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,097
No, he's not.
Who told you that?

589
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:34,291
No, he's not.
Lis', you're not dumb.

590
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:37,219
Look at me.
You're not dumb.

591
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:40,280
You go out with guys
who make you feel dumb.

592
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:41,676
And Jim's not like that.

593
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,173
That's one of the things
that makes him--

594
00:27:46,004 --> 00:27:49,561
Trust me. I've never been
on a date with him,

595
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:51,260
but I imagine...

596
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:53,821
You imagine what and how often?

597
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:55,918
That it would be fun...

598
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:57,681
is all I was gonna say.

599
00:27:57,715 --> 00:28:00,145
You're not dumb.

600
00:28:03,207 --> 00:28:04,736
I'm just nervous.

601
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,398
I know.
Your skirt's on backwards.

602
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:11,658
Damn it.
And this is my field of expertise.

603
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:13,655
Yeah.

604
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:25,306
Oh! Oh, my God. I'm freezing.

605
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,236
I've got a real fireplace
with real fire.

606
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:30,662
You do? Well, what about
some dry clothes I can change into?

607
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,361
<i>Take whatever you want
in the bedroom.</i>

608
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,291
<i>It's right around the corner.</i>

609
00:28:34,326 --> 00:28:36,686
Not the yellow
taffeta sundress.

610
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,850
This is your fault.

611
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:41,247
I'm not the one who said,
"Let's walk off dinner."

612
00:28:41,281 --> 00:28:43,709
I had to walk off dinner
because you made me order

613
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,773
the $135 macaroni and cheese.

614
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:49,500
I really wanted to see what $135 macaroni
and cheese looked like.

615
00:28:49,534 --> 00:28:51,797
- This is a fun date.
- It is.

616
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,927
And it's the same as
Stouffer's macaroni and cheese

617
00:28:53,962 --> 00:28:57,157
with $134 worth of
shaved truffles on top.

618
00:28:57,191 --> 00:29:00,616
<i>Sloan said you were fun.
Hey, do you like to get high?</i>

619
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:03,047
I used to,
but I can't buy pot anymore

620
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:04,810
without it showing up
in a newspaper.

621
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:07,340
<i>There's a joint in the side
pocket of my purse.</i>

622
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,435
<i>Get it out.</i>

623
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,465
All right.

624
00:29:24,547 --> 00:29:27,244
- Carrie?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

625
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,805
Can we talk about the gun
that's in your purse?

626
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:40,218
I'm a southern liberal, dude.

627
00:29:40,253 --> 00:29:43,055
It's northern liberals
who are afraid of sex and guns.

628
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:46,692
Well, both at the same time
and I'm a Republican from Nebraska.

629
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,661
But you mind if I...

630
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,735
You're disarming.
Get it?

631
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:57,271
- Here's the thing--
- Yeah, yeah, I saw the show tonight.

632
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:59,173
I'm a liberal's liberal.
I worked for Hillary.

633
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:01,642
- You were dead wrong on guns.
- I didn't take a position on guns.

634
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:04,212
I took a position on lying.
I came out against it.

635
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:06,747
Well, if I'm walking the streets of Manhattan
at night and a guy your size

636
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:09,184
wants to rape me,
then this is gonna happen.

637
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:12,086
Actually, statistics show
that this is gonna happen.

638
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:18,026
Is it wrong that
I'm turned on by that?

639
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:20,298
Yes.

640
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:22,500
What'd you think of her?

641
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:25,147
Yeah,
what'd you think of her, Will?

642
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,638
Oh, sorry.

643
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:29,441
- She was packing heat.
- Didn't I tell you?

644
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:31,043
No, Sloan, she was armed.

645
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:35,415
Waverly Inn
to my apartment

646
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:38,385
with a loaded .38 caliber
Walther PPK/S.

647
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,321
- Are you going out with her again?
- No.

648
00:30:41,355 --> 00:30:43,056
- Oh, you have to.
- No, I don't think so.

649
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,652
30 seconds.
Get your mics on.

650
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:48,007
No, she's gonna call me and call me
asking why you're not calling her.

651
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:50,276
That would happen after a second date,
too, wouldn't it?

652
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,944
Listen, just wait a while
before you show up

653
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,647
again in Page Six
with a different woman.

654
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:55,949
She's super jealous.
You haven't seen the crazy side of her.

655
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:58,251
You set me up with a crazy woman
who can shoot me.

656
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:00,020
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> with
a concealed carry permit.

657
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:02,389
- I'm tagging you back.
- That's totally fair.

658
00:31:02,423 --> 00:31:04,191
You're supposed to be
the smartest person on the staff.

659
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:06,660
- You have two PhDs.
- In Economics.

660
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,696
This is an area
where I do not excel.

661
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,763
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

662
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,832
Herb:
<i>In three, two...</i>

663
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:17,003
Will: <i>Terry Smith is coming up next
in Washington with the </i>Capitol Report<i>.</i>

664
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:19,306
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

665
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:26,714
Good show, everybody.

666
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,483
Good show.

667
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,919
Yeah, I don't know.

668
00:31:30,953 --> 00:31:34,389
The economy, we're still
nibbling around the edges.

669
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:37,593
We can't get it all
done in one night.

670
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:39,228
They're gonna rip Dodd-Frank
limb from limb.

671
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:41,931
I don't know how many more
nights we have left.

672
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:45,034
Hey, speaking--
Speaking of nights,

673
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,138
I never asked--
I forgot to ask you how your date went.

674
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,143
It went fine.

675
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:55,180
Do you think you'll
be seeing her again?

676
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:58,216
- I don't think so.
- Why?

677
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,852
Just one of those things.

678
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:02,354
Not a love connection?

679
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,828
Broccoli, and combine
cauliflower and string beans.

680
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:14,165
- So, elephant in the room.
- Yeah.

681
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,233
When I told my friend
I was going out with you tonight,

682
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,769
she sent me Monday's Page Six.

683
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:22,273
Okay, I met a woman
named Nina Howard

684
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,841
at our New Year's Eve party.

685
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,876
It turned out she writes for <i>TMI</i>.

686
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:27,511
I asked her what
she was working on,

687
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,547
and she told me she was doing
what she called a takedown story.

688
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:32,950
I'm on a mission to civilize,
so I tried to talk her

689
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,685
out of it and she
didn't take it well.

690
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,221
- A mission to civilize?
- I walk a lonely road.

691
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:40,291
What was the story she was doing?

692
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:45,362
Um, Brittany DiFranklengonio

693
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,996
from the New Jersey--
the Real Naked--

694
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,698
- Wait, Brittany Giancarlo?
- That sounds right.

695
00:32:48,732 --> 00:32:51,668
Yeah, she has a 10-year-old daughter
that she allegedly gave to her mother.

696
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,470
Shut up.

697
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,239
And they actually call it
a takedown piece.

698
00:32:57,274 --> 00:32:58,774
That is so typically Brittany.

699
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,443
Yeah, it is.

700
00:33:00,477 --> 00:33:01,878
She had a kid she gave up?

701
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:04,747
I have no idea.
I don't even know if the kid is real.

702
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,549
- What I'm talking about--
- I knew she was a liar

703
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,451
when she didn't invite
Wendy to her game night.

704
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,221
When she got busted,
she made everyone lie to cover her ass.

705
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,257
- What kind of person does that?
- I don't know.

706
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:16,493
Oh, and she's having an affair
with her yoga instructor.

707
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,296
- My therapist told me that.
- Your therapist really--

708
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,131
She knows I can keep a secret.

709
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,533
She's an awesome judge
of character.

710
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,901
- Brittany?
- Your therapist.

711
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,804
- 'Cause Brittany's a bitch.
- No, you are.

712
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,840
Okay, let's hold it right there
and review the situation

713
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:31,542
because when I said "you,"
what I meant was "we."

714
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,477
I meant I'm not
concerned about Brittany.

715
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,514
She signed up for this.
I'm concerned about the rest of us

716
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,984
who are being turned into a bunch of
old ladies with hair dryers on our heads

717
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,520
gorging ourselves
on the staged mis--

718
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44,822
It's just-- God,
it's so plainly bad, Monica.

719
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,490
It's called a guilty pleasure.

720
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,593
The chocolate soufflé on
this  menu is a guilty pleasure.

721
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:52,096
The Archies singing "Sugar, Sugar"
is a guilty pleasure.

722
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,433
Human cockfighting makes us
mean and desensitizes--

723
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,735
Wait, are you saying that
I'm mean and insensitive?

724
00:33:57,769 --> 00:33:59,771
You-- You are a smart,
accomplished woman.

725
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,874
- You work for a US Senator.
- Am I mean and insensitive?

726
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,376
Yes, but thank goodness
you met me in time.

727
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,278
Because now--

728
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:16,220
I can't believe
how often this is happening.

729
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,924
He said he wasn't
that into her.

730
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,092
Why are you so eager
to make this happen?

731
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,961
When did you get
interested in Jim's life?

732
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,496
Or Lisa's life?

733
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,865
I just asked
how did the date go.

734
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,135
But I'll tell you
what's strange.

735
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,670
- What?
- Jim's lying to you.

736
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:35,939
About what?

737
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,408
Lisa told me they were
going out again tonight.

738
00:34:38,442 --> 00:34:41,878
That's Lisa saying she's hoping
they go out again tonight.

739
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:43,646
- Ah, I misunderstood.
- Yeah.

740
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,380
Why would Jim lie about that?

741
00:34:45,415 --> 00:34:46,982
It's funny, I was
wondering the same thing.

742
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:48,617
Why don't you give him a call?

743
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,686
I'm not gonna call
and check up on him.

744
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,988
Then call him and tell him to
look on Politico 'cause I'm reading

745
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:55,156
that Spencer Bachus told
his hometown newspaper today

746
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:58,126
- that Washington is there to serve the banks.
- Seriously?

747
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,129
- Spencer Bachus is--
- I know. Is that a quote?

748
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:04,333
"Washington is here
to serve the banks."

749
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:07,803
I actually do have to call Jim.
It's an economic story.

750
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:09,905
That's what I'm saying.

751
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,679
Can I see that?

752
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,147
- Jim: <i>Hello.</i>
- Jim, it's me.

753
00:35:17,182 --> 00:35:18,715
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Did I wake you up?

754
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,484
<i>No.
Is everything all right?</i>

755
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,487
Go to Politico. The new Chairman of
the House Financial Services Committee

756
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,024
told his hometown newspaper
that Washington is here to serve the banks.

757

You know, I'll talk

764
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,619
Something wrong?

765
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,425
She should really
change her ringtone.

766
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:09,765
I can't believe
what you just did.

767
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:15,771
There is no way I'm the bad guy
in what just happened.

768
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,874
At worst, I'm in fourth place.

769
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,745
Have I done something wrong?

770
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,082
No.

771
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,386
Good.

772
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,091
- "Serial Sleaze."
- I can explain this one.

773
00:36:34,126 --> 00:36:36,994
"Will McAvoy is making more news
when he's not behind his desk.

774
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:39,297
For the second time in a week,
the ACN anchor

775
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:42,467
was humiliated by a drink to the face
from an unhappy date

776
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,837
- when the newly-come-liberal bachelor"--
- Registered Republican.

777
00:36:45,872 --> 00:36:48,607
--"stepped out with a bodacious blonde
for a late supper at the Mercer Kitchen.

778
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:52,545
The formerly vanilla host
of Atlantis Cable's flagship program,

779
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,714
who many believe
has become unglued

780
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:58,151
since an appearance at the Northwestern School
of Journalism last April,

781
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,353
seems to like the ladies.

782
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,957
Unfortunately for McAvoy,
the ladies don't seem to like him back.

783
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:06,827
The kicker?
Our spies tell us that McAvoy,

784
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:09,563
who's reported to earn
a mid-seven figure salary,

785
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:11,131
stiffed the waiter on his tip."

786
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:13,467
Are you kidding?
We didn't get past drinks.

787
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,235
I threw $100 on the table.

788
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,471
How much is a vodka martini
and a pomegranate cosmo?

789
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:19,606
Please tell me it was you
who ordered the martini.

790
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,041
Of course I was the one who--
Yes.

791
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:23,543
Look, she asked me about New Year's Eve,
I told her.

792
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:26,913
And it turns out that she, too,
really seems to care about the life of Bethany--

793
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:28,982
- Brittany.
- DiLaguardiosa.

794
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,984
- No.
- How does it get in the paper so fast?

795
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,452
God, these guys are good.

796
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:34,588
Well, now we're putting
out a statement.

797
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,156
- No.
- Not from you.

798
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:38,258
- From your spokesperson.
- Not from any person.

799
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:42,629
Mr. McAvoy has been the victim of
a comical series of misunderstandings.

800
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:45,165
No way. However,
I want to depose every waiter,

801
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:48,902
bartender, doorman, and valet
to whom I have ever given a tip.

802
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,236
That might be unrealistic.

803
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,538
I am beloved in
the service industries.

804
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:55,341
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you,
how's the dating going?

805
00:37:55,376 --> 00:37:56,876
You know what?

806
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,211
How many women did you date
before you finally found the one?

807
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,780
Doesn't matter
how many I dated before.

808
00:38:01,815 --> 00:38:03,783
I didn't date anyone after.

809
00:38:03,817 --> 00:38:05,919
It probably helped that
she didn't pull your heart out,

810
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:08,822
throw it into an oven
preheated to 450 degrees,

811
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,524
bake it in a light honey glaze,

812
00:38:10,558 --> 00:38:12,492
and serve it to you
on a bed of rice.

813
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,060
That's vivid.

814
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:16,296
But you don't hold onto things.

815
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,730
Why is it taking you so long to--

816
00:38:17,765 --> 00:38:19,199
Because it is.

817
00:38:19,233 --> 00:38:21,001
It doesn't work
like in the movies.

818
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,536
It doesn't work at all.

819
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,838
- How sure are you about that?
- Please.

820
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,341
On the off chance that you're
not going to live forever,

821
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,309
why not take a shot
at being happy now?

822
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:31,578
Can I go do the news?

823
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,714
Yes.

824
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:43,857
- Hey, stupid.
- Yeah?

825
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,959
- What'd I say?
- When?

826
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:49,229
I said don't show up in
Page Six with another date.

827
00:38:49,263 --> 00:38:51,798
- You think I phoned this in?
- Carrie is freaking out.

828
00:38:51,832 --> 00:38:53,166
- Who's Carrie?
- Two nights ago!

829
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,868
Oh, God.
What did she say?

830
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:57,103
That you're a womanizing asshole
and she hates you.

831
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:59,172
I wasn't womanizing.
I was dating.

832
00:38:59,206 --> 00:39:01,841
Well, William, she has a gun
and she's going to shoot you.

833
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,644
She's going to have to
shoot you first, Sloan,

834
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,212
because I'm going to use you
as a human shield

835
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:07,714
because you set me up
with Annie Oakley.

836
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:09,715
- You mean Ado Annie?
- I mean Annie Oakley.

837
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,784
<i>Annie Get Your Gun</i>.
Ado Annie's <i>Oklahoma</i>.

838
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:14,754
- "I'm just a Girl Who Can't Say No."
- I can't help you anymore.

839
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:16,889
Damn, 'cause your help's
been invaluable up till now.

840
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:19,391
Hey!

841
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:21,794
Are you sure about
<i>Annie Get Your Gun</i>?

842
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,428
Yes.

843
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:26,431
Back in 15 seconds, Will.

844
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,899
Try not to date anyone
before you're on the air.

845
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:31,203
Copy, Mac. Try not to sleep with your
ex-boyfriend while I am.

846
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:32,537
In three...

847
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:35,006
He got the better
of that exchange.

848
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:37,543
Mark Twain said a lie'll
get halfway around the world

849
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:40,145
before the truth has time
to pull its boots on.

850
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,880
That was literally the case
in this story

851
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,016
we didn't pay enough
attention to in 2010.

852
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,219
President Obama was scheduled
to travel to Mumbai

853
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:50,822
to meet with the Indian Prime Minister
about loosening US trade restrictions,

854
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:52,657
a successful trip
that would net our country

855
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:55,827
$10 billion in export deals
and 50,000 jobs.

856
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:58,963
<i>And these overseas trips
routinely cost in the area</i>

857
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,498
- <i>of $5 million a day.</i>
- Hey.

858
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,235
- Hey.
- But on November 2nd of last year,

859
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:06,906
the website for New Delhi TV
quoted an anonymous official

860
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,608
of the Maharashtra Government
saying that President Obama's

861
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:12,745
<i>trip would be costing
$200 million a day.</i>

862
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,415
The Drudge Report posts
a link to the story,

863
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,684
either believing it to be possible
or not caring that it isn't.

864
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,021
Rush Limbaugh knows this figure
can't possibly be right.

865
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:24,757
But Mr. Limbaugh
runs with it anyway.

866
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:27,393
507 rooms at the Taj Mahal,

867
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,695
40 airplanes,

868
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,265
$200 million a day

869
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:37,803
this nation will spend
on Obama's trip to India.

870
00:40:37,837 --> 00:40:41,808
In spite of there being no
source for this information,

871
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:44,043
to say nothing of
the absurdity of the figure,

872
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:47,279
- Fox News grabs the baton.
<i>- Ready, SOT 1.</i>

873
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,783
So he's traveling with 34 warships,
an entourage--

874
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:52,918
Oh, yeah,
and he added 34 warships,

875
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,887
or 14% of the US Navy.

876
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:57,690
So he's traveling
with 34 warships,

877
00:40:57,724 --> 00:41:01,027
an entourage
of 3,000 people--

878
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:02,228
Nope.

879
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:04,663
Beck: <i>He's staying at
the Taj Mahal Hotel,</i>

880
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:07,233
which they have booked
every single room in.

881
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,801
And he's doing it--

882
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:12,504
$2 billion for 10 days--
Why?

883
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:14,973
So on November 3rd,
Matt Lehrich

884
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,542
of the Office of White House
Media Affairs says,

885
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:21,780
"The numbers reported
in this article have no basis in reality."

886
00:41:21,814 --> 00:41:24,282
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann,

887
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,050
founder of
the Tea Party Caucus,

888
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:28,953
who herself has a difficult
relationship with reality,

889
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,455
ignores the statement
from the White House.

890
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,958
I think we know that
just within a day or so,

891
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,961
the President of the United States
will be taking a trip over to India

892
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,063
<i>that is expected
to cost the taxpayers</i>

893
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:41,632
<i>$200 million a day.</i>

894
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:44,435
I think people who willfully,
purposefully,

895
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:47,405
and gleefully lie
to the American people

896
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,641
in order to damage
someone's reputation

897
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:52,177
should, like
a registered sex offender,

898
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:55,680
be required by law to come
with that warning label

899
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:57,415
for the rest of their lives.

900
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:56,442
- Hello?
<i>- Will, it's Charlie.</i>

901
00:42:56,477 --> 00:42:58,077
<i>I'm sorry to call early
on a Saturday.</i>

902
00:42:58,111 --> 00:43:01,214
- What happened?
<i>- Can you come into the office at 11:00?</i>

903
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:04,284
- Yeah. What's going on?
<i>- I'll see you at 11:00.</i>

904
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:12,927
Welcome back to
<i>Red Carpet Roundup</i>

905
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:15,996
where we continue our review
of last night's fashion winners

906
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:18,399
and losers at
the People's Choice Awards.

907
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,801
We'll throw it back
to our studio in Hollywood

908
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:23,905
and Paulita Maya and her team
of fashion experts.

909
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:26,407
Paulita?

910
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:28,309
Man:
<i>And we're clear.</i>

911
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,398
He's here.

912
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:51,233
Against all instincts
of what sanity sounds like,

913
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,335
I'm here at 11:00
on a Saturday.

914
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,304
- Neal: <i>You won't regret it.</i>
- Jim: Too late.

915
00:43:55,338 --> 00:43:58,607
Thank you all for coming.
Let me begin.

916
00:43:58,641 --> 00:44:01,376
There are 1.7 million
known species.

917
00:44:01,411 --> 00:44:03,712
Biologists estimate
this represents

918
00:44:03,746 --> 00:44:06,915
only a quarter of the total
species on the planet.

919
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:10,452
Species diversity is greatest
in rain forests,

920
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:14,055
and 75% of all species
live in rain forests.

921
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,391
So, the argument is

922
00:44:16,426 --> 00:44:19,594
could there be
an apex predator primate,

923
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:23,264
a missing link if you will,
between six and 10 feet tall,

924
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:25,433
weighing up to 500 pounds
that lives in a dense

925
00:44:25,468 --> 00:44:27,602
temperate rain forest?

926
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,971
- Jim?
- No. Is that it?

927
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:32,006
Careful.
Sometimes when Jim says no,

928
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,208
what he really means is,
"I'm sleeping with your roommate."

929
00:44:35,277 --> 00:44:37,411
What's going on?

930
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,347
I didn't know you were coming.

931
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,948
- I was told to come.
- Really?

932
00:44:41,983 --> 00:44:43,684
<i>Charlie called me
at 7:00 this morning.</i>

933
00:44:43,718 --> 00:44:45,352
I wonder how that happened.

934
00:44:45,387 --> 00:44:47,788
Was I called in on
a Saturday for Bigfoot?

935
00:44:49,024 --> 00:44:50,891
I think you're gonna
find this interesting.

936
00:44:50,925 --> 00:44:52,926
I think you don't know
what that word means.

937
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:54,761
- What are you doing?
- You told me to come in.

938
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:56,329
Not for this.
What is this?

939
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,131
I'm glad you asked, Charlie.
Bigfoot is--

940
00:44:58,165 --> 00:44:59,899
Ah.
Follow me.

941
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:04,471
- I called you in for this.
- Oh, shit.

942
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,044
We need a whole team for this?

943
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:14,181
Don's a good advisor
on damage control.

944
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,983
- When's it come out?
- It's out. This is it.

945
00:45:16,017 --> 00:45:17,551
You keep guns in your house?

946
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:18,986
Yeah, a vast collection.

947
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,954
Sometimes to relax
I go to the park and shoot dogs.

948
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:22,623
- I'm just asking.
- She had the gun.

949
00:45:22,657 --> 00:45:24,458
Some crazy fucking
friend of Sloan's.

950
00:45:24,492 --> 00:45:26,360
<i>I took out the bullets.</i>

951
00:45:26,395 --> 00:45:28,529
The highest incidents
of Bigfoot sightings have all come

952
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:30,364
from the temperate rain forest
region that stretches

953
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:32,433
from Northern California
to Alaska.

954
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:35,904
Here we find local myths like
the Sasquatch and Ts'emekwes.

955
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:38,673
Here we find local myths
like Jim not being a liar.

956
00:45:38,707 --> 00:45:40,275
Come with me, please.

957
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:42,277
- I'm learning things.
- Now, please.

958
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:52,488
First of all, you can't talk to me like that
in front of the staff.

959
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:54,223
Oh, listen to Mr.--

960
00:45:54,257 --> 00:45:55,524
- Mike.
- Yeah?

961
00:45:55,558 --> 00:45:56,792
You got the rest
of the afternoon off.

962
00:45:56,826 --> 00:45:58,561
Maggie's taking your shift
on the assignment desk.

963
00:45:58,595 --> 00:45:59,762
- You sure?
- Go home.

964
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,130
Nice to throw
your weight around?

965
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:03,466
Yeah. Sit your ass
at that desk until 4:00.

966
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,668
That's number one.
Number two,

967
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:08,939
I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I didn't want you to be upset.

968
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:11,041
- Why did you think I'd be upset?
- Because you are!

969
00:46:11,076 --> 00:46:13,744
Not because you slept with Lisa,
because you lied about it!

970
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:16,514
Excuse me!
This isn't soundproof glass!

971
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,322
It is because
I slept with Lisa.

972
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,460
You've never lied to me in all the time
we've been working together.

973
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,728
Is that not a little bit--

974
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:34,098
Just a little bit
a good feeling?

975
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:37,301
That it feels weird
that I lied to you?

976
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:40,938
And isn't it a little bit
a good feeling

977
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:43,675
that my instinct was to lie?

978
00:46:45,144 --> 00:46:46,878
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

979
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:50,115
It was Don's idea to
fix me up with Lisa, right?

980
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,917
Maggie:
<i>Yes.</i>

981
00:46:51,952 --> 00:46:54,954
And Don was the one who called Lisa
when she was at my place?

982
00:46:56,456 --> 00:46:58,557
- Yes.
- Then I'd ask Don.

983
00:46:58,592 --> 00:47:00,792
'Cause he has every idea
what I'm talking about.

984
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:08,366
I'm sorry I lied.
It won't happen again.

985
00:47:19,813 --> 00:47:21,080
Don: <i>Did you know
she was married?</i>

986
00:47:21,114 --> 00:47:23,082
She's been separated
for over a year.

987
00:47:23,116 --> 00:47:24,750
- Did you smoke pot with her?
- Yes.

988
00:47:24,785 --> 00:47:27,453
Did you level
a .32 caliber gun at her head?

989
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,456
I was demonstrating--
Fuck this.

990
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,325
You'd just done
a gun rant that night.

991
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,693
Is that what it was, Mac?
It was a rant?

992
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:34,361
Don: <i>Does she have
a text message from you?</i>

993
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:36,830
Listen to me.
She got jealous 'cause she read

994
00:47:36,864 --> 00:47:38,898
that I went out with
someone else the next night.

995
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:41,134
Then she went to
Nina Howard at <i>TMI</i>,

996
00:47:41,169 --> 00:47:42,569
who was just waiting
for a chance--

997
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:44,305
I knocked Jennifer Aniston
off the cover?

998
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,942
This isn't funny, Will.
We're trying to do something here.

999
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:49,877
All of us.
There are guys in here

1000
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:51,813
on a Saturday doing--
What the hell are they doing?

1001
00:47:51,847 --> 00:47:53,314
They're learning about Bigfoot.

1002
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:55,450
Which, by the way,
is what used to be in the tabloids.

1003
00:47:55,484 --> 00:47:58,085
- Bigfoot and Elvis sightings have been replaced--
- Whatever.

1004
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,755
We signed up with you and
no one's going to hear a word we're saying.

1005
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:03,191
- Tell me what I did wrong?
- How about drugs?

1006
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,193
I took a hit of a joint
in my own home.

1007
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:07,295
- The text message.
- I'm not telling you what it says.

1008
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:09,030
<i>Just tell me if you'd want
your mother to read it.</i>

1009
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:11,332
Yeah, she died 10 years ago
and I wouldn't mind seeing her again.

1010
00:48:11,367 --> 00:48:14,302
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna go on <i>ACN Morning</i>.

1011
00:48:14,336 --> 00:48:17,305
<i>They are going to ask the questions we want them to ask</i>

1012
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,441
- <i>and you're going to give the answers we want--</i>
- I'm not doing that.

1013
00:48:19,475 --> 00:48:20,842
- Will.
- No, I'm not playing.

1014
00:48:20,877 --> 00:48:23,645
This is News Corp using
their gossip trash

1015
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,780
to fuck with an anchor.

1016
00:48:24,814 --> 00:48:27,683
News Corp doesn't own <i>TMI</i>.
We do.

1017
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:30,386
- I'm talking about the Right coming after me.
- Wait.

1018
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,957
- I'm talking about--
- Wait!

1019
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:40,997
Wait.

1020
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:44,234
The tuxedo.
The $4,000 tux.

1021
00:48:44,268 --> 00:48:45,869
You didn't buy it off the rack,
did you?

1022
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,470
- What does--
- Just tell me.

1023
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,779
You're my boss and I make
a lot more money than you do.

1024
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:56,548
That makes me uncomfortable.

1025
00:48:56,582 --> 00:48:59,551
- No, the tux was made for me by Armand--
- Armand Felini.

1026
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:01,219
Yeah, how did you know?

1027
00:49:01,253 --> 00:49:05,356
'Cause Leona Lansing gave me
the same Christmas present last year.

1028
00:49:05,391 --> 00:49:09,794
A custom-made tuxedo
from Armand Felini.

1029
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:12,530
This isn't News Corp.

1030
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:14,498
It's us.

1031
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:17,768
It's AWM.

1032
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:22,640
That's how Nina Howard
knew how much the suit cost.

1033
00:49:24,577 --> 00:49:26,210
Why would our parent company--

1034
00:49:26,245 --> 00:49:29,347
I had a meeting
I never told you guys about

1035
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:31,883
the day after election night.

1036
00:49:33,853 --> 00:49:37,122
Leona's really pissed that you're
shooting at Tea Party congressmen

1037
00:49:37,156 --> 00:49:40,358
and senators she has
to do business with.

1038
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:46,231
How pissed?

1039
00:49:47,733 --> 00:49:49,100
I'm not asking him to lie.

1040
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:51,169
I'm not asking him
to cover anything up.

1041
00:49:51,203 --> 00:49:54,239
But he's gonna tone it down
or I'll fire him.

1042
00:49:54,273 --> 00:49:57,075
Well, best of luck trying
to program against him.

1043
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:59,110
I won't have to.

1044
00:49:59,145 --> 00:50:01,312
He's got a non-compete clause
in his contract.

1045
00:50:01,346 --> 00:50:03,948
He's got to stay off television
for three years.

1046
00:50:03,982 --> 00:50:07,117
- That's a death sentence.
- It is.

1047
00:50:07,152 --> 00:50:10,287
How would you possibly
explain firing

1048
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:12,522
the second most
watched anchor on cable?

1049
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:15,758
By creating
what we call a context.

1050
00:50:15,793 --> 00:50:18,928
His firing would be viewed
as an honorable step

1051
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:22,998
by a corporation willing to sacrifice
ratings for integrity.

1052
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:25,434
How could you not
tell me about that meeting?

1053
00:50:25,468 --> 00:50:27,403
- I should have.
- You think?

1054
00:50:27,437 --> 00:50:30,439
- I should have.
- This is a huge line that's being crossed.

1055
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:32,074
- I made that clear to her.
- A huge--

1056
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:33,476
how many times
in the last six months

1057
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,511
have I asked if we're
all right on the 44th floor?

1058
00:50:35,546 --> 00:50:37,881
Will, I love you,
but you've got clay feet

1059
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,782
and I needed to
keep you in the chair.

1060
00:50:39,816 --> 00:50:40,983
Oh, thanks for the confidence.

1061
00:50:41,017 --> 00:50:42,451
Don: <i>Can we get back
to damage control?</i>

1062
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:45,720
- ACN Morning<i> Monday.</i>
- Hang on.

1063
00:50:45,755 --> 00:50:47,789
You'd never allow a non-compete clause
in your contract.

1064
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:50,292
<i>You couldn't stay off the television
for five minutes.</i>

1065
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:52,461
It got... put in.

1066
00:50:52,495 --> 00:50:54,563
<i>When?</i>

1067
00:50:57,166 --> 00:50:58,767
When, Will?

1068
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:03,805
When I renegotiated
my contract.

1069
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,007
To be able to fire me
at the end of each week.

1070
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,142
Yeah.

1071
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,187
Jesus Christ,
how much do you hate me?

1072
00:51:20,221 --> 00:51:23,658
- I don't hate you.
- You allowed a non-compete clause in your contract?

1073
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:27,095
<i>Three years? You were willing to stay
off TV for three years?</i>

1074
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,197
When was the last time an anchor
stayed off TV for three years

1075
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:31,198
and ever came back?

1076
00:51:31,233 --> 00:51:34,136
Have revenge sex with
every woman in the Tri-State area

1077
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:37,272
for all I care, but keep it out of
the goddamn newspapers.

1078
00:51:37,306 --> 00:51:40,274
- Some of us have moved on.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

1079
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:43,210
I can leave. You can do the
same show with another producer.

1080
00:51:43,245 --> 00:51:45,012
- We can have that discussion.
- Why don't we have it now?

1081
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:46,347
Yeah.

1082
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:49,250
Yeah, some of us moved on
three and a half years ago

1083
00:51:49,284 --> 00:51:50,685
and forgot to tell me!

1084
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:57,159
Neal:
<i>Uh, ahem.</i>

1085
00:51:57,193 --> 00:52:01,129
<i>The vast majority of this rain forest
is unexplored</i>

1086
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:04,066
<i>despite almost 100 years of commercial logging.</i>

1087
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:08,103
<i>I would add that renowned primatologist
Jane Goodall is also a believer,</i>

1088
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:11,273
<i>given the cryptozoological history
of the lowland gorilla.</i>

1089
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:13,375
<i>But she's not alone
in this scientific field.</i>

1090
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:15,577
<i>Due to frequent
yeti sightings...</i>

1091
00:52:25,154 --> 00:52:26,554
Heads up!

1092
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:30,525
- What's going on?
- All hands!

1093
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,594
There's been a shooting
in Tucson and a congresswoman,

1094
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:33,962
Gabrielle Giffords,
has been shot in the head.

1095
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:35,597
<i>This is Martin
at the ACN newsroom.</i>

1096
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:37,533
<i>I was wondering if you have
a comment on the shooting?</i>

1097
00:52:37,567 --> 00:52:39,735
- Get me our Tucson affiliate.
- It's Charlie Skinner.

1098
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:42,171
New York Control is
breaking in in 15 minutes.

1099
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:43,539
- Tess!
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1100
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,407
- I'm giving you a phone number.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1101
00:52:45,442 --> 00:52:48,411
Quickly.
Lt. Harvel Shansky,

1102
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:50,546
<i>Tucson PD. 8-4-6...</i>

1103
00:53:06,529 --> 00:53:08,564
Gary, I need to be able to talk

1104
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:10,299
to a goddamn correspondent
on the ground.

1105
00:53:10,333 --> 00:53:12,401
- The shooter's in custody.
- Who is he?

1106
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:14,203
How'd they get him?

1107
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:27,116
Everybody up!
Up, up!

1108
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,285
recording their
next album without Maines.

1109
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:32,221
We'll get the inside scoop
from Natalie herself.

1110
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,675
Will: We're cutting into our
program with breaking news.

1111
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:27,245
A local Tucson newspaper is reporting
that Arizona Congresswoman

1112
00:54:27,279 --> 00:54:29,681
Gabby-- Gabrielle Giffords
has been shot

1113
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:33,184
<i>while holding a public event
in Tucson outside a grocery store.</i>

1114
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:36,387
Possibly as many as 12 others
have been rushed to an area hospital...

1115
00:54:36,422 --> 00:54:40,124
We're now learning that three members
of Gabrielle Giffords' staff

1116
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:43,194
were among those wounded and rushed
to University Medical Center in Tucson.

1117
00:54:43,228 --> 00:54:45,029
Does he have an arrest record?

1118
00:54:45,063 --> 00:54:47,598
They've had him for over an hour now.
How can they not know who he is?

1119
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:49,766
He's not going on
the air with maybe.

1120
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,269
- Jim. Jim.
- No, an arrest record.

1121
00:54:52,304 --> 00:54:55,272
Okay, can you tell me if the congresswoman's
district office has received any threats?

1122
00:54:55,307 --> 00:54:58,075
Jim, NPR is saying she's dead.

1123
00:55:01,446 --> 00:55:03,414
- Anyone else?
- No.

1124
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:05,950
Then she's not dead yet.

1125
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:10,120
If you're just joining us,
a gunman in Arizona...

1126
00:55:10,155 --> 00:55:13,390
Fox, MSNBC,
and CNN are all calling it.

1127
00:55:13,424 --> 00:55:15,725
Let me hear MSNBC.

1128
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,994
Reporter:
<i>...a sole source of information</i>

1129
00:55:18,029 --> 00:55:21,030
<i>that reports that
the Arizona congresswoman</i>

1130
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:23,599
<i>Gabrielle Giffords
has been killed</i>

1131
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:26,869
<i>in this heinous attempt
on her life.</i>

1132
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:29,672
Joey.

1133
00:55:41,151 --> 00:55:43,853
Get me some official confirmation
or I'm not calling it right now.

1134
00:55:43,887 --> 00:55:46,723
Why hasn't he called it yet?

1135
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:48,992
I don't have time right now.

1136
00:55:49,026 --> 00:55:50,493
Jim, why hasn't he called it?

1137
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,762
- Gary, I need him in the hospital.
- He's there.

1138
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:54,864
CNN, MSNBC,
and FOX say she's dead.

1139
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:56,766
They're all going off
the same NPR report.

1140
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,868
- I'm not satisfied.
- I don't give a shit if you're satisfied.

1141
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:01,270
Mackenzie:
<i>What the hell is he-- Hey!</i>

1142
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:04,272
We're going to show you now an interview
Gabrielle Giffords gave just last year.

1143
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:06,040
This is Congresswoman Giffords.

1144
00:56:06,075 --> 00:56:07,776
- Herb: <i>30 seconds.</i>
- What's going on?

1145
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,345
- I'll call security.
- Every second you're not current,

1146
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:12,648
1,000 people are changing
the channel to the guy who is.

1147
00:56:12,682 --> 00:56:14,716
That's the business you're in.

1148
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:19,254
MSNBC, Fox, and CNN all say she's dead.
Don, tell him.

1149
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,358
<i>Don!</i>

1150
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:24,159
It's a person.

1151
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:27,329
A doctor pronouncers her dead,
not the news.

1152
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,678
Back in five, four...

1153
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:52,754
What we know so far is that
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords

1154
00:56:52,788 --> 00:56:55,457
and 12 others were shot
when a gunman opened fire

1155
00:56:55,491 --> 00:56:57,859
<i>at a local town hall
in Tucson, Arizona.</i>

1156
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,068
Is he overhearing it
or is he at the hospital?

1157
00:57:07,102 --> 00:57:09,304
- She's alive!
- Who's telling you that?

1158
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,206
The anesthesiologist.
She's being prepped for surgery.

1159
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,842
- I've got her alive!
- NPR called it wrong. She's alive.

1160
00:57:13,876 --> 00:57:15,911
She's alive.

1161
00:57:15,945 --> 00:57:17,479
Will.

1162
00:57:18,481 --> 00:57:19,647
All right, we're learning now

1163
00:57:19,682 --> 00:57:21,448
that Giffords is being
prepped for surgery

1164
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,552
<i>and we have our ACN affiliate
at University Hospital now.</i>

1165
00:57:24,586 --> 00:57:26,620
- What can you tell us?
- Will...

1166
00:57:26,654 --> 00:57:28,488
Mac, get in here
with Charlie right now.

1167
00:57:28,523 --> 00:57:30,590
- Is everything--
- Right now!

1168
00:57:41,535 --> 00:57:44,236
You tell Leona that if she
wants me out of this chair,

1169
00:57:44,271 --> 00:57:46,071
she better bring more
than just a couple of guys.

1170
00:57:46,106 --> 00:57:47,639
That's exactly what
I'll fucking tell her.

1171
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:49,008
I'm not fucking around, Charlie!

1172
00:57:49,042 --> 00:57:50,476
Feet of fucking steel.

1173
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:51,844
- Mac.
- I'm sorry.

1174
00:57:51,878 --> 00:57:53,780
- It's not your fault.
- I fucked everything up!

1175
00:57:53,814 --> 00:57:56,349
- It's gonna be all right.
- What the fuck is going on?

1176
00:57:56,383 --> 00:57:57,951
You're a fucking newsman, Don!

1177
00:57:57,985 --> 00:58:00,786
I ever tell you otherwise,
you punch me in the face!

1178
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,556
Okay, but you're back in 30.

1179
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:06,259
Back in 30.

1180
00:58:09,162 --> 00:58:11,631
Joey.
Just breathe regular.

1181
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:30,617
This is a sketchy description
of the procedure they'll be trying.

1182
00:58:30,651 --> 00:58:32,719
Hey.
When this is over,

1183
00:58:32,753 --> 00:58:34,320
let me see the Bigfoot
presentation.

1184
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:35,889
Really?

1185
00:58:35,923 --> 00:58:39,359
I think I need some consulting
on what's real and what's not.

1186
00:58:39,393 --> 00:58:42,195
Okay, I think you'll find that there's
some striking evidence--

1187
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:43,797
- Not now.
- Herb: <i>Stand by, camera 1.</i>

1188
00:58:43,831 --> 00:58:46,033
- Right.
<i>- In three, two...</i>

1189
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,768
Thank you, Tom.
Let's put together what we know.

1190
00:58:48,803 --> 00:58:52,272
A little after noon today,
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords

1191
00:58:52,306 --> 00:58:54,207
was shot while holding
a town hall meeting

1192
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:57,711
in Tucson, Arizona.
Along with Giffords...
