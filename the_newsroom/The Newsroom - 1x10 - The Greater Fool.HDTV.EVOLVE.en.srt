1
00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:03,026
You're trying to get me to write this story
without your fingerprints on it.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,597
Leona wants you fired.
She's hoping the tabloid stories

3
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,070
build to a critical mass
or that your ratings tank.

4
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,346
You don't want to do this.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,819
I don't.
But I have to and I will.

6
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,858
<i>They were delivered
for you this morning.</i>

7
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,896
- Jim signed for them?
- He said Maggie didn't see.

8
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,834
- "Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."
- I'm gonna.

9
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,871
- Hi.
- I wanted to talk to--

10
00:00:21,906 --> 00:00:23,141
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Don.

11
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,177
<i>You don't have to pitch me.</i>

12
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:26,512
Lisa wasn't the one
he came here to see.

13
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:29,016
<i>TMI</i> is doing phone
and computer hacking

14
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,351
and Reese Lansing knows?

15
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:32,254
Reese has been ordering it.

16
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,824
What do you have on
the NSA source?

17
00:00:33,858 --> 00:00:35,826
They've lowered his
security clearance

18
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,827
and he was arrested
for solicitation in 1979.

19
00:00:37,862 --> 00:00:39,462
If you had this guy
on the witness stand--

20
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,130
I wouldn't put him
on a witness stand.

21
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,899
<i>We're not agreeing to this
format and I don't want</i>

22
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:44,634
Mackenzie McHale
producing it for you.

23
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,937
- Get out.
- Will's a lonely guy, isn't he?

24
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:48,941
He doesn't care about
ratings because of the money.

25
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:51,879
He cares about ratings because
the audience makes him feel less lonely.

26
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:54,984
What do you plan on writing about,
Brian?

27
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:26,423
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

28
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:33,369
<i>And rolling.</i>

29
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:44,148
<i>Stand by, camera one.</i>

30
00:02:44,182 --> 00:02:47,084
<i>In three, two...</i>

31
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,919
Good evening.
I'm Will McAvoy.

32
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:50,454
This is Monday, August 8th.

33
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,790
And this past Friday,
for the first time ever,

34
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:56,327
Standard and Poor has downgraded
the credit rating of the US Treasury.

35
00:02:56,362 --> 00:02:58,663
You would think that would be
tonight's top story,

36
00:02:58,697 --> 00:03:01,032
<i>or you might think
that it would be the Dow</i>

37
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:03,101
<i>closing 634 points down</i>

38
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,270
<i>on its worst day of trading
in three years,</i>

39
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:07,205
or the austerity riots in Europe

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,143
or any of the statements made today
by the Republican candidates for president

41
00:03:11,177 --> 00:03:13,779
or statements made
by the president himself,

42
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,615
but it's not.

43
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:19,185
Tonight's top story is
a woman named Dorothy Cooper.

44
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:26,226
Will?

45
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:30,062
Will, it's Mackenzie.

46
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:32,331
I saw him come in,
but I didn't see him leave.

47
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,368
- I've been on for six hours.
- Will?

48
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,672
Will?

49
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:42,774
Hello?

50
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,284
He's not here.

51
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:57,120
<i>Will?</i>

52
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,124
- Did you try calling his--
- Hold on.

53
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:25,474
- Billy! Billy!
<i>- Oh, Jesus.</i>

54
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,346
I need an ambulance right away.

55
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,851
He's out of immediate danger,

56
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,719
but we're going to have
to stop the internal bleeding.

57
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:39,488
What happened?
Why was he coughing up blood?

58
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:42,290
He wasn't coughing up blood.
He was vomiting blood from his stomach.

59
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,392
There's upper GI bleeding,
probably a perforation.

60
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,993
You're describing a bleeding ulcer.

61
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:47,661
Yes.
We're prepping him for an EGD.

62
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,162
I don't know what that is.

63
00:04:49,197 --> 00:04:51,398
They're gonna put a tube
with a camera down his throat.

64
00:04:51,432 --> 00:04:53,032
Does he take any pain medication?

65
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,134
Hardly ever.
It's called, um...

66
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:56,869
- Naproxen.
- Okay.

67
00:04:56,903 --> 00:05:00,038
He hurt himself playing baseball
in high school-- His elbow and his knee.

68
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:02,507
- His right elbow and his left knee.
- What about antidepressants?

69
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:04,075
- No.
- Yes.

70
00:05:04,109 --> 00:05:06,444
He takes 135 milligrams
a day of Effexor.

71
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,412
Since when?

72
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:10,547
- I gotta keep some confidentiality--
- No, not anymore.

73
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:12,383
When did he start
taking antidepressants?

74
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:15,085
Has he been particularly depressed
about anything recently?

75
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:16,786
- Yes.
- Yes.

76
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,556
A magazine article, a hatchet job
that mocked everything we've been--

77
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,692
It was humiliating and
he's taken it very personally.

78
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:25,694
Okay, I think he's been
self-medicating.

79
00:05:25,728 --> 00:05:27,963
One of the possible
side-effects of Naproxen

80
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:29,064
is a decrease in the prostaglandin

81
00:05:29,098 --> 00:05:31,399
which protects the stomach lining
from its own acid.

82
00:05:31,434 --> 00:05:33,802
He knows that. That's why he hardly ever takes it.
Why would he take so much--

83
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:35,904
To get rid of the migraine headache
that comes with taking

84
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:39,240
too much Effexor and bourbon
at the same time.

85
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,943
He took too many antidepressants?

86
00:05:40,977 --> 00:05:43,612
I can't say for sure, but--

87
00:05:43,646 --> 00:05:45,647
Yeah, I can say for sure.

88
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:48,950
We'll be keeping him here
for a little while.

89
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,223
Dorothy Cooper is a 96-year-old resident
of Chattanooga, Tennessee,

90
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,993
and has been voting
for the last 75 years.

91
00:05:58,027 --> 00:06:00,662
This year,
she's been told she can't.

92
00:06:00,696 --> 00:06:03,164
A new law in Tennessee
requires residents to show

93
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,568
a government-issued photo ID
in order to vote.

94
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:09,003
Dorothy Cooper doesn't have
a driver's license

95
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:10,972
because Dorothy Cooper
doesn't have a car.

96
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:13,475
Dorothy Cooper doesn't
have a passport.

97
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:16,044
A vacation abroad
was never in her future.

98
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,413
Tennessee isn't alone.

99
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:21,116
At this moment,
33 states have proposed

100
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,952
<i>or already adopted
the same voter ID laws</i>

101
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:25,921
that have disqualified Dorothy Cooper

102
00:06:25,956 --> 00:06:29,057
from the one fundamental thing
that we all do as Americans.

103
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:33,095
It's estimated that 11%,
or roughly 20 million people,

104
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,664
don't have
government-issued voter IDs

105
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:38,567
and will be disenfranchised this November.
Why?

106
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,270
To crack down on the terrible
problem of voter fraud.

107
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:43,873
- Roll five.
- Governor Rick Perry of Texas,

108
00:06:43,907 --> 00:06:46,008
who is about to enter
the presidential primary race,

109
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,177
is serious about cracking down
on the problem.

110
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:51,347
Making sure that there's not fraud,
making sure that--

111
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:54,984
That someone's not
manipulating that process

112
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:57,853
<i>makes all the sense
in the world to me.</i>

113
00:06:57,888 --> 00:07:00,423
To me, too, because voter fraud
is such a huge problem

114
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:03,192
that during a five-year period
under the Bush Administration

115
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:05,394
<i>when 196 million votes
were cast,</i>

116
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:10,600
the number of cases
of voter fraud reached 86.

117
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:13,636
Not 86,000.
86.

118
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,206
Here's what that number looks like
as a percentage of votes cast--

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,975
<i>4/100,000ths of a percent.</i>

120
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,579
<i>This would be called a solution
without a problem, but it's not.</i>

121
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:26,916
It's just a solution
to a different problem.

122
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:29,752
Republicans have a hard time
getting certain people to vote for them,

123
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,754
so life would be a lot easier
if certain people

124
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:33,990
just weren't allowed to vote at all.

125
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:37,527
I'm ashamed to say that
32 of the 33 voter ID laws

126
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:39,529
were proposed
by Republican legislators

127
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:42,565
and passed by
Republican-controlled state houses

128
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:45,068
and signed into law
by Republican governors.

129
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:47,170
I am not, however,
ashamed to say

130
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,972
that I am a Republican.

131
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:51,676
And that brings us
to tonight's second story.

132
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:58,049
Austerity riots in London
and the FAA shutdown.

133
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,417
Mitch McConnell said

134
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:01,452
the debt deal was
a "hostage worth taking."

135
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:02,821
- That's a quote?
- We're checking.

136
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:05,323
As of about 10 minutes ago,
the Dow's down below 12,000.

137
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,827
There's a new investigation into
why the Interior Department

138
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,628
hasn't collected billions in oil royalties.

139
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:11,063
Robert Bork is now a Romney advisor.

140
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:12,532
We'll get this all sorted out.

141
00:08:12,566 --> 00:08:16,269
But let me ask-- Is anybody here
an expert on <i>Sex in the City</i>?

142
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,238
The TV show or just--
The TV show.

143
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:21,241
- Mother of Moses.
- Listen, she goes out of her way

144
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,543
to take an interest in my interests
and I wanna do the same.

145
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:24,844
- And she loves--
- I know what she loves.

146
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,680
- So I need a crash course.
- They have tours.

147
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,049
- What do you mean?
- They have <i>Sex in the City</i> tours--

148
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,752
Open-air buses that drive around
the West Village

149
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:35,822
and go to all the locations
and shoe stores in the show.

150
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:38,791
The buses are filled with women
who know every line from every episode.

151
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,360
- It's three hours.
- Three hours?

152
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,095
If you really wanna make Lisa happy,

153
00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:44,264
you'll go to <i>Sex in the City</i> school

154
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:45,465
<i>and take the tour.</i>

155
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,033
I don't know if I wanna
make her that happy.

156
00:08:47,067 --> 00:08:50,603
Let's start with McConnell
and the hostage worth taking.

157
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,551
You were sleeping for a while.

158
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,221
Yeah.

159
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,958
That's good.
You need to rest.

160
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,594
Yeah.

161
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,673
- Why did you do this?!
- Hey!

162
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,142
- What is wrong with you?!
- Stop hitting me!

163
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,212
- I've been waiting two days to hit you.
- I appreciate your patience.

164
00:09:31,246 --> 00:09:34,249
I don't want
your wise-ass remarks.

165
00:09:41,825 --> 00:09:44,694
You have to stop
being so sad about this.

166
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:46,262
I'm not sad about it.
I'm over it.

167
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:49,665
Uh-huh. That's why you suddenly
took antidepressants.

168
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:51,667
You got bad press.

169
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:54,103
It's not the first time.
It's not even the thousandth.

170
00:09:54,137 --> 00:09:56,271
- Did you bring Jane up from Washington?
- Yes.

171
00:09:56,306 --> 00:09:58,674
- You should go back and work.
- Jim's got it for a few hours.

172
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,476
- Tell me how this--
- Jane needs you.

173
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,712
Jim's got it.
Why is this story different from--

174
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:05,014
- It just is.
- That's a child's answer.

175
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,483
- Did you read it?
- Of course I read it.

176
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:09,519
It was a hatchet job
from my idiot ex-boyfriend.

177
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,987
You've gotten them before.

178
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:13,089
You've gotten them
from him before.

179
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:15,258
It isn't worth
the weeks you've spent--

180
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,061
It's almost--
It's two weeks you've been sliding--

181
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:19,629
- "The Greater Fool."
- I read it.

182
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:23,098
"One CNN producer remarked,
'lt's as though McAvoy is unaware

183
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,634
of how ridiculous he looks
doing what he thinks passes

184
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,903
- as a Murrow impersonation.'"
- Will, I know what it says.

185
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:31,740
"A senior VP at parent company AWM
laughed as he said,

186
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,242
'Will wants to change the world
and hates that the world has changed.'"

187
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:36,879
- You know it by heart.
- "It's not so much Will McAvoy is old..."

188
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:39,581
- Okay, this is really weird.
- "It's that he is antiquated.

189
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:42,251
His premise is irrelevant
and pompous."

190
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,420
- And why do you care this much?
- The greater fool.

191
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:46,990
- Why do you care this much?
- Because they're right!

192
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:48,591
Easy.
And, no, they're not.

193
00:10:48,626 --> 00:10:50,961
- They're right. He's right.
- Being a cynic is easy.

194
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,629
- What's difficult--
- Reality isn't.

195
00:10:52,663 --> 00:10:54,832
Trust me, this piece
was right about everything.

196
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:57,034
Stop. Enough.
It's been two weeks.

197
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:59,537
- Get up off the damn mat.
- You wanted Don Quixote?

198
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:00,871
- Oh.
- This is it.

199
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:03,007
By the way,
this is what brought him down.

200
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,877
- Nobody's brought you down.
- The Knight of the Mirrors.

201
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,545
He holds up a mirror and shows him.

202
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,813
- Stop it.
<i>- Shows him!</i>

203
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,181
I mean, he doesn't
fight him with a sword.

204
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,482
He shows him with a mirror

205
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,751
<i>what a total fool
he looks like.</i>

206
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:17,088
Brian was the Knight of the Mirrors,
and that's the chapter we're up to.

207
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:18,656
Nobody's brought you down.

208
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,760
You'll get back in your chair,
the red light will go on,

209
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:23,962
and you'll go to that place
you go every time--

210
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:26,131
I don't think I'm coming back.

211
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:35,173
I don't think I am.

212
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:44,182
You're coming back if I have to chop you up,
put you in a duffle bag,

213
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:45,917
and reassemble you
at the anchor desk.

214
00:11:52,358 --> 00:11:54,393
- You should answer that.
- You're coming back.

215
00:11:54,427 --> 00:11:58,464
Could be the office.

216
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,278
This is Mackenzie.

217
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:16,015
Why did you want to meet me?

218
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,951
I have a story I don't wanna write.

219
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,953
- Then don't write it.
- I have one source.

220
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:22,489
And if I get a second one,
I'll have to.

221
00:12:22,523 --> 00:12:24,257
What is it?

222
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:28,062
The night of May 1st,
the night we got bin Laden--

223
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,499
Was Will high on the air?

224
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:37,071
- Was he high--
- Was he high on the air?

225
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:38,939
- Who the hell told you that?
- My first source.

226
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:41,375
- You got lied to.
- I didn't.

227
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:42,643
Nina, you got lied to.

228
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:45,012
No. I promise,
it's an unimpeachable source.

229
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,981
And if I get a second one--

230
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:48,816
God damn it, Nina,
this is a complete lie.

231
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,418
No, listen to me.
I'm trying to help you.

232
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,288
- How?
- By telling you.

233
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:57,324
If I find a second source,
I have to go to press right away.

234
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,560
- And you're giving me a heads-up?
- Yeah.

235
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:01,662
Why?

236
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,764
Because I am.

237
00:13:07,235 --> 00:13:10,871
You can understand
my reluctance to trust you.

238
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,306
I understand everyone's
reluctance to trust me.

239
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:16,143
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I can't.

240
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:22,816
I don't like some of the things
that I've done to Will and to you.

241
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:27,020
I don't like some of the things
I've done to a lot of people.

242
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,556
Sorry, I don't believe you, Nina.

243
00:13:31,192 --> 00:13:33,994
When you were little,
what did you wanna do when you grew up?

244
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:35,829
Exactly what I'm doing.

245
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,831
I wanted to do exactly
what you're doing, too.

246
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:39,599
There's no such thing
as a little girl

247
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:42,801
who dreams of being
a gossip columnist one day.

248
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:46,205
I am trying to make some changes,
but I'm caught in the middle of--

249
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,575
You want me to feel sorry for you?

250
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,112
No. No, I don't.

251
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:56,549
Then what am
I supposed to do with that?

252
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:59,251
Make sure
I don't find a second source.

253
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:02,121
Keep walking.
I'm gonna cross the street.

254
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:06,291
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is.

255
00:14:06,326 --> 00:14:09,028
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,964
Obviously he didn't know he was gonna
have to be on the air later that night.

257
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:14,199
- He was high for bin Laden?
- Yeah.

258
00:14:14,234 --> 00:14:16,235
- But he killed it that night.
- I don't know what to tell you.

259
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:17,936
- He's a savant.
- Who else knew?

260
00:14:18,004 --> 00:14:19,872
Neal, Neal's girlfriend Kaylee,

261
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:22,274
- maybe some of the others--
- There's no way they went to Nina.

262
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:26,279
- I already spoke to them.
- I don't even need to. There's no way.

263
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:27,914
<i>This is it, right?</i>

264
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:31,518
This is what Reese and Leona
will use to fire Will.

265
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:33,420
Yeah.

266
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:37,390
- So what are they waiting for?
- A second source.

267
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:39,092
- Why?
- I'd need two sources.

268
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,460
You're not <i>TMI</i>.

269
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:43,563
I've never seen Will this down.

270
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:45,164
He's talking about
not coming back.

271
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,801
He's coming back.
Don't lose hope.

272
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,703
- I gotta go meet a guy.
- Hancock?

273
00:14:51,738 --> 00:14:53,638
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- What are you gonna tell him?

274
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,141
The truth.

275
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,842
Why?

276
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,811
You're not a credible witness.

277
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:02,380
35 years at the NSA
doesn't make me a credible witness?

278
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:04,882
Why did they downgrade
your security clearance?

279
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,284
They didn't downgrade
my security clearance.

280
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,919
- They did.
- They didn't.

281
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:09,521
I have reporters, Solomon.

282
00:15:09,555 --> 00:15:12,357
We have pages
from your CSS file.

283
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,359
He was given--
The reporter--

284
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:17,295
He was--
He was just given those pages, right?

285
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,064
- He was just handed--
- All he had to do was ask--

286
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,932
- He was given them?
- Yes, he was.

287
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,567
- Retaliation.
- Solomon--

288
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,437
Retaliation for raising the hue and cry
about GLOBALCLARITY.

289
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,839
Listen. Look at me.
I respect you.

290
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,874
I respect what
you're trying to do.

291
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,110
Nothing's harder
than doing something

292
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:34,145
for which you know
you're gonna take shit.

293
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,380
Then why won't you just--

294
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:38,249
Because if you're
the face of the story,

295
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,652
you'll contaminate it.

296
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:52,164
Do you like beef stew?

297
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,799
- Beef stew?
- You like it?

298
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,367
I guess.
I don't know.

299
00:15:55,401 --> 00:15:57,436
- What are we talking about--
- I like it.

300
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,305
I used to make it for my kids
on Sunday nights.

301
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,474
Sunday was my night
with the kids.

302
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:05,744
Brown sugar and ketchup.

303
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:08,447
You slow-cook it for eight hours--
That's the trick.

304
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,115
The kids loved it.

305
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:12,016
Solomon, it's shit like this
that makes me nervous.

306
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,419
- Can I give you the name of a guy?
- A doctor?

307
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,189
- Somebody to talk to.
- I come to you with a story--

308
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,791
The NSA is illegally--
And you wanna send me to a doctor?

309
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,459
I'm just being a friend.

310
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,629
I don't have friends
and I don't want friends.

311
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,700
All right.

312
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,104
<i>TMI</i>--

313
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:34,506
You said you had proof
they were hacking.

314
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,141
Was that a lie?

315
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,310
- Did you use that as bait so--
- I don't lie.

316
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:42,314
I've paid for sex, yes.
I tried to see my wife, yes.

317
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:45,183
- I don't see what that has to do with anything.
- Okay.

318
00:16:45,217 --> 00:16:48,486
- Then let me say that I've acted in good faith.
- No.

319
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,588
- I've acted in good faith.
- You didn't act at all.

320
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:52,556
I'll continue to pursue the NSA story
as hard as I can.

321
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:57,362
No, no, we had a deal--
I see the NSA story on ACN,

322
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,764
and then I hand over the <i>TMI</i> proof.

323
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,633
- Hand it over now.
- So you can destroy it?

324
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:06,671
No, so I can help out a friend
who's a lot like you.

325
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:10,174
And he will, I promise you,

326
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,210
not rest

327
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:16,314
until he's reported the NSA story,
assuming it's as solid as you say.

328
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:17,982
- Then you won't need me at all.
- Solomon--

329
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:21,419
If I give you the <i>TMI</i> proof,
you won't need me at all.

330
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:23,654
Do you know
how many years it's been

331
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:27,158
since my kids have come over
for dinner on Sunday?

332
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:28,959
No.

333
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,035
Adding further to investors' jitters,

334
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:39,137
Wall Street is waiting
for Friday's jobs report.

335
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:40,606
But some optimists I've talked to

336
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,810
expect the report to show that
the US created 75,000 jobs in July

337
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:48,847
and the unemployment rate
may hold steady at 9.2%.

338
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,617
For more on that--
ACN financial analyst Kelly Slade.

339
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:53,252
You got a job offer?

340
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:55,721
- Can you wait until we're alone?
- Are you considering it?

341
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:58,858
- I was taken to lunch.
- Oh, it all starts with the lunch.

342
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,459
- <i>Sloan?</i>
- Thanks, Kelly.

343
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:02,662
We'll be coming back to you for
the Market Wrap-Up at 4:30.

344
00:18:02,696 --> 00:18:04,030
I'm Sloan Sabbith.

345
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:06,565
Now back to Robin Burnett
and <i>Best of Health</i>.

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,501
<i>And we're clear.</i>

347
00:18:08,535 --> 00:18:10,903
- An innocent lunch.
- That's what it was.

348
00:18:10,937 --> 00:18:12,471
- Where?
- The Ocean Club.

349
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,106
- Why?
- I was hungry.

350
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:16,142
- Hey--
- An ACN poll released two days ago

351
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:17,610
has 42% of Americans

352
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,212
believing that when
we raised the debt ceiling,

353
00:18:19,246 --> 00:18:20,680
it means borrowing more money.

354
00:18:20,714 --> 00:18:22,348
- That's nothing new.
- I know that's nothing new!

355
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,385
- In here.
- I know that's nothing new. That's my point.

356
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:28,020
I've been talking about it almost every night
since the mid-terms,

357
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,589
and I haven't moved
the needle at all.

358
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:31,758
Well, you're not gonna move it
in venture capital.

359
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,093
- I'll get paid.
- You're just having one of those days.

360
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:38,331
Will says he's not coming back.

361
00:18:38,365 --> 00:18:40,366
Ask a boxer who's just
been knocked unconscious

362
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,670
<i>when he'd like to schedule
his next bout.</i>

363
00:18:43,704 --> 00:18:45,105
Friday will be my last day.

364
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:46,673
- You've made up your mind?
- Yeah.

365
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,742
Then I have three days
to change your mind.

366
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:50,678
42% was exactly the same number

367
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,413
- as before I started talking--
- Maybe it would've gone higher.

368
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,515
Maybe you helped
keep it at 42%.

369
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,892
- I have to get ready for Wrap-Up.
- Okay.

370
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:05,561
Wait.

371
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,529
Nah, it's all right.

372
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,564
- No, wait. No.
- Okay.

373
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,566
- Yes, all right.
- This can only be about Maggie.

374
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:14,402
I'm gonna ask her
to move in with me.

375
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:16,838
I see.

376
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,574
First, let me say you made
a very wise decision

377
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:22,843
- coming to me with this problem.
- It's not a problem.

378
00:19:22,877 --> 00:19:24,711
Well, let's see
what I can do about that.

379
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,146
How would you want to be asked?

380
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,447
- To move in with a guy?
- Yeah.

381
00:19:27,482 --> 00:19:29,516
By having the guy say
"Will you marry me?"

382
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,952
Okay, well, let's just take that
off the table for the moment.

383
00:19:31,986 --> 00:19:34,454
You know, if you're living together,
it makes it harder to break up.

384
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:37,190
- Well, that's the idea.
- You have to get cartons.

385
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,692
You've been no help at all.

386
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:41,661
Since I'm never going
to see you again after Friday,

387
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:43,597
- I feel like I can tell you something.
- We'll see each other.

388
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:45,866
- Maybe not after I say what I'm going to say.
- And you're not leaving.

389
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,036
I don't know who told you
you're a bad guy,

390
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,904
but somebody did,

391
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,073
somebody along the way.

392
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:56,677
Somebody or something
convinced you of it

393
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,913
because you think
you're a bad guy,

394
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,982
and you're just not.

395
00:20:02,016 --> 00:20:04,284
I'm socially inept,
but even I know that.

396
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:08,088
So because you're a bad guy,
you try to do things

397
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:12,026
you think a good guy would do,

398
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:13,828
like committing
to someone you like

399
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,629
but maybe don't love.

400
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,535
A sweet, smart,
wholesome Midwestern girl.

401
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,442
I could be wrong.
I almost always am.

402
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,049
Why are you single?

403
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:37,018
A lot of men are intimidated
by my intelligence.

404
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,987
No, seriously.

405
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:43,392
Because you never asked me out.

406
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,796
Caught you off-guard,
didn't I?

407
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,734
Yeah, you really did.

408
00:20:54,805 --> 00:20:57,172
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

409
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,109
Now I don't remember why.

410
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:02,946
Don and Maggie
are moving in together.

411
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,514
- Yeah?
- I still have to ask her.

412
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:06,449
Seriously?

413
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:09,318
That's great!
Cool.

414
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,054
I didn't-- All right.

415
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,555
Good luck.

416
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:15,323
- In your apartment?
- Hmm?

417
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,859
You're moving in together
in your apartment?

418
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,427
No, in fact.
We're gonna live among the hill people.

419
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,997
- I didn't know if you were gonna--
- We'll start at my apartment.

420
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,566
- <i>Okay. So--</i>
- I really don't remember why I asked you in here.

421
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,802
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

422
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:31,906
I'll see you later.

423
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,184
You're wrong.

424
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,522
I do want to commit to Maggie.

425
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:53,194
Well, that's what
a good guy would do.

426
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,891
<i>Shit.</i>

427
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:30,532
I was just checking this.
I'll fix it.

428
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,568
Yeah, the nurse can get that back in there.

429
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,906
Does it feel like something life-threatening
is happening right now?

430
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,941
- What is it I'm wearing?
- I bought you some pajamas.

431
00:22:39,975 --> 00:22:41,476
- You like them?
- How did I get into them?

432
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,912
The nurse changed you into them
while you were asleep.

433
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:47,382
- What's wrong here?
- He knocked out one of his tubes.

434
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:49,550
- Don't play with these.
- You really shouldn't.

435
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:51,185
She changed my clothes?

436
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,120
- <i>Um, well--</i>
- Hey.

437
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,622
Hey! Look!

438
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:57,892
- Jim's here.
- Yeah, I can see him, too.

439
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,760
Tell us what's happening, Jim.

440
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:02,062
The JPL says the Mars orbiter
may have found water.

441
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:03,497
- Do you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

442
00:23:03,531 --> 00:23:05,065
- And where did they find the water?
- God.

443
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,633
- On Mars.
- Cool.

444
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,536
There was another lockdown at Virginia Tech,
but it was a false alarm.

445
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:11,772
- Jim says there was another--
- I am right here.

446
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:14,074
- How about office gossip?
- Office gossip?

447
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:15,677
Yes.

448
00:23:15,711 --> 00:23:19,047
Maybe you can lift Will's spirits
with tales from the office.

449
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:20,916
Why is she talking like this?

450
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,752
Everything's pretty much the same.

451
00:23:23,786 --> 00:23:25,755
People miss you.
They're worried about you.

452
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,024
Don's asking Maggie
to move in with him,

453
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:32,461
which is great
for Don and the world.

454
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:34,329
They put Fresca
in the vending machines.

455
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:35,897
- What?!
- The vending machines have Fresca.

456
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:37,899
- Maggie's moving in with Don?
- He's asking her.

457
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:39,934
- What about the speech I gave you?
- Which one?

458
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,802
- What do you mean which one?
- You give a lot of--

459
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:43,303
"Gather ye rosebuds," Jim!

460
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,938
When I told you
to gather ye rosebuds.

461
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,340
- Did you?
- I did. Yes.

462
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:49,309
- But--
- What?

463
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,344
I accidentally gathered
the wrong rosebuds.

464
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,280
- What are you talking about?
- I took action-- That very night.

465
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:55,415
I went to Maggie's.

466
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,216
But before
I had a chance to say anything,

467
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,784
Lisa kissed me
and we were out the door.

468
00:23:58,818 --> 00:24:01,287
- Why?
- Lisa thought I was there to see her.

469
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:03,822
- Why?
- Classic case of...

470
00:24:03,857 --> 00:24:05,424
that happening.

471
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:07,726
- That was two months ago.
- Yeah.

472
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,528
- And what's happened since?
- I've been dating Lisa.

473
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,034
Ow! Ow!

474
00:24:16,069 --> 00:24:18,036
- Do you want to end up like me and him?
- No!

475
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:20,272
Wasting time?
And now he's practically dead.

476
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:21,874
- I'm not practically dead.
- Eat some Jell-O.

477
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,576
You've got to do something
before he asks her.

478
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,710
- No.
- Why not?

479
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:26,345
It doesn't seem like
a very nice thing

480
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,214
to do to Don or Maggie or Lisa.

481
00:24:28,248 --> 00:24:30,482
So you're willing to end up
like the two of us--

482
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:34,086
a strong, beautiful,
vital woman

483
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,188
and a hollowed-out
shell of a man?

484
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,791
- You know I'm awake now?
- That's a dead person speaking, basically.

485
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:42,594
And now I'm gonna have to spend the next
God knows how many hours in mourning.

486
00:24:42,629 --> 00:24:44,029
- Please go back to work.
- He will.

487
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:46,165
- I'm talking to you.
- I will.

488
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:52,304
The piece was bullshit.
Believe that.

489
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,872
Feel better.

490
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:00,611
Why was it so important to you?

491
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:03,480
- I think I'm gonna sleep for a while.
- Why did you want the story?

492
00:25:03,514 --> 00:25:05,649
I didn't think it was
gonna come out like this.

493
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,884
Obviously, but why did you
want the story in the first place?

494
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,155
- You'll say it's stupid.
- Why did you want the piece?

495
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:14,525
- At the end of <i>Camelot</i>--
- God!

496
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,195
- See?
- What? What happens at the end of <i>Camelot</i>?

497
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:19,197
England goes to war with France.

498
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:22,133
But King Arthur finds a stowaway,
a young kid.

499
00:25:22,168 --> 00:25:25,003
And he orders the kid to run
from village to village,

500
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,973
telling everyone about Camelot
and the Knights of the Round Table

501
00:25:28,007 --> 00:25:30,108
so that everyone
will know it's possible.

502
00:25:30,176 --> 00:25:32,811
The magazine piece was
supposed to be my young kid.

503
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,714
Do you have any life philosophy
that isn't based on a musical?

504
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:38,183
Hey, Dulcinea, I wasn't the one
who came in a year ago

505
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:39,685
talking about <i>Don Quixote</i>.

506
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:41,220
It lit a fire under your ass.

507
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:44,156
It lit my ass on fire.
That's not the same thing.

508
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,291
You have to stop telling people
you're not coming back.

509
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:47,626
You're scaring
the hell out of them.

510
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,628
- They need to be prepared.
- No, they don't.

511
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,364
Everything's going to be fine.
Everything's going to be great.

512
00:25:52,398 --> 00:25:55,934
- There's just one thing.
- What?

513
00:25:55,969 --> 00:25:58,203
Nina Howard has a source
that knows you were high

514
00:25:58,271 --> 00:25:59,671
during the bin Laden broadcast.

515
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,173
She's waiting for a second source.

516
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:03,442
And when she has it,
it'll be published.

517
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:05,978
And Reese and Leona will fire you
and your career will end in disgrace.

518
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:08,915
Well, the good news is
I'm already disgraced.

519
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:11,250
I'm pre-disgraced,
so I'm disgrace-proof.

520
00:26:11,285 --> 00:26:12,218
Who do you think her source is?

521
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:13,753
I don't know.
I don't care.

522
00:26:13,787 --> 00:26:15,588
- I like Jell-O.
- Snap out of it!

523
00:26:15,622 --> 00:26:18,458
- Can I have the mean nurse back?
- Yes.

524
00:26:29,436 --> 00:26:32,071
- Yeah?
- I've got some very bad news.

525
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:34,340
I'm kind of maxed out
on bad news.

526
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,142
Can it wait?

527
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,012
Last night,
a man rode his bicycle

528
00:26:39,046 --> 00:26:42,749
to the middle of the Queensboro Bridge
and jumped off.

529
00:26:42,783 --> 00:26:44,584
They've just identified
the body as--

530
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:46,687
No.

531
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:48,789
Solomon Hancock.

532
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:51,992
<i>He killed himself last night.</i>

533
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,665
All right.

534
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,708
Call your parents once in a while.

535
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:08,010
It's really not that hard.

536
00:27:09,946 --> 00:27:11,780
Yeah.

537
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,987
I'm what the leaders
of the Tea Party

538
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:21,590
would call a RINO--
Republican In Name Only.

539
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:23,858
And that's ironic,
because that's exactly what I think

540
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,359
about the leaders of the Tea Party,

541
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,829
because the most conservative
Republicans today

542
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,364
aren't Republicans.

543
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,633
Republicans believe
in a prohibitive military.

544
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:34,502
We believe
in a common-sense government

545
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,404
and that there are
social programs enacted

546
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,239
in the last half-century
that work,

547
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,309
but there are way too many
costing way too much that don't.

548
00:27:41,343 --> 00:27:43,177
And we believe in the rule
of law and order

549
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:44,779
and free-market capitalism.

550
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:47,381
The Tea Party believes
in loving America,

551
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,016
but hating Americans.

552
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:51,686
Tea Party Congressman
Allen West of Florida.

553
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,923
"I must confess when I see anyone
with an Obama bumper sticker,

554
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:57,960
I recognize them as
a threat to the gene pool."

555
00:27:57,994 --> 00:28:01,064
They believe in loving America,
but hating its government.

556
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,199
<i>Conservative activist
Grover Norquist.</i>

557
00:28:03,234 --> 00:28:04,734
<i>I don't want to
abolish government,</i>

558
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:07,070
<i>I simply want to reduce it
to the size where I can</i>

559
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,439
<i>drag it into the bathroom
and drown it in the bathtub."</i>

560
00:28:09,473 --> 00:28:12,342
And they believe that anyone
who disagrees with the Tea Party

561
00:28:12,376 --> 00:28:14,911
has sinister anti-American motives.

562
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:17,647
The objective of the liberals
is to destroy this country.

563
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:20,250
The objective of the liberals
is to make America mediocre.

564
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,519
<i>Most of all,
you must never,</i>

565
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:23,920
under any circumstance,

566
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:26,122
seek to reach a compromise
with your opponent

567
00:28:26,157 --> 00:28:30,527
or do any of what Democrats
and genuine Republicans both call "governing."

568
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:33,496
Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

569
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:36,132
Our top political priority
over the next two years

570
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:39,034
should be to deny
President Obama a second term.

571
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:41,370
And one other plank
in the Tea Party platform--

572
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:44,339
If you're poor,
it means you're either too lazy

573
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,841
or too stupid to be rich.

574
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,143
Here's André Bauer,
Tea Party leader

575
00:28:48,177 --> 00:28:50,646
and Lieutenant Governor
of South Carolina.

576
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,383
<i>"My grandmother was not
a highly educated woman,</i>

577
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,251
<i>but she told me
as a small child</i>

578
00:28:55,286 --> 00:28:57,454
<i>to quit feeding stray animals.</i>

579
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,956
<i>You know why?
Because they breed."</i>

580
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,625
It's almost hard to believe
Republicans can't get

581
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,961
Dorothy Cooper to vote for them.

582
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:09,066
- Don't give up on this.
- It's not up to me.

583
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,534
We have the guy.
We've had him for 10 weeks.

584
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:12,970
We have a guy named Charizma.

585
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:14,638
Tell me where he lives
and I'll kick in his door.

586
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:15,973
I get we only have an alias,

587
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,875
but he fucked up once
already because of his ego.

588
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,778
He'll fuck up again.
Let me keep smoking him out.

589
00:29:20,813 --> 00:29:22,413
Excuse me, Mr. Skinner.
I'm sorry.

590
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:24,149
You can just leave that
on Millie's desk.

591
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:25,784
She's not here right now
and it was messengered.

592
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:27,252
It says "Personal and Confidential."

593
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,687
They all say
"Personal and Confidential."

594
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,489
- I'll take it.
- Yes, sir.

595
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:32,090
How are you gonna
smoke him out?

596
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,259
I've already taken credit
for the death threat.

597
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,894
Now let me say
the FBI caught me.

598
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,697
His head will explode
because he and his friends

599
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:40,431
know the FBI is way outclassed,

600
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:42,867
outnumbered
and technologically behind.

601
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:45,069
- He'll wanna prove he didn't get caught.
- Yeah.

602
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:46,938
And what happens then?

603
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:49,574
I don't know.

604
00:29:49,608 --> 00:29:51,742
That's always my favorite answer.

605
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,544
- Charlie--
- Please, don't mess around with these--

606
00:29:53,611 --> 00:29:55,679
Go ahead.

607
00:29:56,648 --> 00:29:58,649
- I'm sorry?
- Do it.

608
00:29:58,683 --> 00:30:01,385
Great.
Thank you.

609
00:30:21,773 --> 00:30:23,240
My name is Jenny.
I'm a sophomore,

610
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:25,042
and this is for all three of you.

611
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,611
<i>Can you say in one sentence
or less what--</i>

612
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:29,880
<i>Um, you know what I mean.</i>

613
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:32,215
Can you say why America

614
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,485
is the greatest country
in the world?

615
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,054
- How are you feeling?
- Very handsome.

616
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:39,022
The doctor says
you can go home Monday

617
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:40,457
and come back to work
in a week.

618
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,825
I like it here.
Being bedridden suits me.

619
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,228
How many times do I have to tell you
this guy is an idiot?

620
00:30:46,263 --> 00:30:49,364
Hell hath no fury like the second rate.
Don't you know that?

621
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,167
He quotes my colleagues,
everyone I respect in news.

622
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,002
- You respect the wrong people.
- No.

623
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,004
- Were any of them quoted by name?
- Plenty of them.

624
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,806
Anyone that doesn't have
an axe to grind with you?

625
00:30:57,841 --> 00:31:02,077
The rest were pussy-ass, coward-ass,
pussified pussies.

626
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,613
It just doesn't matter anymore.

627
00:31:04,648 --> 00:31:06,782
You're right, it doesn't.

628
00:31:06,817 --> 00:31:08,384
It just doesn't.

629
00:31:08,418 --> 00:31:11,687
You wanna hear
something that does?

630
00:31:11,722 --> 00:31:13,857
I just want you
to say hi to someone.

631
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,860
- Nurse Cooper.
- Oh, please, not Nurse Cooper.

632
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:20,697
She's not nice
and I think she's trying to euthanize me.

633
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:22,465
I heard that.

634
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,802
Nurses are the most
underappreciated members of our society.

635
00:31:25,836 --> 00:31:28,005
I've handled
bigger schmucks than you.

636
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:30,274
- Tell him about your great-aunt.
- Seriously?

637
00:31:30,308 --> 00:31:34,512
My great-aunt Dorothy Cooper
is 96 years old

638
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,848
and has been voting
for 75 years.

639
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:39,584
Now the state of Tennessee is saying
she can't vote.

640
00:31:39,618 --> 00:31:42,087
Voter ID?

641
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:45,090
- I wanna know what you're gonna do about that.
- Well, there's not a lot I--

642
00:31:45,124 --> 00:31:47,559
- I wanna know why I don't see it on the news.
- Well, the reason--

643
00:31:47,593 --> 00:31:49,694
Why did my aunt
become less American

644
00:31:49,729 --> 00:31:52,030
- because she doesn't have a car?
- Yeah, that's a reasonable--

645
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:56,300
And why, young man, isn't this
the first story on the news every night?

646
00:31:57,569 --> 00:31:58,769
- She usually decides.
- Shut up.

647
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,670
Okay.

648
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:03,573
I want to see this story on the news.

649
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:11,081
I kind of wanna
see it on the news, too.

650
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:18,522
Will?

651
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,428
Will?

652
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:30,167
- The voicemail message.
- What are you talking about?

653
00:32:30,202 --> 00:32:34,138
The voicemail message that I left you
that night after I got home

654
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:36,908
from the bin Laden broadcast--
Did you play it for anyone?

655
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:38,510
- I never got a message.
- No, I--

656
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:40,746
I left you that message that started,

657
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,414
"Hey, listen. It's me.

658
00:32:42,449 --> 00:32:44,817
I'm not just saying this
because I'm high right now."

659
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:47,253
- Did anyone else hear that message?
- I didn't hear that message.

660
00:32:47,287 --> 00:32:50,756
Mac, there is no way that you don't remember
what that message said.

661
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,392
It wouldn't be possible
for me to remember

662
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,794
what it said because I never got it.

663
00:32:55,829 --> 00:32:57,964
And it wouldn't have been possible
for me to play it

664
00:32:57,998 --> 00:33:01,634
for someone else because
I never got it.

665
00:33:04,472 --> 00:33:07,074
Nina's first source was you.

666
00:33:08,676 --> 00:33:10,644
- Yeah.
- Guys, I don't under--

667
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:13,613
And that's why <i>TMI</i> is waiting
for the second source.

668
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:17,817
- They can't reveal how they got the first.
- There was no message!

669
00:33:17,852 --> 00:33:20,420
Because your phone was hacked

670
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:22,622
and they deleted it.

671
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,534
- What are you doing?
- I am reporting on Dorothy Cooper.

672
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:38,772
- You're still sick.
- "What is illness to the body of our knight errant?"

673
00:33:38,806 --> 00:33:40,574
"What matter wounds?

674
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,410
For each time he falls--"

675
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:43,778
- Ah!
<i>- What's he doing?</i>

676
00:33:43,812 --> 00:33:46,113
The end of <i>Don Quixote</i>.
Put the tubes back.

677
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:48,549
"Each time he falls,
he shall rise again.

678
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,751
<i>Woe to the wicked.</i>

679
00:33:49,785 --> 00:33:52,454
Sancho, my armor, my sword!"

680
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,023
- Which one of us is he talking to?
- Get back in bed!

681
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:57,826
I'm fine.
Okay, I'm a little dizzy.

682
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,595
I've got alarms going off
at the nurse's station.

683
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:01,864
- Who pulled out the IV line?
- She did.

684
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:05,134
I need to get some information
about your great-aunt.

685
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:14,010
We need two maps--
One with every voter ID law

686
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:15,745
and another with
Tea Party governors' wins.

687
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:20,349
He didn't create the recession,

688
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:22,217
but he made it worse
and longer.

689
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,886
When he took office,

690
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,889
the economy was in recession
and he made it worse.

691
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:30,159
An NBC reporter asks Romney
why he keeps saying

692
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,528
Obama made the economy worse
when it's gotten better.

693
00:34:32,562 --> 00:34:33,929
And here's Romney's answer.

694
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:35,998
I didn't say
that things are worse.

695
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:37,600
Cut the film.

696
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:38,835
This line that lookslike Kilimanjaro

697
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,403
shows profits for the job creators,

698
00:34:40,438 --> 00:34:43,006
and this line that's as flat as my abs
shows employment.

699
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,475
- Joey, build that graphic.
- Yes, ma'am.

700
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:00,356
<i>What I would say
is that the news media should do</i>

701
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,292
a penetrating exposé
and take a look.

702
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,726
I wish they would.

703
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:07,496
I wish the American media
would take a great look

704
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,199
<i>at the views of the people
in Congress and find out</i>

705
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,168
are they pro-America
or anti-America.

706
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:13,703
<i>I think people would be--</i>

707
00:35:13,771 --> 00:35:15,971
<i>would love to see
an exposé like that.</i>

708
00:35:24,982 --> 00:35:28,017
The RNC just released an ad
slamming Obama for vacation days.

709
00:35:28,051 --> 00:35:30,319
Obama has taken
61 vacation days.

710
00:35:30,354 --> 00:35:33,423
At this point in his first term,
Reagan had taken 112

711
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:36,492
while George W. Bush
had taken 180.

712
00:35:39,363 --> 00:35:40,864
John Adams.

713
00:35:44,803 --> 00:35:47,972
Thomas Jefferson.

714
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,010
James Madison.

715
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:55,547
George Washington.

716
00:35:58,351 --> 00:35:59,885
The Treaty of Tripoli.

717
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:01,553
Go on home for the night.
You look tired.

718
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:04,222
I'm supposed to meet Don and Lisa for dinner,
but I can stay.

719
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:06,057
No, you look terrible.
You should get some sleep.

720
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:07,726
I've never seen you
look so bad.

721
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,828
- What are you doing?
- I was being supportive.

722
00:36:11,063 --> 00:36:13,932
- You're done for the night.
- Good night.

723
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:16,101
Ooh! Sorry.

724
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,945
"I can't make it.
Sorry.

725
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:28,981
Swing by my place around midnight."

726
00:36:29,015 --> 00:36:30,449
This is okay with you?

727
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:32,552
- He's working hard.
- On a Sunday?

728
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah, on a Sunday.

729
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:35,688
We've all been
working all weekend.

730
00:36:35,756 --> 00:36:39,157
And Don's been helping out
and it's not even his show.

731
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:40,726
What are you trying to say?

732
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,394
Nothing.
I'm sorry.

733
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:44,663
What are you trying to say?

734
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:46,665
In a year you've gone nowhere.

735
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,533
- Wait, that's--
- This is exactly what it was like

736
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,935
when the two of you started dating.

737
00:36:49,969 --> 00:36:51,436
"Swing by around midnight."

738
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:53,238
I'm not saying he needs
to take a knee,

739
00:36:53,273 --> 00:36:54,773
- but holy cow, how many times--
- I get it.

740
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:55,808
- Do you?
- Yes.

741
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:57,209
- Maggie--
- Stop.

742
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,845
- It's hard to watch you--
- It's hard to watch you!

743
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:05,050
What does that mean?

744
00:37:05,085 --> 00:37:06,819
Nothing.

745
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:08,321
What did it mean?

746
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:16,262
The night you and Jim
got back together...

747
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:19,632
When he came
to our place to see me?

748
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:22,235
- Lisa--
<i>- What?</i>

749
00:37:22,302 --> 00:37:24,237
I don't--

750
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:27,173
Don's not sure
he was there to see you.

751
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:29,475
What are you talking about?

752
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,877
- Nothing.
- What?

753
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:33,479
- I'm wrong.
- What do you mean

754
00:37:33,513 --> 00:37:34,847
he might not have
been there to see me?

755
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:39,017
You kissed him
and you pulled him out the door

756
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:41,520
before he finished his sentence.

757
00:37:51,297 --> 00:37:53,198
- I have to go.
- No. Lisa--

758
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:55,533
- No, it's okay.
<i>- No, I'm sure I'm wrong.</i>

759
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:58,236
- I forgot I have to be at a place.
- Lisa!

760
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,810
Lisa! Lisa!

761
00:38:04,844 --> 00:38:06,612
Oh!

762
00:38:08,314 --> 00:38:10,415
Are you fucking kidding me?!

763
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:12,918
To the left
is the famous brownstone

764
00:38:12,952 --> 00:38:16,788
where Carrie Bradshaw lived,
loved, and lost.

765
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:19,425
<i>Thanks to Carrie,
we all got to live</i>

766
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,728
the typical life of a single woman
in New York City.

767
00:38:25,065 --> 00:38:26,232
Hey!

768
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,534
No, you didn't!

769
00:38:28,568 --> 00:38:31,303
I'm a typical single woman
in New York City!

770
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:35,340
I don't wear heels to work because
the typical woman's job

771
00:38:35,374 --> 00:38:38,143
<i>doesn't exclusively involve
gallery openings.</i>

772
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,311
And I know Carrie
must have made boatloads

773
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:42,847
writing her 800-word column
for a newspaper

774
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:45,716
no one's ever heard of,
but I just spent my last $7

775
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,385
having a fight
with my best friend

776
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:51,289
who, by the way,
is not available at 3:00 p.m. on a Wednesday

777
00:38:51,323 --> 00:38:55,260
to console me about some guy,
because she, too, has a job.

778
00:38:55,328 --> 00:38:58,931
And mostly, when you fall for a guy and he's going out

779
00:38:58,965 --> 00:39:01,834
with your best friend,
it doesn't work out.

780
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:04,437
Things get really bad!

781
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:07,340
Maggie?

782
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:11,911
Oh, no.

783
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,515
I was just--

784
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:20,252
I was talking about other people.

785
00:39:21,822 --> 00:39:23,623
<i>Stay right there.</i>

786
00:39:23,657 --> 00:39:26,192
<i>Maggie, wait! Let me off!</i>

787
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:28,728
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

788
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:31,857
I'm with Lisa.

789
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:34,760
I know.

790
00:40:35,996 --> 00:40:38,464
And you're with Don.

791
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:42,802
I don't know if I want to be.

792
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:46,973
If Don had committed to you?

793
00:40:48,142 --> 00:40:49,809
- He didn't.
- But if he did?

794
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:52,846
Then neither of us
would be standing here.

795
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:02,522
You should get some sleep.

796
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,624
You, too.

797
00:41:06,726 --> 00:41:08,494
I have to talk to Don.

798
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,885
During Tea Party rallies
and campaign speeches,

799
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:34,654
we've been told that America
was founded as a Christian nation

800
00:41:34,689 --> 00:41:36,222
and that if the Founding Fathers

801
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:38,191
were here today,
they'd tell us so.

802
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:41,161
Here's John Adams
in the Treaty of Tripoli--

803
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:44,063
"As the government
of the United States is not,

804
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:46,833
in any sense,
founded on the Christian religion--"

805
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,502
And here's Thomas Jefferson--

806
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:51,004
"That our civil rights
have no dependence

807
00:41:51,038 --> 00:41:53,073
on our religious opinions."

808
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:55,676
<i>And here's the First Amendment
to the US Constitution--</i>

809
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,078
"Congress shall make
no law respecting

810
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,646
an establishment of religion."

811
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:01,348
What's more frightening

812
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:03,250
than the perversion
of our great history

813
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:05,352
is that sensible, smart,
strong Republicans,

814
00:42:05,386 --> 00:42:09,423
the very men and women who should be
standing up to radical fundamentalism,

815
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,924
are so frightened
of losing primary battles

816
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,161
to religious zealots that
they've thrown in the towel on sanity.

817
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:16,729
So we get this--

818
00:42:16,763 --> 00:42:20,733
Y-Yes, the--
The Constitution established

819
00:42:20,767 --> 00:42:23,202
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.

820
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:26,572
It's ironic because the biggest enemy
of the phony Republican

821
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,707
isn't Nancy Pelosi or Harry Reid

822
00:42:28,775 --> 00:42:30,609
or Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama,

823
00:42:30,644 --> 00:42:33,213
it's this man.

824
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:36,149
He said, "Heal the sick,
feed the hungry,

825
00:42:36,184 --> 00:42:40,421
care for the weakest among us,
and always pray in private."

826
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:42,723
"It's been over a year.

827
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:45,594
I'm not your midnight girl."

828
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:48,764
Midnight thing.

829
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:51,132
Mid-- Ugh,
midnight piece of ass.

830
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:52,634
Midnight girl.

831
00:42:52,668 --> 00:42:56,338
"I'm not your midnight girl."

832
00:42:56,372 --> 00:42:58,540
Not <i>a</i> midnight girl?

833
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:00,141
Your midnight girl?

834
00:43:06,515 --> 00:43:08,083
Hi.

835
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:10,285
Don't say anything.
Just let me talk.

836
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,287
Okay.

837
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,026
Hang on.

838
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,435
"Don, I was disappointed
and embarrassed"--

839
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,538
Do you wanna come in?

840
00:43:29,572 --> 00:43:32,141
Okay.

841
00:43:35,979 --> 00:43:38,881
"Don, I was
disappointed and"--

842
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:42,051
What's happening now?

843
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,992
I'm asking you
to move in with me.

844
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:56,499
This is a key.

845
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,334
I already have a key.

846
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,470
This one's in a box.

847
00:44:03,439 --> 00:44:06,141
I badly want to make this work.

848
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,529
<i>Hi, you've reached
the voicemail of Maggie Jordan.</i>

849
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,431
<i>I can't get to the phone
right now,</i>

850
00:44:26,465 --> 00:44:29,667
<i>but please leave a message
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.</i>

851
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:42,179
The idea of strict or absolute
separation of church and state

852
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:45,081
is not and never was
the American model.

853
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,284
- You ready?
<i>- Now it's a model</i>

854
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,853
<i>used in countries
like Turkey and France.</i>

855
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,591
- Good evening.
- Evening.

856
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:58,729
- Will, good to see you up and about.
- Thank you.

857
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:00,363
Thank you
for the gift basket--

858
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:01,932
The Tabasco and cayenne pepper.

859
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,200
I'm crazy about
your sense of humor.

860
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,969
I thought you'd appreciate it.

861
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,404
And you have a body
that refuses to quit.

862
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:10,240
If <i>Playboy</i> ever decided to do a
"Women of NASDAQ" layout--

863
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,776
Reese tells me
you were high on the air

864
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,011
<i>while reporting on the death
of Osama bin Laden.</i>

865
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,347
It would be a tasteful layout.

866
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,649
Like, "Ooh, I dropped my quarterly
stockholders report."

867
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:21,484
You were high on the air?

868
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,185
Now, how would you know that,
Reese?

869
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,190
Will, were you high on the air
the night we killed bin Laden?

870
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:31,126
I was.

871
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:33,629
- You're admitting it?
- Could not feel my face.

872
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:37,166
Well...

873
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,734
You were very good.

874
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,037
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, and you're fired.

875
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:43,173
- You can't fire him.
- Yet I just did.

876
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,843
Okay, but if you do,
your son's going to jail for a little while.

877
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:49,246
What the hell are you talking about?

878
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,281
- You hacked my phone.
- No, I didn't.

879
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,816
This will go a lot faster if you'd just say,
"Yes, I did."

880
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,484
- I didn't.
- We have a show in an hour.

881
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,586
- And you're fired, too.
- Why is she saying you hacked--

882
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:00,188
- Desperation.
- You hacked her phone

883
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:03,625
and you deleted the message from Will
where he said he was high.

884
00:46:03,659 --> 00:46:06,427
- You got some proof?
- That's how Nina Howard knew that Will was high.

885
00:46:06,462 --> 00:46:10,098
- You got proof?
- Solomon Hancock.

886
00:46:10,132 --> 00:46:12,567
He's an NSA analyst
who was giving me information

887
00:46:12,602 --> 00:46:14,870
<i>about illegal domestic surveillance.</i>

888
00:46:14,904 --> 00:46:19,107
He jumped off the Queensboro Bridge
four days ago.

889
00:46:19,142 --> 00:46:23,579
But before he did,
he had this envelope sent to me.

890
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:27,651
It's a record of Reese
ordering hacking of phones

891
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:29,452
belonging to Mackenzie McHale,

892
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:32,054
Howard Stern,
Casey Anthony's lawyers,

893
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,392
<i>and relatives of hostages
killed by Somali pirates.</i>

894
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:38,427
It's all here.

895
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,896
Leona,
didn't you ever ask how <i>TMI</i>

896
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,165
<i>got some of the information
it published?</i>

897
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,702
- I just assumed they made it up.
- They do, most of the time,

898
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,638
<i>but Nina didn't make this up.</i>

899
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:50,640
In this case,
I thought that someone on the staff--

900
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,441
There's a transcript
in this envelope--

901
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,243
Did you order hacking?

902
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:57,847
Reese?

903
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,152
I ordered that the magazine
stay competitive.

904
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:04,420
Answer the question.
Did you order--

905
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,188
Yes.

906
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:07,723
All right?
I did.

907
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:10,359
Are you out of your mind?
That's a felony.

908
00:47:10,393 --> 00:47:12,026
This is how
the tabloid world works

909
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,362
and that magazine turns a profit
in a competitive market.

910
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,431
And, by the way,
this is what you wanted.

911
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:20,000
No, it's not.

912
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:24,771
It is not remotely
what I wanted, ever.

913
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:27,173
Good enough?

914
00:47:28,476 --> 00:47:32,011
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

915
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:34,147
I don't give a shit.
Hand it to the FBI.

916
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:35,982
I'll go to jail before I'm blackmailed.

917
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:38,985
- You're not going to jail.
- I'm not being fucking blackmailed.

918
00:47:39,019 --> 00:47:40,887
You get your lawyers,
I'll get mine.

919
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,089
Leona, you're one of us.
You know you are.

920
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:46,124
Stand for something.

921
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,027
These guys do.
They were willing to lose their jobs.

922
00:47:49,061 --> 00:47:51,129
This guy does.
He jumped off a bridge.

923
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:57,268
They're lying, Leona.
They're just lying.

924
00:47:57,302 --> 00:47:59,670
A bunch of fatuous,
mean-spirited bigots

925
00:47:59,705 --> 00:48:03,207
<i>screaming platitudes about
what America stands for.</i>

926
00:48:03,241 --> 00:48:06,543
Let's show 'em
what we won't stand for.

927
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:10,480
Let's do the news.

928
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:12,083
You and me.

929
00:48:16,354 --> 00:48:18,989
And what about this and the tape?

930
00:48:19,023 --> 00:48:20,991
You're gonna kill
the story about Will.

931
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:22,526
Ours was the best
coverage of the night

932
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,129
<i>and Will anchored it beautifully.</i>

933
00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:26,263
<i>No more tabloid stories.</i>

934
00:48:26,298 --> 00:48:27,698
And I'm gonna
make it easy for you

935
00:48:27,733 --> 00:48:29,166
because you're
shutting down your tabloid.

936
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:30,968
You want me to shut down
a profit center?

937
00:48:31,003 --> 00:48:34,039
You reported $14 billion
of net revenue last year.

938
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:36,308
<i>You won't miss the $80 million
from </i>TMI<i>.</i>

939
00:48:36,342 --> 00:48:38,510
And what reason
do we give publicly?

940
00:48:38,544 --> 00:48:41,313
You don't fancy yourselves
the owner of a whore house.

941
00:48:41,347 --> 00:48:43,282
<i>You'll get terrific press.</i>

942
00:48:43,316 --> 00:48:46,785
You know me well enough to know
I do not negotiate like this.

943
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:51,290
This wasn't a negotiation.

944
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:53,125
<i>They're gonna do their show.</i>

945
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,227
<i>You think about it.</i>

946
00:48:55,262 --> 00:49:00,099
And whatever happens next
happens next.

947
00:49:10,177 --> 00:49:12,879
Give six months' salary
to a school or something.

948
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:17,283
Will.

949
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:24,324
Don't shoot and miss.

950
00:49:27,661 --> 00:49:30,563
Lucky for Will he's got
the aim of a sharpshooter

951
00:49:30,598 --> 00:49:33,433
who's been trained to shoot
and hit the target that--

952
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:35,569
- You can't just start to say something with--
- I know, I'm sorry.

953
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:44,811
We don't have
to lay down for this.

954
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:51,719
Oh, God.

955
00:49:51,753 --> 00:49:53,354
What?

956
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:57,025
It's a recipe for beef stew.

957
00:50:00,563 --> 00:50:02,898
You can't announce your
intention to not pay your bills

958
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,100
and then expect to keep
your credit rating.

959
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:06,635
Like petulant children,
the Tea Party

960
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,204
took the economy hostage
and then bragged about it.

961
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,739
Senate Minority Leader
Mitch McConnell

962
00:50:10,773 --> 00:50:11,907
to the <i>Washington Post</i>--

963
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,876
<i>"I think some of our members
may have thought</i>

964
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,344
<i>the default issue was a hostage</i>

965
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,113
<i>you might take a chance at shooting,"
he said.</i>

966
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,881
<i>"Most of us didn't think that.</i>

967
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:20,516
What we did learn is this--

968
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,451
It's a hostage worth ransoming."

969
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,320
Will.

970
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,923
We'll be right back.

971
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,624
<i>2:30 back.</i>

972
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,159
- Nice.
- Bring it home.

973
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,928
Who is the girl sitting
in the back of the newsroom?

974
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,163
- I don't know. Listen--
- She's been sitting there all day

975
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,066
and all through the broadcast,
and I feel like I know her.

976
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:40,303
Yeah. "The greater fool"
is actually an economic term.

977
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,405
- It's a patsy.
- Thanks for that.

978
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,441
For the rest of us to profit,
we need a greater fool,

979
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,943
someone who will buy long
and sell short.

980
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,879
Most people spend their lives

981
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,781
trying not to be
the greater fool.

982
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,382
We toss him the hot potato.

983
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,851
We dive for his seat
when the music stops.

984
00:50:55,885 --> 00:50:58,153
The greater fool is someone
with the perfect blend

985
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:00,089
of self-delusion and ego

986
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:03,492
to think that he can succeed
where others have failed.

987
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:07,496
This whole country
was made by greater fools.

988
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:12,936
You're staying?

989
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,877
<i>45 seconds back.</i>

990
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,446
- Hey, Joey.
<i>- Yes, ma'am.</i>

991
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,082
Back in the A block,
did you hear the sound go out after...

992
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:29,353
Did I hear the sound
go out after what?

993
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:32,423
Mac?

994
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,004
- What was the rest of the message?
- What?

995
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:50,408
"I'm not just saying this
because I'm high."

996
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:51,943
Saying what?

997
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:54,012
What was the rest of the message?

998
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,446
Hmm.

999
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,749
What was the rest of the message?

1000
00:51:57,783 --> 00:51:58,817
10 seconds.

1001
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:00,319
10 seconds.

1002
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,498
<i>In three, two...</i>

1003
00:52:15,668 --> 00:52:17,436
Ideological purity,

1004
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:18,971
compromise as weakness,

1005
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:21,240
a fundamentalist belief
in scriptural literalism,

1006
00:52:21,274 --> 00:52:24,576
denying science,
unmoved by facts,

1007
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:26,178
undeterred by new information,

1008
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:28,313
a hostile fear of progress,

1009
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,048
a demonization of education,

1010
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,551
<i>a need to control
women's bodies,</i>

1011
00:52:32,618 --> 00:52:34,152
severe xenophobia,

1012
00:52:34,187 --> 00:52:37,122
tribal mentality,
intolerance of dissent,

1013
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,958
and a pathological hatred
of US government.

1014
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:42,628
They can call
themselves the Tea Party.

1015
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:44,730
They can call themselves
conservatives.

1016
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:47,399
And they can even
call themselves Republicans,

1017
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:49,702
though Republicans
certainly shouldn't.

1018
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:51,804
But we should call them
what they are--

1019
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:54,139
The American Taliban.

1020
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,975
And the America Taliban
cannot survive

1021
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:59,912
if Dorothy Cooper
is allowed to vote.

1022
00:53:05,418 --> 00:53:07,920
Terry Smith is coming up next
with <i>The Capitol Report</i>.

1023
00:53:07,954 --> 00:53:08,787
This is <i>News Night</i>.

1024
00:53:08,822 --> 00:53:11,690
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

1025
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:17,197
<i>We're clear.</i>

1026
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:20,567
Good job.

1027
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:29,743
- I heard you were staying.
- Yes.

1028
00:53:29,777 --> 00:53:31,445
Yeah, I will still
be working here,

1029
00:53:31,479 --> 00:53:34,080
as will you,
and I am mortified.

1030
00:53:34,115 --> 00:53:36,083
We will both be working here,
but we will never speak

1031
00:53:36,117 --> 00:53:38,285
or make eye contact ever again
starting now.

1032
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,387
I don't think that's realistic.

1033
00:53:40,421 --> 00:53:43,189
I just turned down
$4 million a year

1034
00:53:43,224 --> 00:53:46,659
so that I can try to do some good
by reporting the news.

1035
00:53:46,694 --> 00:53:49,662
Do I sound like someone who's living
in the world of the realistic?

1036
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,065
- It's really--
- Starting now.

1037
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,041
I gotta get ready for the 10:00.

1038
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:03,244
- See you at Hang Chew's?
- Yeah.

1039
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:04,912
Mm.

1040
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,957
- Hello.
- Hey.

1041
00:54:18,493 --> 00:54:20,628
I can't be sure,
but I think you're avoiding me.

1042
00:54:21,863 --> 00:54:23,263
Lisa said you guys
had a good talk.

1043
00:54:23,298 --> 00:54:24,698
Yeah.

1044
00:54:24,732 --> 00:54:26,900
She asked me who
I really came to see

1045
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:29,703
that night we got
back together.

1046
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:32,239
And you lied to her.

1047
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,209
You made her very happy.

1048
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:38,545
I figured when you didn't
answer your phone--

1049
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:42,281
You--
You knew Don was asking me?

1050
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:44,050
Yeah.

1051
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:50,823
- You're a good guy.
- So is Don.

1052
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:55,729
- Jim--
- You know, I'm not done with that NSA story.

1053
00:54:55,763 --> 00:54:59,499
I'm gonna make sure Hancock
isn't dead for nothing.

1054
00:55:03,538 --> 00:55:05,173
What did the rest
of the message say?

1055
00:55:05,207 --> 00:55:08,310
I honestly don't remember.

1056
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:10,411
Did you know that Maggie and Don
are moving in together,

1057
00:55:10,446 --> 00:55:12,813
even though Maggie should be with Jim
and Don should be with Sloan?

1058
00:55:12,848 --> 00:55:15,383
How many lives must you ruin before
you'll get out of the life-ruining business?

1059
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:16,551
It's a cautionary tale.

1060
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:18,887
Maggie is now with the wrong man.

1061
00:55:18,955 --> 00:55:21,923
- It's not gonna last.
- Because true love always wins?

1062
00:55:21,957 --> 00:55:23,692
Yeah.

1063
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:29,998
It was a hallucination.

1064
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:32,266
I got asked the question
at Northwestern

1065
00:55:32,301 --> 00:55:34,636
"What makes America
the greatest country in the world?"

1066
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:37,506
There was a woman who looked like you
sitting in the audience.

1067
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,909
There were a lot of lights
and a lot of noise in my head,

1068
00:55:39,943 --> 00:55:41,777
and I could have sworn
that the woman

1069
00:55:41,812 --> 00:55:43,913
who looked like you
was holding up a...

1070
00:55:43,947 --> 00:55:46,049
pad.

1071
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,957
- It was you?
- Yep.

1072
00:55:53,992 --> 00:55:56,560
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1073
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,066
You're melting now, aren't you?

1074
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,405
Your heart is full.

1075
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:15,279
Just say what you're feeling.

1076
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:22,653
Why the <i>fuck</i>
didn't you tell me?

1077
00:56:22,688 --> 00:56:25,022
I was waiting for the right time!

1078
00:56:25,056 --> 00:56:27,158
15 months ago was the right time.

1079
00:56:27,225 --> 00:56:28,225
- Will--
- It was you!

1080
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,761
No, it was you, Billy.

1081
00:56:30,795 --> 00:56:32,629
I was just producing.

1082
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:35,465
What did the rest
of the message say?

1083
00:56:37,368 --> 00:56:38,902
There's a girl sitting
in the newsroom.

1084
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:40,836
- Don't worry about her.
- No, she looks familiar to me.

1085
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:42,838
She applying for an internship.
She's been waiting all day.

1086
00:56:42,873 --> 00:56:45,808
- Why does she look familiar?
- Excuse us.

1087
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:51,046
I'll be in the conference room.

1088
00:56:53,616 --> 00:56:55,684
What can I do for you?

1089
00:56:55,718 --> 00:56:57,853
Tell him, Columbo.

1090
00:56:57,887 --> 00:57:00,822
I--
I went on the message board

1091
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:02,224
and posted that I'd been caught

1092
00:57:02,258 --> 00:57:04,260
and that I was now being used
as an FBI informant.

1093
00:57:04,294 --> 00:57:07,497
I did this in the hope of smoking out
the real culprit because,

1094
00:57:07,531 --> 00:57:09,232
you see, the only thing
these people cherish

1095
00:57:09,266 --> 00:57:10,934
more than anonymity
is worldwide fame.

1096
00:57:10,968 --> 00:57:13,836
So by both taking credit and
implying we'd been defeated by--

1097
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:16,305
- What happened?
- You got 100 new death threats.

1098
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,675
- 100?
- Really more a protest than a threat.

1099
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:21,844
- Is that how the insurance company sees it?
- No.

1100
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:23,379
- No. So we're still--
- Yeah.

1101
00:57:23,413 --> 00:57:25,281
- It was over and now it's--
- Yeah.

1102
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:28,018
Well, I'm glad you two
are on the case.

1103
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:32,422
Who is the girl who is applying
to the internship?

1104
00:57:32,457 --> 00:57:34,024
She looks so familiar to me.

1105
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:37,794
I'll tell you who she looks like.
She looks exactly like--

1106
00:57:42,267 --> 00:57:43,367
- Good show.
- I don't care.

1107
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:45,669
Okay.

1108
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:48,705
- Sorority girl!
- Don't be scared.

1109
00:57:48,739 --> 00:57:51,074
- You're the girl, right?
- I'm Jennifer Johnson.

1110
00:57:51,108 --> 00:57:53,142
- Just graduated Northwestern?
- Stay calm.

1111
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:55,578
- A year early.
- You asked me that moronic question

1112
00:57:55,612 --> 00:57:58,247
and then my world came apart
and she came here

1113
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:00,415
and I landed in the tabloids
and I got death threats

1114
00:58:00,483 --> 00:58:02,451
and my job is constantly
in jeopardy

1115
00:58:02,485 --> 00:58:04,019
and you ruined my life?

1116
00:58:04,053 --> 00:58:06,955
- Again, just stay calm.
- Yes, that was me.

1117
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,623
What the hell
are you doing here?

1118
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:11,426
- I'm applying for an internship.
- Why?

1119
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:14,763
I watch the show

1120
00:58:14,797 --> 00:58:16,699
and I read the
<i>New York Magazine</i> article

1121
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:19,034
and I know
what a greater fool is.

1122
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:20,703
And I want to be one.

1123
00:58:26,343 --> 00:58:28,344
<i>Camelot</i>-- She's the kid
at the end of <i>Camelot</i>.

1124
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:35,685
Ask me again.

1125
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:37,287
I'm sorry?

1126
00:58:37,321 --> 00:58:40,423
Ask me your idiot question again.

1127
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:47,097
What makes America
the greatest country in the world?

1128
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,368
You do.

1129
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:55,572
Hire her.

1130
00:59:01,345 --> 00:59:04,113
What did the rest of the message--

1131
00:59:04,148 --> 00:59:05,715
Screw it.

1132
00:59:05,749 --> 00:59:09,018
I'll just feed him another 10 cookies.

1133
00:59:09,052 --> 00:59:10,819
Welcome to <i>News Night</i>.

1134
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:15,657
- 100 more death threats.
- Yeah.

1135
00:59:15,691 --> 00:59:18,493
- But we're pretty sure they're not serious.
- Not these hundred.

1136
00:59:18,527 --> 00:59:21,896
But after tonight, I expect the next hundred
will be very serious.

1137
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,531
What do you protect me for?

1138
00:59:23,565 --> 00:59:25,900
1,700 a week plus health and dental.

1139
00:59:25,934 --> 00:59:28,569
I wouldn't take a bullet for 1,700 a week.

1140
00:59:28,603 --> 00:59:30,905
Me neither, pal.
So I've learned how to duck.

1141
00:59:50,258 --> 00:59:52,459
<i>Hey, it's me-- Will.</i>

1142
00:59:52,494 --> 00:59:56,029
<i>Listen, I swear I'm not
saying this because I'm high.</i>

1143
00:59:56,064 --> 00:59:58,332
<i>If the answer is no,
then just do me a favor</i>

1144
00:59:58,366 --> 01:00:01,302
<i>and don't call me back
or bring it up or anything.</i>

1145
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:03,971
<i>But I have to tell you--
I mean, after tonight,</i>

1146
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:06,273
<i>I really want to tell you
that I've never stopped--</i>

1147
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:32,910
