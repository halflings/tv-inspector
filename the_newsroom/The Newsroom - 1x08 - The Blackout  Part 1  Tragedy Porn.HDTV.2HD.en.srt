00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,830
<i>I know maybe a dozen reporters,
guys you know, too,</i>

3
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:49,465
<i>who tell me they've been
pitching you this story</i>

4
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,901
for almost a year with no luck.

5
00:01:51,935 --> 00:01:54,237
Yeah, I'm not crazy about
being interviewed in print.

6
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,007
Print journalists play it fast and loose
with exclamation points.

7
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:01,144
I love the news
becomes <i>I love the news!</i>

8
00:02:01,179 --> 00:02:02,946
Suddenly I'm deranged.

9
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,948
- So why now?
- Huh?

10
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:06,350
Why are you agreeing
to this piece now?

11
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:09,020
- <i>You don't happen to have a cigarette?</i>
- No.

12
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:10,888
- Why now?
- Ah, right here.

13
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,090
Why do you want this now?

14
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,394
I want some sort of document about
what we've been trying to do here.

15
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,796
Like the king
at the end of <i>Camelot</i>

16
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,565
telling the boy to run behind the lines
from village to village

17
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,267
telling people about,
you know...

18
00:02:23,302 --> 00:02:24,569
- Camelot.
- Yeah.

19
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,571
I'm asking why
you reached out to me.

20
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,873
Because, your recent complications
notwithstanding,

21
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:31,942
<i>you cover the media better
than anyone out there.</i>

22
00:02:31,976 --> 00:02:35,412
You haven't lost your touch for complimenting
and insulting someone at the same time.

23
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,813
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

24
00:02:36,848 --> 00:02:38,415
But it wasn't meant as an insult,
Brian.

25
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,350
Your life's been in
news magazines,

26
00:02:40,384 --> 00:02:42,252
- and news magazines aren't...
- I know.

27
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,120
As many pages long
as they used to be.

28
00:02:44,155 --> 00:02:45,522
What kind of access
are we talking about?

29
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,958
Here's what I'll offer.
You spend a few days here,

30
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:50,294
talk to whoever you want,
but it's all off the record.

31
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:52,229
- Not even background.
- What good does that do me?

32
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:54,565
If I like how it feels,
then we go ahead.

33
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,268
But I still get to tell you
what can retroactively

34
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,669
go on the record from
the tryout period.

35
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:01,371
- You're asking me to audition?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:02,806
Why would I do that?

37
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,375
I can think of some reasons.

38
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,178
Four years ago, you were on
the masthead at <i>Newsweek</i>,

39
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:09,146
turning out ten
cover stories a year

40
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,081
and spending Sunday
mornings on TV.

41
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:12,650
Today you have a blog.

42
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,485
Your fucking disdain
for the Internet--

43
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,020
Is matched only by your
fucking disdain for the Internet.

44
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,489
You took a buyout when
<i>Newsweek</i> was sold to IAC

45
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:23,159
and rolled the money into a start-up,
thinking you'd be the next <i>Huffington Post</i>.

46
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:24,326
How'd it work out?

47
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:25,795
We filed for bankruptcy.

48
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,830
The <i>Sunday Times Magazine</i>,
<i>Vanity Fair</i>,

49
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:30,199
<i>GQ</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>,
<i>The Atlantic</i>--

50
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,135
Everybody's offered the cover
and I get to pick the writer.

51
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,571
I'm going with <i>New York Magazine</i> and you.

52
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:38,541
So, you okay with the audition?

53
00:03:38,576 --> 00:03:40,477
Are you prepared to talk
about your Republicanism?

54
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,179
You say that
like I've got polio.

55
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:43,714
Are you prepared to talk
about having polio?

56
00:03:43,748 --> 00:03:47,551
I grew up in a town outside of town
outside Lincoln, Nebraska.

57
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,086
My hometown was a road.

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,655
I was a college freshman
before I met a Democrat.

59
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,559
What about our history?

60
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,929
Brian, your problem with me
back in the day

61
00:03:57,963 --> 00:04:00,331
was that I was a moderate,
sane Republican

62
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,868
who refused to take a position on anything
for fear I would lose viewers.

63
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,204
Just as moderate,
sane Republicans on the Hill

64
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:09,006
refuse to take a position for fear
they'll lose primary voters.

65
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,210
I had a nightly rundown that went
out of its way to avoid reporting the news.

66
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:14,512
And then Mackenzie McHale
came along

67
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,847
and I'm attacking my own party

68
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,682
for not standing up
to its attackers.

69
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,518
Isn't that what you wanted me to do
back when you were calling me a coward?

70
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,653
Yeah, but that's not
the history I'm talking about

71
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:26,656
and you already knew that,
so please stop fucking around with me.

72
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,729
One parenthetical sentence
in the second graph.

73
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:34,365
"Full disclosure.
I've been a friend of Mackenzie McHale's

74
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,266
- since the late '90s."
- And you?

75
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,802
An email went to 178,000 people

76
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,737
and was reported on
our own morning show.

77
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:43,506
That's all you know
and that's all you'll report.

78
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:46,742
That's fine with me.
But that's the last time

79
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,377
you'll tell me what
I will or won't report.

80
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:51,647
- I'm not your stenographer.
- Do we have a deal?

81
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:54,783
Yeah, now why do you need
someone to run from village to village?

82
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:56,318
Is something about
to happen to Camelot?

83
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:57,619
Maybe.

84
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,189
First, you have to learn
what our whole philosophy is.

85
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:04,026
Hang out, we'll talk later.
I have to go to a meeting with Reese Lansing.

86
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,128
What's it about?

87
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:08,298
Suspending our whole philosophy.

88
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,500
Good to see you again, Brian.

89
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,339
He should be here any minute.

90
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:22,511
Sorry I'm late.

91
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:24,681
All right, I'm not gonna tell you
what to put on the air.

92
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:27,083
You're not allowed to tell us
what to put on the air.

93
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:30,452
So I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

94
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,288
You got mugged last week.
You got bludgeoned.

95
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:36,292
- It's Casey Anthony.
<i>- Hang on, wait. She may just be right.</i>

96
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,494
- We knew we'd take a small hit.
- There's nothing small.

97
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,097
Let me just give you the facts and then
invite you to draw your own conclusion.

98
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:45,035
Nancy Grace averages 283,000
viewers on HLN.

99
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,003
Her time period
competitor <i>News Night</i>

100
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,406
averages 960,000.

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,943
<i>One week ago, HLN begins coverage
of the Casey Anthony trial</i>

102
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,914
and Nancy's audience increases
to 1.5 million viewers

103
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:59,349
while <i>News Night</i>'s audience
drops to 460,000,

104
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:02,486
sending you from second to fifth place
in the course of five days.

105
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,356
A feat I previously thought
was only accomplishable

106
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,125
by the New York Mets.

107
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,228
Whose idea was it to not cover
the Casey Anthony trial?

108
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:12,963
It was mine.

109
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,132
I think the three of you
should have a vaudeville act.

110
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,068
I'm not kidding.
I'm gonna send you on a fucking tour.

111
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:20,237
It was hers.

112
00:06:20,272 --> 00:06:23,540
Mackenzie, I've never seen
a more vivid picture of why viewers left,

113
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:25,075
where they went to, and why.

114
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,276
You said why twice.

115
00:06:26,311 --> 00:06:28,245
<i>You chose not to work for PBS.</i>

116
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,381
You chose not to work for NPR.
You have a ratings obligation.

117
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,250
No, you have
a ratings obligation.

118
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:35,018
You're in business
with the advertisers.

119
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:36,820
I'm in business
with the viewers.

120
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,455
You just lost their business.

121
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,762
That's all.

122
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,497
<i>Do what you want
with the information.</i>

123
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:54,870
I'll not be taken down by this
psychotic cocktail waitress.

124
00:06:54,904 --> 00:06:58,006
That's right, we just keep playing our game,
wait it out and just...

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,741
How long can the trial go on?

126
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:01,876
I've seen the witness list.
It'll run around six weeks

127
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:03,945
plus summations plus deliberation.

128
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:05,914
- We'll never make it.
- That's right, so--

129
00:07:05,948 --> 00:07:08,116
Wait, when you said
we wouldn't be taken down

130
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,784
by this psychotic
cocktail waitress,

131
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:12,620
did you mean we weren't
gonna cave or that we were?

132
00:07:12,654 --> 00:07:15,590
- You're gonna cover Casey Anthony.
- Bullshit we are.

133
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,459
We have the three-day weekend
to gear up for it.

134
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:21,063
- Charlie.
- Starting Tuesday, you'll lead with her in the A block.

135
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,234
Give it 15 minutes and a five-minute reset
on the half hour.

136
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:26,102
Seriously, I can't tell
if you're joking or--

137
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,370
- Did you just hear those numbers?
- Yes.

138
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,039
Half our audience
changed the channel in one week.

139
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,908
- I understand.
<i>- Do you?</i>

140
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,945
- Do I understand math?
- Do you understand that it's unprecedented?

141
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,813
I'm not gonna argue with you
when Will can do it for me.

142
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:39,349
He's never gonna go for this.
Tell him.

143
00:07:39,383 --> 00:07:42,852
Have marketing promo the living shit
out of Casey Anthony.

144
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,066
Oh, my God.

145
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,622
Rename the show <i>Casey Anthony Night
with Casey Anthony</i>.

146
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:47,491
- Will, hang on.
- Right here on the Casey Anthony Network.

147
00:07:47,525 --> 00:07:49,393
- Mac.
- 'Cause any second I'm going to wake up

148
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,663
and be back in a room with Don Quixote
and the mission to civilize.

149
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:54,932
- Listen to me.
- No. How many drinks were thrown in your face

150
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:56,667
because you didn't think
people should be watching

151
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:58,936
<i>The Real Morons of South Beach</i>
or whatever the hell it's called?

152
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,338
- It's not the same thing.
- It's exactly the same thing.

153
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:03,774
It's just worse.
A child is dead.

154
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:06,677
A very troubled young mother
either did or didn't murder her.

155
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,845
Her parents are waiting to find out
if their daughter's going to get the needle.

156
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,015
So thank God for TiVo,
otherwise we wouldn't be able to sit down--

157
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:15,218
- It's news.
- Yeah, say that three times and click your heels.

158
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:16,787
It's entertainment.

159
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:19,456
And it's just--
Just this side of a snuff film.

160
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,358
- Sit down, Mac.
- No, I don't want to sit.

161
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,794
- Do it anyway, please.
- 15 at the top, that's a quarter of the show.

162
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:25,662
- <i>Mac.</i>
- And five at the bottom for a reset?

163
00:08:25,697 --> 00:08:27,364
Please sit!

164
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,535
- Think I like it?
- I know you don't.

165
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,238
It makes me sick.
There isn't enough bourbon in Kentucky.

166
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:36,474
Okay?
We're in the same place on this.

167
00:08:36,508 --> 00:08:40,078
So let's be in the same place on this.

168
00:08:40,113 --> 00:08:41,613
We've had ratings dips before.

169
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:44,016
First of all, not like this.
Nothing like this.

170
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,220
<i>Second, I want the debate.
The three of us have talked about a new debate format</i>

171
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:50,357
for months and we're not going to be able
to do it if they don't give us a debate.

172
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,159
- I just really--
- They're not gonna give us a debate

173
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:54,461
if we're in fifth place.
I want the debate.

174
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,329
I want to fundamentally
change the way

175
00:08:56,364 --> 00:08:58,198
we interview presidential
candidates for their job.

176
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:00,166
<i>If that means we have
to be Jerry Springer</i>

177
00:09:00,201 --> 00:09:02,001
for a few weeks,
I'm willing to pay that price.

178
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:04,904
When the going gets tough,
the two of you really man up.

179
00:09:04,939 --> 00:09:07,474
Then go with your principles,
Mac, but know

180
00:09:07,508 --> 00:09:09,776
a ratings hit like this
is all Leona needs

181
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,413
to fire Will without
having to explain why.

182
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,361
- All right.
<i>- You'll do it as classy as you can.</i>

183
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,331
I'll have Will wear
a top hat and monocle

184
00:09:29,366 --> 00:09:32,334
while he's showing pictures
of the wet T-shirt contest.

185
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,340
I'm sorry about
the outburst in there.

186
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,143
Yeah, I'm not sure it was
all about Casey Anthony.

187
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,314
- How did it go?
- He's doing it.

188
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:47,283
Then he has to disclose
that we were--

189
00:09:47,317 --> 00:09:49,518
I told him one parenthetical
in the second graph.

190
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:50,786
That's it.

191
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,755
He needs to be seen
as a heavyweight again, Mac.

192
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,723
He's not gonna write a tell-all.
You're fine.

193
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,394
Murrow did <i>Person to Person</i>.

194
00:09:59,428 --> 00:10:01,663
Celebrity interviews.
It was a deal with Paley.

195
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,398
One for them, one for him.

196
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:05,166
He interviewed Liberace, Mac,

197
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,568
just so he could keep
going after McCarthy.

198
00:10:07,603 --> 00:10:09,937
Those were puff pieces.
This is poison.

199
00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:13,540
If we're gonna do this,
let's not pretend we're not doing this.

200
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,812
- Jim Harper.
- Hey.

201
00:10:18,846 --> 00:10:20,414
- Brian Brenner.
- I know.

202
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:22,950
I wasn't sure if you remembered.
It's been a few years.

203
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:25,019
Sure.
It's good to see you.

204
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,921
Are you looking at
BigGoverment.com?

205
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:28,556
- Yeah.
- Don't make me write

206
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:31,893
that you're using Andrew Breitbart
to research this show.

207
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:34,896
No, we're gonna be doing a mock debate
at the end of next week.

208
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,201
- A mock debate?
- The RNC is looking at Will to possibly host a debate,

209
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:42,004
and Will and Mac have an idea
for a new debate format.

210
00:10:42,038 --> 00:10:44,140
We want to show them,
so we're each playing a candidate

211
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:47,477
and we're gonna do a mock debate
on Michele Bachmann, so...

212
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,812
- Andrew Breitbart.
- Yeah.

213
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,114
Tell me about this new
debate format you guys want.

214
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,920
You know, I'm not really sure what
I'm allowed to talk to you about yet.

215
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,088
Do you mind if we wait until
I get some instructions?

216
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,423
- Sure.
- Thanks.

217
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,297
Hey.

218
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,565
- Hey.
- I heard you were here.

219
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:08,933
You're not getting out
of town for the weekend?

220
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:10,601
- Nope. How about you?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,404
I'm going to a think tank conference
outside Baltimore.

222
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:15,773
The Institute For Capital
Studies and Economic Growth.

223
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,576
- It's gonna be a raver.
- I think it's called a rager.

224
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,144
- Are you sure?
- No.

225
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:22,880
It's either a rave
or a rager or a raver.

226
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:26,184
Don't think the Institute For Capital Studies
and Economic Growth's gonna be any of them.

227
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,752
So I stopped in
to give you a heads up.

228
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,187
I might need a couple extra minutes
Tuesday night.

229
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,956
I don't think I can give it to you.

230
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,124
The House is going to vote up or down
on increasing the debt ceiling.

231
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,460
- It's a cosmetic vote, but--
- If it's a cosmetic vote, why--

232
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,696
It's news because first of all,
it'll be the first time

233
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,764
in history the House lets
the US default on its debt.

234
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,767
But moreover,
it'll be the first shot

235
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,368
in the beginning
of a very reckless,

236
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:47,172
extremely dangerous partisan fight
that could end in catastrophe.

237
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,007
- Let me explain.
- I can't give you the time.

238
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,709
- If Congress doesn't raise--
- I can't give you the extra time.

239
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:55,180
Starting Tuesday,
I have to cover Casey Anthony.

240
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,251
- I really liked that we weren't doing that.
- I really liked it, too.

241
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,420
By putting the debt ceiling vote in the A block,
we'd be sending--

242
00:12:02,454 --> 00:12:05,857
I can't, Sloan.
We lost half our audience last week.

243
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,359
That's not hyperbole.
That's an actual number.

244
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,163
- Half our audience went to HLN at 8:00.
- Half?

245
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,698
If we don't bring them home this week,
we'll have lost most of them for good

246
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,000
and we could lose the debate.

247
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,969
Kenzie, I'm not just trying
to get more airtime.

248
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,370
This is an incredibly important--

249
00:12:20,405 --> 00:12:22,906
I had 42 and a half minutes
to work with.

250
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:24,541
I now have 22 and a half.

251
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:26,109
Do you know how you're gonna
budget the 22 and a half?

252
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:27,444
Do you know what
Tuesday's news is?

253
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:29,846
We want the debate.
That's the prize.

254
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,249
Those guys are studying on a Friday night
of a three-day weekend.

255
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,551
- Okay, next question.
- Congresswoman Bachmann,

256
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:38,954
you're a proponent of reforming
Social Security and Medicare.

257
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:41,023
Can you give us some details
of the reforms you have in mind?

258
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:44,126
I'd start by reducing benefits for
all but current recipients

259
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,228
as part of an effort to
reduce the federal deficit.

260
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:49,064
I'd like to add that President Obama
has already transferred

261
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:52,267
over $500 billion out of Medicare
and into Obamacare,

262
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:54,169
which I will repeal
on my first day in office.

263
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:57,071
Ms. Bachmann, are you aware
that presidents can't repeal laws?

264
00:12:57,106 --> 00:13:00,575
I, Jim, am aware of that,
but...

265
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:01,910
Where are you
getting the quote?

266
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,679
BigGovernment.com.
It's right here.

267
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,316
- Hmm.
- What?

268
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,020
Anthony Weiner's
Twitter account got hacked.

269
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:14,355
- Can I suggest a way to turn lemons into lemonade?
- Sure.

270
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,057
First you squeeze the juice from the lemons.
Then add sugar and water.

271
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,726
And you're not really into this joke,
so I'm just going to say what I really wanted to say.

272
00:13:19,761 --> 00:13:22,829
The Casey Anthony story
actually gives us a chance to show

273
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:24,931
how important the
debt ceiling story is if we lead

274
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,465
with the debt ceiling
instead of Casey Anthony.

275
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,367
When do you have
to go to your raver?

276
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,035
- I've got plenty of time.
- Tea, can I have another?

277
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,438
- Yeah.
- Hey, how about Brian Brenner?

278
00:13:32,472 --> 00:13:34,373
I've been reading him for years
and didn't know what he looked like.

279
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,909
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

280
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:37,310
- Is he single?
- He is.

281
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,744
- Are you interested?
- Nope.

282
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:41,781
That's contempt prior
to investigation.

283
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,450
No, it's contempt after
thorough investigation.

284
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:46,085
- You dated him?
- I did.

285
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,489
- When?
- About six years ago.

286
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:50,656
That's-- Wait.

287
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,625
- That's--
- Yeah.

288
00:13:54,295 --> 00:13:56,863
Six years ago, you were with
the guy you were with before Will.

289
00:13:56,898 --> 00:13:59,366
Yeah.

290
00:14:01,403 --> 00:14:03,137
- But that would--
- Oh, my God, Sloan.

291
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:04,872
It's like the land
where time stands still.

292
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:07,509
Brian Brenner is the guy
I cheated on Will with.

293
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:12,848
I'd been with Will for a year
and Brian started calling me again.

294
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,150
- Wow.
- Yeah.

295
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,286
- Why would he do the piece?
- Brian?

296
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
- Yeah.
- He needs a cover story.

297
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:19,921
And why would Will
have Brian do the piece?

298
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:22,390
That's a perfectly fair question
to which I have no answer.

299
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:25,160
This is really messed up.

300
00:14:25,194 --> 00:14:29,197
Look, I'll do my best to find you
the time you need for the story.

301
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,000
We just need to hope there's
no new piece of nonsense

302
00:14:32,034 --> 00:14:36,270
I have to jam into my 22 minutes
of Short Attention Span Theater.

303
00:14:36,304 --> 00:14:38,172
Anthony Weiner accidently tweeted

304
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,741
a picture of his groin
to 40,000 followers.

305
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,681
<i>And I don't consider it
that big a federal offense,</i>

306
00:14:47,715 --> 00:14:50,284
but people want to pay attention
to it and I guess I get it.

307
00:14:50,318 --> 00:14:52,119
When you're named Weiner,
it kind of goes with the territory.

308
00:14:52,154 --> 00:14:54,088
Have you ever taken a picture
like this of yourself?

309
00:14:54,122 --> 00:14:56,556
<i>I can tell you this,
that there are--</i>

310
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,225
I have photographs.

311
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,728
I don't know what photographs
are out there in the world of me.

312
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,531
<i>I don't know what things have
been manipulated and doctored.</i>

313
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,634
<i>And we're gonna try
to find out what happened.</i>

314
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:09,537
<i>But the most important reason I want to
find out what happened is to make sure...</i>

315
00:15:09,571 --> 00:15:13,841
Weiner, McAvoy. Call me.
You're getting terrible advice.

316
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,245
Well, the choices are to
do something or to do nothing.

317
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,714
If we do nothing, then the audience
turns to the nearest guy doing something.

318
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,950
What exactly
would our report be?

319
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,052
That he's not answering
questions very well?

320
00:15:26,086 --> 00:15:28,087
- I don't know. Give me three minutes.
- To report what?

321
00:15:28,121 --> 00:15:31,056
I don't know. But if I do nothing,
it's gonna look like I'm protecting a liberal.

322
00:15:31,091 --> 00:15:33,859
Since when did we start caring about
what it looks like instead of what it is?

323
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,495
Reports on the Tea Party won't
have credibility if we're not balanced.

324
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,898
Will, you're the one
who said that balance

325
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,267
for its own sake doesn't
have any place in reporting.

326
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:46,037
One from column A and one
from column B is bullshit.

327
00:15:46,072 --> 00:15:50,008
And boorish behavior isn't the same as
taking the US Treasury hostage.

328
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:53,244
And when the RNC boys come here on Friday,
they won't see it the same way.

329
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,047
And you'll explain to them we
don't care that he's sexting.

330
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,050
- We care how he votes.
- And they'll understand, give us the debate,

331
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:02,420
let us use the format we want,
and we'll all go out for chocolate milk shakes.

332
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:05,856
Three minutes in the B block,
please, after Casey Anthony.

333
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,724
Okay.

334
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,760
I know it seems like
a story that only affects

335
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:13,730
300,000 people in Queens,
but since there's sex involved,

336
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,233
we can't deny
its national importance.

337
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:20,104
Especially since we don't know
all or even any of the facts.

338
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:25,444
Three minutes.
I assume you want the pictures.

339
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:28,580
Good meeting.

340
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:36,422
I'm pretty familiar
with that tone of voice.

341
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:39,226
- I guess you are, too?
- I am.

342
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:45,765
No one's been hitting the Tea Party
as hard as you've been.

343
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,968
- Certainly no Republican.
- That's not true.

344
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,670
David Frum, Mark McKinnon,
Alan Simpson,

345
00:16:50,704 --> 00:16:52,005
Steve Schmidt, Andrew Sullivan.

346
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,107
Okay, but none of them
work for Leona Lansing.

347
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:56,343
I don't know.
I think everybody works for Leona Lansing.

348
00:16:56,378 --> 00:17:00,147
She can't be happy that you're beating up
people AWM needs on the Hill.

349
00:17:00,181 --> 00:17:02,683
I'm really not an expert on what
does or doesn't make Leona happy.

350
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:04,818
Has she ever asked you
to tone it down?

351
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,154
I'm not doing your
reporting for you, Brian.

352
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:09,690
I'm doing my reporting myself.
I'm asking you a question.

353
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:13,294
I'm not commenting on or off the record
about either Leona or Reese Lansing.

354
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:16,531
- Does she want you fired?
- If she wanted me fired, I'd be fired.

355
00:17:16,565 --> 00:17:18,566
All she has to do
is buy my contract,

356
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,701
which she can do with the money
under her sofa cushion.

357
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:22,737
But then she'd have to explain
why she was firing

358
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:25,040
the second most watched
anchor on cable

359
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,975
and she can't do that.

360
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,778
Is it a coincidence that
the tabloid stories about you

361
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:31,146
started right after
the election?

362
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,182
I don't know.

363
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:36,284
Do you think she's using
her own tabloid magazine

364
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,819
to manufacture
a reason to fire you?

365
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,954
That would be
a smart way to do it.

366
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:42,123
And, of course,
if you lost half your audience

367
00:17:42,157 --> 00:17:45,092
because your show was too highbrow
to cover Casey Anthony,

368
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,861
she wouldn't even need to
work that hard to do it.

369
00:17:46,895 --> 00:17:50,564
Firing an anchor for losing half his audience
isn't unreasonable,

370
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,099
if that's what you're asking.

371
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,134
It wasn't and you know it.

372
00:17:56,203 --> 00:17:59,239
You're trying to get me to write this story
without your fingerprints on it.

373
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:03,543
AWM has to do business with Congress
and you're making it much harder.

374
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:06,579
Leona wants you fired,
but can't do it unless she can explain it.

375
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:09,181
She's hoping the tabloid stories
build to a critical mass

376
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,750
or that your ratings tank.

377
00:18:11,785 --> 00:18:14,386
Say something if I'm wrong,
say nothing if I'm right.

378
00:18:18,225 --> 00:18:20,594
For what it's worth,
I'd cave, too.

379
00:18:20,628 --> 00:18:25,666
No serious journalist would ever agree
to the demands I made on Friday.

380
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,101
So for what it's worth,
you already did.

381
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:33,241
Are you ready to answer questions
about the newsletter?

382
00:18:33,275 --> 00:18:35,877
- I haven't read it.
- The mock debate's Friday.

383
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,313
No, I'm being Ron Paul right now.
I didn't write it.

384
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,548
I've never read it.
I've never heard it.

385
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,683
It's got my name on it,
I've made money from it.

386
00:18:41,718 --> 00:18:44,219
The newsletters would
get a standing ovation at a Klan rally,

387
00:18:44,254 --> 00:18:46,321
but you should stop asking me
questions about them.

388
00:18:46,356 --> 00:18:48,423
- You need a better answer.
- He needs a better answer.

389
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:51,093
Tell you what question
I'd start off with.

390
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:53,362
- Congresswoman Bachmann.
- Yes?

391
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:56,231
You've said that you were told
to run for president by God.

392
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,066
- Please, I don't--
- You have, right?

393
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,335
You've said on a number of occasions
that God told you to run for president.

394
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,504
I have some clips here if you'd
like me to refresh your memory.

395
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:05,238
- Nope, my memory is fresh.
- Here's my question.

396
00:19:05,273 --> 00:19:07,107
- Good.
- What does God's voice sound like?

397
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:09,676
I'm completely serious.

398
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,445
She's saying that
God spoke directly to her.

399
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,147
How is this not the first question
asked in a debate?

400
00:19:14,182 --> 00:19:15,916
<i>How's it not the only question?</i>

401
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,686
What does His voice sound like?

402
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,723
What did He say
exactly word for word?

403
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:25,527
Did He speak in Hebrew?
Acadian? Kiswahili-Bantu?

404
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,264
And to put it in a medical context,
is this the first time you've heard voices?

405
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:31,533
She's claiming to be a prophet.

406
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,602
<i>The whole world is sitting
on the edge of their seat.</i>

407
00:19:33,636 --> 00:19:36,105
How is this not the first
question we'll ask?

408
00:19:36,139 --> 00:19:39,041
First of all, can you stop pointing at me
and saying she and her?

409
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,210
You're the one
who wanted to play a woman.

410
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:42,812
But tell me why that
question is out of line.

411
00:19:42,846 --> 00:19:45,482
Because it's not the best way
to demonstrate seriousness of intent

412
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,484
and it's not the best way
not to insult people.

413
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:50,253
- Which people?
- Christians. 83% of the country.

414
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,723
I'm one of them.
And she's insulting me.

415
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,658
Please, stop pointing at me
when you are--

416
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,595
Relax, J. Edgar.
She's insulting me,

417
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,498
she's insulting my family,
she's insulting my congregation,

418
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,933
and she's insulting my faith.

419
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,235
<i>She's implying that
Christians are imbeciles</i>

420
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,605
who will believe anything
while reducing God

421
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,274
to a party hack who endorses
political candidates.

422
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,611
Now, maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe this is the first time since Moses

423
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,915
that God has given direct instructions
to someone other than His son.

424
00:20:15,949 --> 00:20:18,217
But if so, I think
it deserves a follow-up.

425
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:20,553
We're not going to get the debate
if we're mocking their candidates.

426
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,788
The whole point
of the new debate format

427
00:20:22,823 --> 00:20:24,657
is to compel the candidates
to tell the truth

428
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:26,793
and make them responsible
for their own rhetoric

429
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:29,528
by asking tougher questions
than a Match.com profile.

430
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:33,165
If she knows what God wants,
then I'm voting for her.

431
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,201
If she doesn't,
she should stop saying so.

432
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,403
I'm not attacking Christians.
I'm defending them.

433
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:39,338
- All right.
- Just a moment, please.

434
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,241
- <i>What?</i>
- I'm standing up for the tens of millions of Christians

435
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:45,644
who are tired of being represented
by having our identity--

436
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,580
There's been an identity theft.

437
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,782
That's it.
That's the one I want.

438
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,686
<i>I think you already know
that starting tonight,</i>

439
00:20:53,721 --> 00:20:55,988
we're leading with Casey Anthony.

440
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,490
Does anyone have
a problem with that?

441
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,460
All right, well,
we lost almost half a million viewers

442
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,128
to Nancy Grace last week.

443
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,063
Does anyone still have
a problem with it?

444
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,633
<i>We're gonna clear out some of
these stories to make room.</i>

445
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,603
"Senate obstruction
become worst in US history."

446
00:21:12,637 --> 00:21:14,705
That's a report
by the Alliance For Justice.

447
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,709
The Senate's confirmed a smaller percentage
of Obama's judicial appointees

448
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,610
than any other Senate
and any other president.

449
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,013
No reason to care about that.

450
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:25,383
"Job situation dire,
new stimulus needed."

451
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,319
This Congress ran on jobs,
but they're focused on debt.

452
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,789
According to the payroll
company ADP--

453
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,425
I just solved unemployment.

454
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,829
"AFL-CIO sours on Obama."

455
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:40,027
We've got an analyst
lined up to give a report card

456
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:41,395
on Obama's union relationship.

457
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:43,730
Will the AFL-CIO still be
sour on him tomorrow?

458
00:21:43,765 --> 00:21:46,967
- I don't know.
- Let's find out.

459
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:50,637
All right, to give us
a crash course in how best

460
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:52,772
to exploit this tragedy
and to erase all boundaries

461
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:54,874
<i>of what should be used
as entertainment,</i>

462
00:21:54,908 --> 00:21:58,477
I've enlisted the help
of a master of the dark arts.

463
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:01,146
I understand I'm needed.

464
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,182
- Thank you.
- Forget everything you know about the news.

465
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:06,384
Done.
What's next?

466
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,684
I'm Charlie Skinner.

467
00:22:40,718 --> 00:22:42,586
Good to meet you.

468
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,888
Should I just sit here?

469
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:47,524
Sure.

470
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,927
Should I call you Mr. Hancock?

471
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:51,762
It's Schneider.

472
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,864
- Schneider?
- Ezra Schneider.

473
00:22:53,898 --> 00:22:56,433
How the hell many aliases
do you have?

474
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:57,835
I beg your pardon?

475
00:22:57,869 --> 00:22:59,937
Are you Late For Dinner?

476
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,907
Mister, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

477
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,209
Charlie.

478
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,114
That has to have been
strange for you.

479
00:23:10,129 --> 00:23:11,749
Late For Dinner?

480
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,668
- Solomon Hancock.
- Charlie Skinner.

481
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:17,371
I thought because of
the carnation--

482
00:23:17,405 --> 00:23:19,340
Did we say anything
about a carnation?

483
00:23:19,374 --> 00:23:23,078
No, but it's usually
the international sign for--

484
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:24,679
It doesn't matter.

485
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,681
I'm a busy guy and if
you're faffin' me around...

486
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:28,616
Would you mind taking
the battery out of your cell phone?

487
00:23:28,651 --> 00:23:31,853
The walls in the New York Public Library
are three feet thick.

488
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:33,554
That's why we're meeting here.
But I'd like you

489
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:35,523
to take the battery
out of your cell phone.

490
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:37,325
You have reason to believe
you're under surveillance?

491
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,694
Everyone's under surveillance.
If you've got a cell phone--

492
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,362
It's talk like that
that makes me--

493
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:44,031
Did I or did I not
establish credibility on May 1st?

494
00:23:44,065 --> 00:23:48,035
You correctly predicted that
we'd all be called to work, yes.

495
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:51,338
Sometimes at the NSA,
we download a rolling bug

496
00:23:51,372 --> 00:23:54,541
onto smartphones
to slave the microphone.

497
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:57,144
You ever get
an unwanted text message?

498
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,746
All the time,
but they're from my boss.

499
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:02,616
Here.

500
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,785
I'll never be able
to put that back together.

501
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,854
They're coming out with a better model
in six months.

502
00:24:07,888 --> 00:24:09,955
That's unusual
for the tech industry.

503
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,426
Can you tell me
a little about yourself?

504
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,896
I started out chasing around
a Soviet Pacific Fleet

505
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,765
doing signal intelligence cryptology
for the Navy.

506
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,303
But when the Berlin Wall came down,
my war was over.

507
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:27,540
So I went into the private sector
like everybody else in the '90s,

508
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:28,942
only not for a dot-com,

509
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,245
doing data compression
for fiber optics.

510
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,082
Then 9/11 happened
and I decided

511
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,751
it was a good time to get back
into public service hunting bad guys.

512
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:38,852
You're an IT guy.

513
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:41,856
My title is Assistant Deputy Director

514
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,559
of Technology and Systems,
Cryptology, and Mathematics at NSA.

515
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,065
I'm gonna have to--

516
00:24:54,237 --> 00:24:56,305
I product test software.

517
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:58,807
- NSA software?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,076
Can you tell me
about the software?

519
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:03,946
It's data mining.

520
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,782
One of the ways the NSA
was tracking bin Laden,

521
00:25:06,817 --> 00:25:08,484
or any terrorist for that matter,

522
00:25:08,518 --> 00:25:11,753
was to write code
that would sift through

523
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:13,755
millions of electronic
communications

524
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,824
looking for a needle
in a giant haystack.

525
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:18,960
You know the machine
that Batman uses in <i>The Dark Knight</i>

526
00:25:18,994 --> 00:25:21,395
to find the Joker,
but when Morgan Freeman finds out about it,

527
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,465
he says, "I'm quitting because
no man should have this much power"?

528
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:27,467
- No.
- No what?

529
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:31,405
- I do not know that machine.
- Well, it exists.

530
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:34,746
We gave the contract to
two defense contracting big boys

531
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,181
and it was my job mostly to
make sure that they delivered

532
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:38,716
and that it worked.

533
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:41,453
The project title
is GLOBAL CLARITY

534
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:45,491
and it intercepts
1.7 billion phone calls,

535
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:47,626
emails, and texts every day.

536
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:49,462
- Legally?
- By what standard?

537
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:51,497
- The law.
- No.

538
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:53,933
It involves a significant
amount of illegal,

539
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,202
warrantless wiretapping
of American citizens.

540
00:25:56,236 --> 00:25:59,371
Just to be--
When you say warrantless,

541
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:01,273
are you saying unnecessary?

542
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:04,177
Without a warrant.
Warrantless.

543
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:06,479
We could hunt
for terrorists legally,

544
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:09,348
but due to our bosses'
devotion to GLOBAL CLARITY,

545
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:13,019
the NSA has been happily
violating the Fourth Amendment,

546
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:14,954
USSID 18,

547
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:19,425
and about a dozen of the NSA's
own regulations about spying on Americans.

548
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,629
You've got guys
listening in on ex-wives,

549
00:26:22,663 --> 00:26:25,365
dropping in on calls
from soldiers overseas,

550
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,567
checking out what
movie stars are up to.

551
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:29,803
Am I the first person
you've talked to about this?

552
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:33,140
No, stop confusing me
with Donald Sutherland in <i>JFK</i>.

553
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,941
Well, a second ago,
you were Morgan Freeman.

554
00:26:34,976 --> 00:26:36,943
I have testified
in front of Congress

555
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:39,846
and to the Pentagon Inspector General.
I got nowhere.

556
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,149
Nobody on the Hill
wants to admit it's fucked up

557
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:46,286
because nobody wants to
be seen as post-9/11 soft.

558
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:48,889
Where does AWM come in?

559
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:51,492
Atlantis World Media
owns Atlantis Cable News.

560
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,629
- Yeah.
- It also owns the tabloid <i>TMI</i>.

561
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:57,632
- Yeah.
- The shit that's happening

562
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,768
at Murdoch's <i>News of the World</i> in London,

563
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:02,271
<i>TMI</i> has been doing
the same thing for years.

564
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:05,474
- How high does it go?
- I don't know.

565
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:07,743
Does it go as high as Leona Lansing?

566
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,378
- No.
- Good.

567
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,047
It goes as high as her son.

568
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:15,584
<i>TMI</i> is doing phone
and computer hacking

569
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:17,219
and Reese Lansing knows?

570
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,421
Reese has been ordering it.

571
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:22,257
- I'm gonna give you--
- Hang on.

572
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,292
I need to digest that.

573
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:28,229
Reese Lansing is James Murdoch,

574
00:27:28,263 --> 00:27:30,898
but Lansing's been ordering it.

575
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:33,601
Digested yet?

576
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:40,374
These classified?

577
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,343
Yeah, because I'm dying
to violate the Espionage Act.

578
00:27:42,377 --> 00:27:45,013
These are just transcripts
of my testimony

579
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,716
before the House subcommittee
and the Pentagon.

580
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,453
Vet me, vet the material.
Take all the time you need.

581
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:53,555
Why are you whistle-blowing?

582
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:57,225
I fought the Soviets.

583
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,827
The way their government
made their people live their lives

584
00:27:59,861 --> 00:28:02,430
was a very good reason
to fight them.

585
00:28:02,464 --> 00:28:04,665
After 9/11,

586
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,335
we started doing
the exact same thing.

587
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,438
I didn't spend my life
fighting Communists

588
00:28:10,472 --> 00:28:12,373
to have it come to this.

589
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:14,876
Report on GLOBAL CLARITY.

590
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,145
And once I see that report,
I'll give you what you need

591
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:19,080
to protect yourself
from Leona Lansing.

592
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:22,050
How do you know we need
protecting from Leona Lansing?

593
00:28:22,084 --> 00:28:24,986
Have you been listening?
'Cause we have.

594
00:28:44,873 --> 00:28:47,474
<i>This woman is the best I've ever seen.</i>

595
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:49,310
<i>Center screen is Nancy.</i>

596
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:51,479
These three corners are
live feeds of the guest experts.

597
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,881
- What are they experts in?
- Agreeing with everything Nancy says.

598
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:55,683
- <i>But what keeps your atten--</i>
- Excuse me.

599
00:28:57,586 --> 00:28:59,621
This is Brian Brenner,
everyone.

600
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,923
<i>It's possible he's going to be
writing a feature on 2.0.</i>

601
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,292
But we're in a
tryout period right now.

602
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,727
<i>Everything's off the record.</i>

603
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:07,896
Go ahead.
What keeps our attention?

604
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,464
Is the bottom right corner
where they're playing

605
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:11,800
a loop of little Caylee
from a home video.

606
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:15,571
Question: Hell.
Do you think it's as bad as everyone says it is?

607
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:18,341
That was a tribute to Caylee.

608
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:21,678
But how will they
explain the duct tape

609
00:29:21,712 --> 00:29:24,014
around the child's
mouth and nose?

610
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,415
And how will they explain

611
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:28,752
<i>all the lies that Tot Mom told?</i>

612
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,620
Now they're not talking
about the tattoo

613
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,755
on Casey's back,
but they put it full screen. Why?

614
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,590
Because Tess was just about
to look somewhere else,

615
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,625
so they changed the frame to anything
that might keep her attention.

616
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,227
He's right.
I was gonna Google Mac's hell question.

617
00:29:39,262 --> 00:29:40,695
Plus tattoo equals bad mom.

618
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,631
No one's ever gone broke
in America serving up

619
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,099
a woman who makes other
women feel superior.

620
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:46,234
<i>The series of lies</i>

621
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,970
that finally came
crashing down around her.

622
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,972
If she would lie about that,

623
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,440
why should I believe
an accident is true?

624
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,642
Don't spend time thinking
about her airtight syllogism.

625
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:57,978
Her EP's showing duct tape
and a plastic bag,

626
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,714
so you know you're watching
the real <i>CSI Miami</i>.

627
00:30:00,748 --> 00:30:02,716
How to make weapons

628
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,585
out of home materials
found in the home.

629
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,087
About breaking necks.

630
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:10,456
<i>How can they explain that?</i>

631
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,825
They can't explain it, Nancy.

632
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,229
The defense is doing what
the defense has to do.

633
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:18,731
<i>Now, Bill Sheaffer
has done his job.</i>

634
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:21,267
He agreed with Nancy.
We don't need to see his face anymore.

635
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,503
Look how cute Caylee is.

636
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:26,240
She deserved better
than a mom with a tattoo.

637
00:30:26,274 --> 00:30:27,774
She deserved...

638
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,677
- <i>She deserved...</i>
- Me.

639
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,512
- Me.
- Me.

640
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:34,881
Tess, how's that
Google search coming?

641
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,251
It does look pretty bad.
A lot of fire.

642
00:30:37,285 --> 00:30:40,053
You'll notice little of her coverage
in this instance is about the law.

643
00:30:40,087 --> 00:30:41,854
You know, come to think of it,
I did notice that.

644
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:43,690
<i>It's all based on
an emotional appeal.</i>

645
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:46,359
<i>The way she would with a jury
if there was no judge there to stop her.</i>

646
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:48,261
Watch how she breaks down
courtroom footage.

647
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:50,964
<i>Liz, let's see
the video of Tot Mom</i>

648
00:30:50,998 --> 00:30:54,968
and Jose Baez back at it
in court again today.

649
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:59,540
Not a good look between
a death penalty defendant

650
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,942
and the lead defense attorney.

651
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,710
<i>Two seconds.</i>

652
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:06,780
Two seconds of Casey Anthony
walking past her lawyer--

653
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,715
<i>And she'll show it
to you in slow motion</i>

654
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,185
<i>and from a different angle</i>

655
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:14,054
<i>and at regular speed and from
the original angle again.</i>

656
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,123
- What does that remind you of?
- Instant replay in sports.

657
00:31:16,157 --> 00:31:17,958
And she looks pretty
pissed at her lawyer.

658
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:20,694
And that's exactly why she's showing it
to you so many times.

659
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,130
<i>So you have a chance to draw your own
thoroughly uninformed opinion</i>

660
00:31:23,165 --> 00:31:24,833
<i>about an utterly
innocuous exchange.</i>

661
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:26,334
She looks pissed.

662
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:29,104
I wonder if she's sleeping with her lawyer.
I bet she is.

663
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,239
I wonder if that's what she looked like
when she killed Caylee.

664
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:34,309
This is the best TV ever.
I've got to go on my Casey Anthony Facebook page

665
00:31:34,343 --> 00:31:36,912
and see if my Casey Anthony
Facebook friends just saw Casey Anthony

666
00:31:36,946 --> 00:31:38,914
make a Casey Anthony face
at her Casey Anthony lawyer.

667
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:41,683
All right, enough.
Will's a criminal prosecutor.

668
00:31:41,718 --> 00:31:44,819
Maybe he can talk about how our justice system
wasn't built to lock up guilty people.

669
00:31:44,853 --> 00:31:46,587
It was built to keep
innocent people free,

670
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:49,257
which is something Americans should
be proud of and fiercely protect.

671
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:51,092
No.

672
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:53,395
He can't ever imply that the viewer

673
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:55,163
doesn't already know everything
and that she might be innocent.

674
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:58,034
If we're gonna cover this,
we're gonna cover it our way.

675
00:31:58,068 --> 00:31:59,802
What's the point of covering it at all
unless we do it

676
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,537
in a way that gets
our audience back?

677
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:03,573
A modest proposal.
We could ourselves

678
00:32:03,608 --> 00:32:05,175
commit murder on our air.

679
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,678
In your face, Nancy Grace!

680
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:12,950
How do we get the best guests?

681
00:32:12,984 --> 00:32:15,485
There's a guy you're gonna have to
deal with named Dylan Kagin.

682
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,388
<i>He's like the Broadway Danny
Rose of tabloid suffering.</i>

683
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:19,756
He's an agent?

684
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,325
You ever ask yourself
why of all the missing kids

685
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:23,059
and murdered coeds,
most of them go unnoticed

686
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,095
- and some become national scandals?
- Sex appeal.

687
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:28,232
Right, but someone's got to find Lana Turner
sitting at the drugstore counter.

688
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:31,702
Dylan Kagin gropes through the trailer park
of American jurisprudence

689
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:33,537
for what he calls
"Oh, my God" stories.

690
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:36,339
Then he drops in on the victims,
the accused, the jurors, the cops,

691
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:38,541
whoever he can sell to the press,
the networks, and the studios.

692
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:39,976
He packages
the missing white girl.

693
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,944
All right, that'll be the A block.

694
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:43,246
By 2:00, show me where we are.

695
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,780
The B block's gonna
be Anthony Weiner,

696
00:32:44,815 --> 00:32:46,549
so, Jim, start putting
something together.

697
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,218
All we really have are the pictures
and Weiner not answering questions.

698
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:52,088
- I know that.
- You don't want to wait until we have--

699
00:32:52,122 --> 00:32:54,223
Facts?
No, that would be newsy and elitist.

700
00:32:54,257 --> 00:32:56,358
Let's just call them--
The A and the B block--

701
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:58,160
Let's just think
of them as a polished,

702
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,062
tightly produced abomination.

703
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:02,131
I've been sitting here
and I'm getting a little sick of this.

704
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,100
- You and me both.
- Jesus Christ.

705
00:33:04,134 --> 00:33:06,669
For a few weeks, we're not gonna
ask the country to eat its vegetables.

706
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:09,072
Why? Because there's
a debate we want to do

707
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:11,941
that trumps all of your Sarah Lawrence
ethical conundrums.

708
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,743
It shouldn't be
too hard to understand.

709
00:33:13,777 --> 00:33:15,945
So get it the fuck together.

710
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:20,283
He happens to be right.

711
00:33:20,317 --> 00:33:22,518
"War on drugs a failure."

712
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:25,054
I know how it feels.

713
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,660
Show me where
we are at 2:00.

714
00:33:32,664 --> 00:33:35,433
- <i>Can I see you a second?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

715
00:33:45,744 --> 00:33:48,179
- Do you mind if I sit in on--
- Yeah, sorry, no.

716
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:51,783
Not sure that's the best way
to get good press.

717
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:54,487
May 1st, the night we got bin Laden,
I got a call

718
00:33:54,521 --> 00:33:56,855
from an anonymous source at 7:30

719
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:59,225
telling me the White House
would send an email blast

720
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:01,560
to all the news agencies
in 90 minutes,

721
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:04,264
and obviously it turned out
he was right.

722
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:07,167
He was demonstrating his credibility.

723
00:34:07,201 --> 00:34:09,336
His name is Solomon Hancock.

724
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,704
He works in software engineering
at the NSA

725
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,906
and he handed me
a stack of documents,

726
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:17,042
transcripts of his testimony
describing illegal surveillance.

727
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,311
We have to start vetting him
and the documents.

728
00:34:19,345 --> 00:34:21,479
It's gonna take at least a few days,
but that's part one.

729
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:22,880
What's part two?

730
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:25,383
If we air his story,
he'll give us evidence

731
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,485
that <i>TMI</i>'s been doing the same thing
as <i>News of the World</i>.

732
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:32,389
- Hacking?
- Everything.

733
00:34:32,424 --> 00:34:34,993
- <i>TMI</i>'s been hacking?
- Hancock says he's got the proof.

734
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:37,395
Jesus Christ.
How high does he say it goes?

735
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:38,730
Reese.

736
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,568
- Let's get on with the vet.
- I'll have Jim run it.

737
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,503
- Is he up for this?
- He is, Will.

738
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:46,104
I taught him how to do the news.

739
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,540
I taught them all how to do the news.

740
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:50,876
Can you give us a second?

741
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:53,212
I'm done.

742
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,351
Why did it have to be Brian?

743
00:35:00,753 --> 00:35:03,221
Because I own him now.
He needs a cover story.

744
00:35:03,255 --> 00:35:05,056
If he writes a negative one,
he'll get slammed

745
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:07,191
with the whole soap opera
of our history.

746
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:08,593
Are you lying right now?

747
00:35:08,627 --> 00:35:11,029
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

748
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:14,900
Sloan says on Thursday,
the House is gonna vote to default on our loans,

749
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,569
leading to a global
economic meltdown.

750
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:21,840
Should I put that before or after
Anthony Weiner in his underwear?

751
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,078
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

752
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:36,154
<i>That's all for us tonight.</i>

753
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:38,189
Tomorrow we'll be bringing you
all the highlights

754
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:41,026
from day seven of the trial
and Detective Yuri Melich,

755
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,597
the first officer to interview
Casey Anthony in 2008.

756
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:46,499
<i>Terry Smith is coming up
from Washington</i>

757
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,601
<i>with the </i>Capital Report<i>.
I'm Will McAvoy.</i>

758
00:35:48,635 --> 00:35:51,437
Good night.

759
00:36:00,613 --> 00:36:03,748
<i>Will McAvoy, your new choice
for Casey Anthony coverage.</i>

760
00:36:03,783 --> 00:36:05,316
- They're coming home.
- Yeah?

761
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:06,784
We promo'd the hell of it.

762
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,653
We got 150,000 viewers back.

763
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:11,522
25-54, almost all women.

764
00:36:11,556 --> 00:36:14,091
That's toasters,
furniture, food, clothes,

765
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,926
kids' clothes, vacation plans.

766
00:36:16,961 --> 00:36:18,895
Our heads are above water now,
so do not stop.

767
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:20,597
- We won't.
- How about this heat?

768
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:22,665
- Yeah.
- 9:00 in the morning, it's already 87.

769
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,867
It's gonna hit 98.
That would beat the record for this day

770
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,236
- that was set in 1933.
- Yeah.

771
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,238
- You're looking at me funny.
- Yeah?

772
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:31,707
- I know you hate this.
- I'm looking at you the regular way.

773
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,908
- If you say so.
- I do.

774
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:36,078
There are also tornado warnings.

775
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:38,781
- Reese.
- What?

776
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:41,551
- Nothing.
- All right, so it's gonna get up to 98.

777
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:44,888
That's a record.
And there are tornado warnings for New York City.

778
00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:47,090
Well, you know, Aunt Bee,
tornados are just God's way

779
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,959
of destroying property
and killing people.

780
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:50,460
People like hearing
about extreme weather.

781
00:36:50,494 --> 00:36:52,295
We're not doing a fucking
weather report, okay?

782
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,198
We're not coming up with
some "Tornado Watch" graphic.

783
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:56,333
We're a serious news organization.

784
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,369
Tonight we'll be reporting on the
killer cocktail waitress and the congressman--

785
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:01,805
- Is Mac bitching at you?
- Not nearly as much as she should be.

786
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,841
I came in here to tell you
you got back 150,000 viewers

787
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,409
you lost while you were
trying to be above it.

788
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:08,578
We'll be sure not to try that again.

789
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:10,046
98 degrees is when
we have power outages.

790
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,915
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

791
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,950
I don't want to go all
conspiracy theory on you,

792
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,419
but I think the heat might
be related to power outages.

793
00:37:16,453 --> 00:37:19,255
- Take it easy.
- Say hi to your mom.

794
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:21,357
Will do.

795
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,995
Visiting hours will be
Tuesday and Friday.

796
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:28,097
Don't be nervous.

797
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,169
We got 150,000 viewers back last night.
Mostly women.

798
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:35,703
- I know.
- I was telling her.

799
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:38,707
You know, it's gonna get
up to 98 degrees.

800
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:40,208
Next person who tells me
about the damn weather...

801
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:41,543
Do you know what
you're doing here?

802
00:37:41,577 --> 00:37:43,478
I've been asked to
tell you about the weather.

803
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,881
Does it feel to you like anyone in this room
is in the mood for a joke?

804
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:49,049
It absolutely does not.

805
00:37:49,084 --> 00:37:51,018
We want you to lead
the vetting of this source.

806
00:37:51,053 --> 00:37:54,488
He's telling us about
illegal surveillance at the NSA.

807
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,659
He's also telling us that <i>TMI</i> is in
the same game as <i>News of the World</i>.

808
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,595
Jesus.

809
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:03,130
<i>We're looking at a couple
of scenarios, Jim.</i>

810
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:05,299
One is that we're sitting on a scoop
that could shake up the NSA

811
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:07,134
and maybe have the country
take another look at the Patriot Act.

812
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:09,337
But the <i>TMI</i> element,
doesn't that--

813
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,906
And another is that someone's
trying to discredit us

814
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:14,643
by having Will
get Dan Rather-ed.

815
00:38:14,677 --> 00:38:18,347
You'll need to file a couple of hundred
Freedom of Information Act requests

816
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:20,916
and you'll need to get into
this guy's personal life

817
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:23,386
<i>and you'll need to do it all</i>

818
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,656
without raising
any flags at the NSA.

819
00:38:26,691 --> 00:38:28,191
Are you up for this?

820
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:35,165
- Yeah.
- We don't need it fast, we need it right.

821
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,334
- But we need it fast.
- I'll start mapping it out.

822
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:40,202
Jim, since the day
you started working here,

823
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,939
I never felt the need to remind you
about confidentiality

824
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,874
and I don't feel that need now.

825
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:50,680
Okay.

826
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,325
- Gotcha.
- Oh, God.

827
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,660
- You feel like being interviewed?
- You read my mind.

828
00:39:03,695 --> 00:39:05,496
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do right now

829
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,398
than be interviewed
by my ex-boyfriend,

830
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:08,665
except maybe eat my desk.

831
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,101
- It seems like a bad week to be here.
- It is.

832
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:14,104
I came here to write a story about how Will
and <i>News Night</i> changed overnight.

833
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,172
- And then you changed overnight.
<i>- Look.</i>

834
00:39:16,206 --> 00:39:18,741
- It's the old Will all over--
- These are extraordinary circumstances.

835
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,509
That's what everyone says
when they abandon their principles.

836
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:23,111
I'm no longer required
to live up to your standards.

837
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:25,848
- Fair enough.
- Thank you.

838
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:31,519
What's so special
about this debate?

839
00:39:31,554 --> 00:39:33,722
If we get what we want,
no one will ever go back.

840
00:39:33,756 --> 00:39:35,323
We'll have changed
the debates forever.

841
00:39:35,357 --> 00:39:38,159
And your concern is that if your ratings are low,
you'll lose leverage?

842
00:39:38,194 --> 00:39:40,462
- Yes.
- Is that your concern or Will's concern?

843
00:39:40,496 --> 00:39:42,397
Will's concerns
are my concerns.

844
00:39:42,431 --> 00:39:45,567
'Cause another way of looking at it is
that he lost his invisible friends

845
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:48,870
to Nancy Grace and he's using the debate
as an excuse to dumb the show down.

846
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:51,974
That's a pretty bold statement from
a guy who's auditioning for a job.

847
00:39:52,008 --> 00:39:54,409
He's gonna give me the job.
And it's not like I don't know why.

848
00:39:54,443 --> 00:39:57,479
- Do you?
- I do because I'm not a fucking moron.

849
00:39:57,514 --> 00:39:59,915
The email that was read
by everyone in the world,

850
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:03,152
"I cheated on Will,"
you were talking about me, right?

851
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:09,259
- Yes.
- You were seeing Will while we were together?

852
00:40:09,293 --> 00:40:11,261
If you count drunk dialing me
at midnight and saying,

853
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:14,599
"Just come on over and crawl into bed"
as being together, then yes.

854
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:15,967
- I count it.
- Then yes.

855
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,635
You cheated on me with Will?

856
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:20,472
Let's be as clear as anyone
has ever been about anything.

857
00:40:20,506 --> 00:40:22,407
I cheated on Will with you.

858
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:23,842
And I'm paying the price.

859
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:25,945
I work 30 feet from
the life I could have had

860
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:27,446
if I hadn't been so stupid.

861
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,548
And you're looking at
the life you could have had

862
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,684
if you hadn't been a douchebag.

863
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:37,757
How's the interview
going so far?

864
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:40,493
Is douchebag one word or two?

865
00:40:40,527 --> 00:40:42,828
Come in.

866
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:46,232
- Sorry, I can come back.
- No, what do you need?

867
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:52,271
Ahem, well,
there's a story I'd like to pitch.

868
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:55,475
Brian, this is Neal Sampat.
Neal writes Will's blog.

869
00:40:55,509 --> 00:40:58,211
- Will doesn't write Will's blog?
- Will can't find Will's blog.

870
00:40:58,245 --> 00:41:00,513
Neal wants to be a producer,
so from time to time,

871
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:03,249
he pitches stories.
What do you got?

872
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:04,885
You know what a troll is,
right?

873
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:07,120
A tiny creature that stands
under a footbridge

874
00:41:07,155 --> 00:41:09,723
and makes you answer a riddle
before you're allowed to pass.

875
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,792
- They're not real, man.
- I know that.

876
00:41:11,827 --> 00:41:13,160
He means
the other kind of troll.

877
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:15,496
You don't know the first clue
what he means.

878
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:17,165
I mean the other kind of troll.

879
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,100
A little backup
would have killed you?

880
00:41:19,168 --> 00:41:21,303
<i>Sorry, Internet trolls.
It's a play on a fishing term.</i>

881
00:41:21,337 --> 00:41:22,604
People who go to message boards

882
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,406
and try to hijack the conversation
by being incendiary.

883
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,742
- What about them?
- Turns out they have their own websites.

884
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,244
Like an online clubhouse.
And to be accepted into the group,

885
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,480
you have to be able to point to
a successful incident of trolling,

886
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:34,684
a recent time when you made
a whole bunch of posters lose their minds.

887
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,319
Or better yet, got the site monitor
to shut down the board.

888
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:40,222
Actually, I like it.
And it's not about Bigfoot.

889
00:41:40,256 --> 00:41:42,691
Write this down, <i>News Night</i> is gonna
break the story on Bigfoot.

890
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:45,861
We're not. Don't write that down.
Will they talk to you?

891
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:48,897
They won't talk to a reporter,
but I thought maybe I'd try to get in there.

892
00:41:48,931 --> 00:41:52,701
Undercover?
Aren't you gonna have to say you trolled something?

893
00:41:52,735 --> 00:41:55,069
I'm not gonna have to say it,
I'm gonna actually have to do it.

894
00:41:55,104 --> 00:41:56,738
<i>To who?</i>

895
00:41:56,772 --> 00:42:00,041
Well, I don't want to ding on
an innocent person for a story,

896
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:01,643
so I'm gonna have to do it
to one of us.

897
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:02,777
You can't be anonymous
on our website.

898
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:03,912
No, I mean do it to us
on another website.

899
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:06,448
- What would it be?
- I don't know yet.

900
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:09,485
Come back when you know,
but you've made it past the first hurdle.

901
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:11,821
Thank you.

902
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:16,658
- Sloan.
- How's her mood in there?

903
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:18,761
It's not good,
but let me ask you something.

904
00:42:18,795 --> 00:42:21,297
For the sake of a story,

905
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:25,401
how would you feel about me going
on the Internet and saying vicious things

906
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:27,636
about you that might get
an argument started about misogyny?

907
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,271
- What kind of vicious things?
- I don't know.

908
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:32,474
- What would the general area be?
- I really don't know.

909
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,544
- Something about the way you look?
- Like what?

910
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:37,946
- I'd be making it up.
- What would you be making up?

911
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,316
It wouldn't be true.
It'd be something like--

912
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,219
Something along the lines of
she screwed her way to the top

913
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:47,055
and she's got a big ass.
Only it would have to be--

914
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:49,724
Listen to me, Sampat.

915
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:52,460
- Do I?
- Of course not.

916
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,465
Okay.

917
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,234
- I can do it?
- You cannot.

918
00:42:59,268 --> 00:43:01,369
If you want, you can say that
I made it to the final round

919
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,405
of the K through six regionals in
the Scripps Howard Spelling Bee.

920
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:06,341
That's not gonna help me.

921
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,644
You know,
a lot of guys like women with big--

922
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:12,314
Do they really?

923
00:43:12,348 --> 00:43:13,916
Never mind.

924
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:16,251
I don't know what you're talking about
and I have my own problems.

925
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,293
- Jim.
- Yeah?

926
00:43:24,328 --> 00:43:26,162
I got a woman on the phone
who says she's got some tweets

927
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:27,664
from Anthony Weiner
and wants to talk to us.

928
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:30,467
- What are you telling me for?
- Seniority?

929
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:33,770
Well, I'm handing her off to
the next most senior person.

930
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:35,171
Kendra, take the Weiner girl.

931
00:43:35,206 --> 00:43:37,273
- Gary, take the Weiner girl.
- Tess.

932
00:43:37,308 --> 00:43:40,710
- Tamara.
- We were hired as interns the same day.

933
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:43,580
I was hired in the morning.
You were hired after lunch. Take the Weiner girl.

934
00:43:43,614 --> 00:43:47,184
- <i>Please, don't make me take the Weiner girl.</i>
- Respect the seniority.

935
00:43:47,218 --> 00:43:49,252
Who do I have seniority over?

936
00:43:50,955 --> 00:43:52,422
Maggie.

937
00:43:54,492 --> 00:43:56,960
- Can people still see me?
- On five.

938
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,301
Hi, this is Margaret Jordan.

939
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:06,470
<i>I'm an associate producer
at </i>News Night<i>.</i>

940
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:09,272
Okay, can you spell that for me?

941
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:11,908
Okay, wait.

942
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,209
Hang on.

943
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,879
I-- No, you're gonna
get a chance.

944
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:21,784
Uh, well, you certainly seem to
want to share your story.

945
00:44:23,187 --> 00:44:25,154
You really can't just
drop in on a doctor.

946
00:44:25,189 --> 00:44:27,624
- What if it's an emergency?
<i>- You go to the emergency room.</i>

947
00:44:27,658 --> 00:44:29,459
They don't have
psychiatric emergency rooms.

948
00:44:29,494 --> 00:44:31,829
They should.
You're a good reason why.

949
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:34,764
- You want a piece of me?
- Seriously?

950
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,933
- No.
- Yeah.

951
00:44:41,172 --> 00:44:42,705
Does he look over
at the red light?

952
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,007
Does he look every few minutes?

953
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,175
If I was your therapist,

954
00:44:45,209 --> 00:44:47,143
I'd definitely look every few minutes.

955
00:44:48,479 --> 00:44:49,645
Hey, hey, you can't do that.

956
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,981
It's okay.
He likes me.

957
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:54,350
- Will.
- I'm sorry.

958
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:56,118
- I'm with a patient.
- I really just need a second.

959
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,021
I'm glad to see you back here,
but you need to come during your appointment.

960
00:44:59,055 --> 00:45:01,624
I could be dead by then.

961
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:03,259
Are you having suicidal thoughts?

962
00:45:03,293 --> 00:45:04,927
- No.
- Then why did you say that?

963
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:07,196
- Just to get your attention.
- I'm going back to my patient.

964
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,831
Listen to me.
I've been paying 250 a session for four years

965
00:45:09,866 --> 00:45:11,133
without showing up
to a single session.

966
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:13,601
You owe me $100,000
worth of therapy.

967
00:45:13,636 --> 00:45:16,371
I'll forgive the debt, we'll be totally square,
just give me one minute.

968
00:45:19,808 --> 00:45:22,343
I'm sorry.
I'll be just a minute.

969
00:45:23,879 --> 00:45:25,746
Wow, you caved for the money.
I'm kind of disappointed.

970
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,816
I didn't cave for the money.
You're getting the sessions you paid for.

971
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,785
You seem like you're in pain.

972
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,855
- He is.
- He said in pain, not a pain.

973
00:45:33,889 --> 00:45:35,490
Oh, never mind, then.

974
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,225
What is it?

975
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,296
I'm doing all these things
that are wrong because of ratings,

976
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:43,199
and I'm making the staff do things
that they don't want to do,

977
00:45:43,234 --> 00:45:46,770
I'm cursing them out,
I'm ignoring incredibly important news stories,

978
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:48,772
and I'm betraying the trust
of people who respect me.

979
00:45:48,807 --> 00:45:50,841
And I did it all
in the blink of an eye.

980
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:53,277
- That can be traumatic.
- No, I'm fine with all of that.

981
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:55,680
Here's my thing:
<i>New York Magazine</i>

982
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:58,015
is gonna do a story on my show
and I get to choose the writer.

983
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,652
And I could have chosen anybody and
I chose Mackenzie's ex-boyfriend.

984
00:46:01,686 --> 00:46:03,420
Of course.

985
00:46:03,455 --> 00:46:06,356
- The one she cheated on you with?
- Yeah.

986
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,159
- Why?
- That's what I came here to ask you.

987
00:46:09,194 --> 00:46:10,861
You're holding your hand
over the candle.

988
00:46:10,895 --> 00:46:12,128
What do you mean?

989
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:13,897
You're holding your hand
over the candle

990
00:46:13,931 --> 00:46:16,032
because you think
the trick is not minding.

991
00:46:16,066 --> 00:46:18,734
Ah.

992
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:22,204
So if I just get through this,
I'll be fine.

993
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,374
- No.
- Why?

994
00:46:24,408 --> 00:46:26,509
Because the trick isn't not minding.

995
00:46:26,544 --> 00:46:29,278
The trick is forgiving Mackenzie.

996
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:31,514
It would be easier to
hold my hand over the candle.

997
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:33,449
I know.

998
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:37,153
Well, you've been no help at all, but thanks.
Sorry to barge in.

999
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:39,489
You know, while you're
working your way through this,

1000
00:46:39,523 --> 00:46:41,091
you're hurting Mackenzie.

1001
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,560
I know that.

1002
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:47,396
Show up for your appointment.

1003
00:46:51,569 --> 00:46:53,537
I'm not doing it on purpose.

1004
00:46:57,508 --> 00:46:59,275
Maggie.

1005
00:47:00,311 --> 00:47:02,646
Yeah.

1006
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:07,451
- Sandy?
- Yes.

1007
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:09,719
- Margaret Jordan. We talked on the phone.
- Nice to meet you.

1008
00:47:09,754 --> 00:47:11,388
- You got here okay?
- Yes.

1009
00:47:11,422 --> 00:47:13,456
I have a receipt for the cab.
Who do I give that to?

1010
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:15,325
I'll take it.

1011
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:19,829
So, you got some tweets
from Congressman Weiner.

1012
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:22,232
And I've got copies
of them right here.

1013
00:47:25,704 --> 00:47:27,872
"'I like the cute new pics of you.

1014
00:47:27,906 --> 00:47:29,740
Where'd you get those abs?"

1015
00:47:29,775 --> 00:47:32,810
Weiner: "Glad you like them.
When do I get to see your swimsuit shot?"

1016
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:35,580
Sandy: "When are you
coming to see me?

1017
00:47:35,614 --> 00:47:38,015
Or just coming?"
Weiner: "Make me an offer."

1018
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:40,384
Sandy: "My door's always open.
Get it?"

1019
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,620
Weiner: "What's your plan for us?"

1020
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:46,290
Sandy: "To get us in the mood,
we watch <i>The Daily Show</i> and <i>Colbert</i>.

1021
00:47:46,324 --> 00:47:48,192
<i>Then when we're really hot,
we go to the bookstore</i>

1022
00:47:48,226 --> 00:47:50,060
<i>and replace all the copies
of Glenn Beck books</i>

1023
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:52,763
with <i>The Audacity of Hope</i>.
Or, if that's not your thing,

1024
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,099
we can just get drunk and fuck."

1025
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,040
Why are you doing this?

1026
00:48:03,074 --> 00:48:04,975
Because the world needs to know
what kind of guy he is.

1027
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:08,779
It sort of seems like you were
a willing participant.

1028
00:48:08,847 --> 00:48:10,314
I didn't know about
the other women.

1029
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:12,116
- Did you know he was married?
- Of course.

1030
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,685
I just didn't know
about the other women.

1031
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:18,756
I was fooled and I think the world
needs to know what kind of guy he is.

1032
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,225
By any chance, have you heard
of a guy named Dylan Kagin?

1033
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,527
He's gonna be my agent.

1034
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:27,363
Sandy--
Can I call you Sandy?

1035
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:28,964
Sure.

1036
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:32,468
Sandy, the congressman
is in a lot of trouble.

1037
00:48:32,502 --> 00:48:34,470
He got himself into it

1038
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:37,273
and he's probably not gonna
be able to get out of it.

1039
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:41,845
Are you sure
you want to pile on?

1040
00:48:41,879 --> 00:48:44,981
I think people need to know
what kind of person he is.

1041
00:48:45,015 --> 00:48:46,950
All right.

1042
00:48:49,087 --> 00:48:51,021
Would you like to be
on our show tonight?

1043
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:54,425
That's the thing.
I'm doing <i>Access Hollywood</i>, <i>ET</i>, and Fox.

1044
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:56,727
The big three.
No problem.

1045
00:48:56,761 --> 00:48:59,897
We can do a pretape
in a few minutes.

1046
00:48:59,932 --> 00:49:01,865
Oh, you're a lifesaver.
I was hoping you'd say that.

1047
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,834
No kidding?
Stay here

1048
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:07,537
and I'll talk to my EP
and we'll get this going.

1049
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:08,872
Could I possibly get
a decaf latte?

1050
00:49:08,907 --> 00:49:10,707
You cannot possibly get that,

1051
00:49:10,742 --> 00:49:13,277
but I'll have someone
bring you a coffee.

1052
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:22,153
Well, I left it for you
on the left side of the desk.

1053
00:49:22,187 --> 00:49:24,823
And, yes, I signed it.

1054
00:49:24,857 --> 00:49:26,324
I don't know anything about it.

1055
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:28,827
Leona!

1056
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:30,228
A word?

1057
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:32,430
Okay, ask her to show it to me
on the plane.

1058
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,567
Let's not stand in the street.

1059
00:49:36,602 --> 00:49:38,636
Charlie, with that bow tie,

1060
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:40,271
you look like
a balloon salesman.

1061
00:49:40,306 --> 00:49:42,140
No, I get in the car
and get out a minute later,

1062
00:49:42,174 --> 00:49:46,310
it looks like we're talking about
a problem or making a drug deal.

1063
00:49:46,345 --> 00:49:47,712
Just a minute.

1064
00:49:47,746 --> 00:49:50,782
We're gonna stand here,
smile and nod,

1065
00:49:50,816 --> 00:49:53,951
and do this and laugh.

1066
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:58,522
We know where the tabloid stories
are coming from.

1067
00:49:58,556 --> 00:50:00,891
They're coming from reality.

1068
00:50:00,925 --> 00:50:03,593
Only if you define reality as fantasy.

1069
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,995
And they're appearing in
a magazine you own.

1070
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,397
How would it look if I had
one of our news magazines

1071
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:10,232
go soft on our flagship anchor?

1072
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,235
We're calling <i>TMI</i>
a news magazine?

1073
00:50:12,269 --> 00:50:15,338
People need to know
if Taylor Swift is happy.

1074
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:18,942
- I provide a public service for hundreds of thousands--
- The public's grateful.

1075
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:21,812
What did I tell you
the day after election night?

1076
00:50:21,846 --> 00:50:26,116
Friend to friend,
I'd stop coming after Will in the tabloids.

1077
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,786
I told you to get him to lighten up
on the Tea Party

1078
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:32,155
or a context would be created

1079
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,425
whereby his firing
would look reasonable.

1080
00:50:34,459 --> 00:50:37,194
- You need to hear me.
- I don't think I do.

1081
00:50:37,228 --> 00:50:39,696
The 112th Congress
wasn't even seated

1082
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:42,966
and he took the Tea Party out for a walk
on the 9/11 Responders Bill.

1083
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,769
Congress,
Democrats and Republicans,

1084
00:50:45,804 --> 00:50:49,673
spent eight years
using 9/11 as a justification

1085
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:52,175
for everything from tax cuts
to a foreign invasion.

1086
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:55,412
So Will questioned
their change of heart

1087
00:50:55,447 --> 00:50:58,015
when it came to
the police and firemen's unions.

1088
00:50:58,049 --> 00:51:00,217
You made them
look like hypocrites.

1089
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:01,952
By rolling tape.

1090
00:51:01,986 --> 00:51:04,454
House Financial Services,
insider trading,

1091
00:51:04,489 --> 00:51:07,424
Keystone XL, Joe Walsh,
Allen West,

1092
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:09,994
Paul Ryan,
and who am I forgetting?

1093
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:13,864
Oh, yes.
Charles and David Koch.

1094
00:51:13,899 --> 00:51:15,266
Keep smiling.

1095
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,202
We lost a couple of
awfully helpful tax loopholes

1096
00:51:18,236 --> 00:51:20,604
that were tailored
to assets overseas.

1097
00:51:20,638 --> 00:51:23,607
And the FCC won't even let us bid
on the coming spectrum auction

1098
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:25,875
because they want
a full report on whether or not

1099
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,078
we're skirting antitrust.

1100
00:51:29,113 --> 00:51:31,581
So what was your request again?

1101
00:51:31,615 --> 00:51:34,217
You don't want to do this.

1102
00:51:34,251 --> 00:51:36,185
I don't.

1103
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,254
I really don't.

1104
00:51:38,288 --> 00:51:40,323
But I have to and I will.

1105
00:51:40,357 --> 00:51:43,693
And friend to friend,

1106
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:46,796
you let him know that
he is one tabloid fuckup

1107
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:50,099
and a ratings point away
from having his own podcast.

1108
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:53,703
I have to make my plane.

1109
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:01,411
Fly safe.

1110
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,461
- Unless there's a rally--
- I'm sorry, I've got to--

1111
00:52:18,496 --> 00:52:20,130
- <i>Listen.</i>
- Sloan.

1112
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,732
Unless there's a rally
in the next 90 minutes,

1113
00:52:21,766 --> 00:52:24,134
the Dow's gonna close
down about 2.5%,

1114
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:26,437
S&P and NASDAQ will
close down 2.3.

1115
00:52:26,471 --> 00:52:28,539
- Let me tell you why.
- I don't own a lot of stock.

1116
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:29,774
- Let me tell you why.
- I really can't--

1117
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,175
Stop avoiding this!

1118
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,177
I just got off the phone
with these guys.

1119
00:52:33,212 --> 00:52:35,513
Listen to these quotes.
These aren't from liberals.

1120
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:38,583
These are hard-core Wall Street guys who,
whatever the world may think of them,

1121
00:52:38,617 --> 00:52:40,451
know what they're talking about
and so do I.

1122
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:42,988
Jamie Dimon at Chase says,

1123
00:52:43,022 --> 00:52:46,023
"Voting against raising the debt ceiling
would be a moral disaster."

1124
00:52:46,058 --> 00:52:49,761
The Barclays guys say,
"This debate is detached from reality."

1125
00:52:49,795 --> 00:52:53,732
My Goldman source says,
"If the House Republicans continue this debate,

1126
00:52:53,766 --> 00:52:55,600
I hope they're willing
to mark the end

1127
00:52:55,634 --> 00:52:58,770
of the dollar as a global
reserve currency."

1128
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:03,175
Please notice that he didn't say if the House
Republicans don't raise the debt ceiling.

1129
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:07,179
He said if the House Republicans
continue this debate.

1130
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:11,683
That's all it takes.
Just the uncertainty.

1131
00:53:11,718 --> 00:53:15,721
That's why the Dow's gonna close
down 230 points today.

1132
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:18,724
Because just the debate,
just the doubt,

1133
00:53:18,758 --> 00:53:21,426
just the possibility that
the House Majority might commit

1134
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:23,795
the most self-inflicted damage
to the country

1135
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,198
since the secession
of the South

1136
00:53:26,232 --> 00:53:28,133
has caused billions
in value to disappear.

1137
00:53:28,168 --> 00:53:30,703
Sloan, I understand.
I swear to God I do.

1138
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:32,471
But you can't say
the same thing in the C block?

1139
00:53:32,506 --> 00:53:34,540
Don't pretend you don't know that most people
watch 10 minutes of news.

1140
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:36,342
- The first 10 minutes.
- The vote isn't until tomorrow night.

1141
00:53:36,376 --> 00:53:38,577
And it's only the first vote.
You said yourself it was cosmetic.

1142
00:53:38,612 --> 00:53:39,779
Why do we have
to feature it tonight?

1143
00:53:39,813 --> 00:53:41,047
We should have been
featuring it weeks ago.

1144
00:53:41,081 --> 00:53:43,349
Why do we have to
feature it tonight?

1145
00:53:43,383 --> 00:53:45,518
<i>To give time for the people
to call their congressmen</i>

1146
00:53:45,552 --> 00:53:47,586
and say,
"If you fuck with the full faith

1147
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,688
and credit of the US Treasury,
you're fired."

1148
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:53,092
To give time for the people to jam
the phone lines of the district offices.

1149
00:53:53,126 --> 00:53:55,528
To give the people time to say,

1150
00:53:55,562 --> 00:53:57,630
"I'm a fiscal conservative

1151
00:53:57,665 --> 00:54:01,135
and you've got to put the pin
back in the grenade right now."

1152
00:54:01,169 --> 00:54:03,704
<i>That's why.</i>

1153
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:08,676
I'm gonna do everything I can.

1154
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,011
Please do.

1155
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:18,351
Don't worry about it.

1156
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,587
She's just frustrated because
she can't get the word out

1157
00:54:20,621 --> 00:54:23,256
that this is a global emergency
unless you let her.

1158
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,994
Appreciate your
clearing that up.

1159
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:30,930
You know what, Mackenzie?

1160
00:54:30,964 --> 00:54:33,766
I'm not the one
who put me here.

1161
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,835
Say what you want about me,
but I wouldn't have done that.

1162
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,450
Does Will have the questions?

1163
00:54:51,485 --> 00:54:53,586
Tess is giving him
some cards now.

1164
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:59,424
- Is that lighting okay for you?
- Yeah.

1165
00:54:59,459 --> 00:55:01,593
- How are we Chyroning her?
- I was gonna ask you.

1166
00:55:01,628 --> 00:55:04,897
Figure it out later.

1167
00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:11,103
- Sandy.
- Yes?

1168
00:55:11,137 --> 00:55:14,073
My name's Mackenzie.
I'm the executive--

1169
00:55:15,943 --> 00:55:18,044
I'm the executive producer
of <i>News Night</i>.

1170
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,913
- <i>Can you hear me okay?</i>
- Yes.

1171
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:22,849
Okay.
Thanks for being patient with us.

1172
00:55:22,884 --> 00:55:25,753
Will's just throwing on
a jacket and tie

1173
00:55:25,787 --> 00:55:27,688
and we'll be able to do this.

1174
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:30,791
- Real easy.
- You got it.

1175
00:55:41,236 --> 00:55:43,571
Hi, I'm a big fan.

1176
00:55:43,605 --> 00:55:46,040
- Hmm?
- I'm Sandy.

1177
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,042
How do you do?

1178
00:55:48,077 --> 00:55:50,845
- Are we ready for the pre-tape?
- Yeah.

1179
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,581
- <i>Just count me down.</i>
- Will.

1180
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,916
Yes, I'm sure
I want to do this.

1181
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:58,720
God, please give me a sign
I'm not doing a big thing badly.

1182
