1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,719
Will:
<i>Where's my staff?</i>

2
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:04,451
We're gonna try
Elliot out at 10:00.

3
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:07,150
<i>He's taking your EP and your
EP's taking your staff.</i>

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,007
- Wait, you asked to leave?
- I did.

5
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,975
- I hired you a new EP.
- <i>You're not talking about Mackenzie.</i>

6
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,813
- I had to right the ship.
- I tried to get in touch with you

7
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:16,744
a lot of times
in the last three years.

8
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:18,638
- Did you get all those emails?
- I didn't read them.

9
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:21,573
- James Harper, this is Maggie--
- Margaret Jordan-- Maggie's fine.

10
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,741
I need Don Keefer to help me
through this transition.

11
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,745
<i>It turns out</i>
<i>Don's dating Maggie.</i>

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,381
He's going to be
threatened by you,

13
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,482
so he'll try to impress Maggie,
who's staying with Will.

14
00:00:29,516 --> 00:00:31,250
- You understand?
- <i>( news alert beeps )</i>

15
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:33,084
There's been an explosion
off the coast of Louisiana.

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,022
You've got to ask her
why there's no contingency.

17
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:36,990
Why are we drilling
three miles underwater

18
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:38,592
when we don't have
the technology

19
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:40,160
to fix the world's
most predictable emergency?

20
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:41,762
Good to see you again, Will.

21
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,464
You didn't bring her in
to right the ship.

22
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:46,267
You brought her in
to build a new one.

Yes.

Gary Cooper.

29
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:56,939
Can that really be his name?

30
00:02:56,973 --> 00:03:00,343
- Yes. Desk producer.

New neighbors.

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,694
Okay.

36
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:32,943
- Morning.
- Big day.

37
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:34,244
Can I talk to you a second?

38
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:37,246
- We've got a rundown meeting.
- Yeah.

39
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,181
- They're very young out there.
- I know.

40
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,582
But what they lack
in experience,

41
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:42,751
they make up for
in inexperience.

42
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,452
- Mac--
- It's an asset.

43
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,620
- They don't know how to do the news badly yet.
- Or really at all.

44
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,155
Some of them
will be doing things

45
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,756
they haven't done before,
but they'll be supervised.

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,191
I want to grow these people,

47
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,659
so you're going
to go easy on them.

48
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:53,793
We talked about this last night

49
00:03:53,828 --> 00:03:55,261
and for three hours
the night before

50
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,197
and again at 4:00 AM
this morning.

51
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,798
And you're sure you don't
wanna lead with the spill?

52
00:03:58,832 --> 00:04:01,534
- I am. Is that what you wanted to talk about?
- No.

53
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:04,636
I think most people here know that
you and I were together a while ago.

54
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,405
I think so, too.

55
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,540
- I don't want anyone to know why
we're not together now. - Sure.

56
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,542
- I mean no one.
- You think I'm gonna talk about it?

57
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:12,611
I find it hard to predict
what you will and won't do.

58
00:04:12,645 --> 00:04:14,279
- I won't be telling anyone.
- As long as we're straight.

59
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:16,182
- We are.
- No one. Nothing.

60
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:17,717
Just to be clear, you want me

61
00:04:17,752 --> 00:04:20,854
- to tell some people, but not everyone.
- Let's go.

62
00:04:20,888 --> 00:04:23,423
You're going to have nine minutes with
Jan Brewer, nine minutes with La Raza.

63
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,692
I wanna go on record saying
we should open with the spill.

64
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,328
- Done.
- We'll open with the spill?

65
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:29,096
No, but you're on record
saying you think we should.

66
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:30,698
The spill is all
anyone's talking about.

67
00:04:30,732 --> 00:04:32,433
Because we're the ones
telling them to.

68
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,602
We're still reporting on it,
just not at the top.

69
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,372
I'm looking at film of an oil
rig sinking into the ocean.

70
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,806
That's pretty good television.

71
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:42,043
We don't do good television,
we do the news.

72
00:04:43,612 --> 00:04:45,113
- Good morning.
- All: Good morning.

73
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:49,317
And welcome to the first pitch
meeting of "News Night" 2.0.

74
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:51,286
The chaos of the spill
is settling down

75
00:04:51,354 --> 00:04:53,555
and we get to do
our first real show.

76
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,090
<i>11:00, I hear</i>
<i>the pitches;</i>

77
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:57,325
4:00, the show starts
to look like the show;

78
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,694
and 6:00, we lock it in.

79
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:00,095
I learned everyone's
names last night.

80
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,164
Mackenzie: <i>A huge step
in the right direction.</i>

81
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,433
We'll be opening tonight
with SB 1070,

82
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:06,168
the Arizona immigration bill,

83
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,970
which Will supports,
by the way.

84
00:05:08,005 --> 00:05:09,472
You all thought
he was a closet liberal

85
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:10,673
when, really,
he's a closet moron.

86
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:11,774
I'm not a closet anything.

87
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:13,509
Seriously, I know
everyone's name.

88
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:16,614
I was up half the night learning
to pronounce Calanasia Zbrezniak.

89
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,015
Cally doesn't
work here anymore.

90
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,285
- Dianastasia Jorma?
- Nope.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,454
Mohammed al Mohammed
el Mohammed bin Bazir?

92
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,691
- Went to Fox. - Fox hired someone 
with three Mohammeds in their name?

93
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,660
But let's give him
a hand for effort.

94
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,262
Will:
Shut up!

95
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:32,631
- Is your name really Gary Cooper?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,434
What is "News Night" 2.0?

97
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,202
- This is--
- Mac, the--

98
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,837
Right.
Thank you.

99
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,939
Before we get to 2.0,
I'm supposed to read

100
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,575
something from IT
and I don't want to forget.

101
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,611
"New aliases have been set up
for in-house e-mails.

102
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,015
Autocomplete has been
enabled on your Outlook."

103
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,885
Anybody know what that meant?

104
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,353
Right.

105
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,056
"Asterisk-interns"
or "asterisk-staff"--

106
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,692
an asterisk makes it
go to a group.

107
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,361
No asterisk makes it
go to an individual.

108
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,196
Your name is Neelamani Sampat.

109
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,831
- Nailed it.
- Neal's fine.

110
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,099
Can you say it one more time?

111
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,634
Just type an e-mail
to someone.

112
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,772
Okay, I'm sending
an e-mail to Will.

113
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:15,809
I'm typing it.
I'm still typing it.

114
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,478
- What are you doing now?
- Still typing.

115
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:21,048
And I'm sending it.

116
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:26,720
( cell phones ringing )

117
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,888
It's all right.
You made two mistakes.

118
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,025
You used an asterisk, and
instead of typing W for "Will,"

119
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,595
- you typed S for "staff."
- They're close together on the keyboard.

120
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,663
"Will McAvoy's a closet bigot
who hates immigrants

121
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,298
even though this country
was founded by immigrants."

122
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,167
- Everybody get the same thing?
- All: Yep.

123
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:41,636
No one in this newsroom's job

124
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,538
is being threatened
by an undocumented worker.

125
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:46,441
Here we go.
This is "News Night" 2.0.

126
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,410
- ( all gasp )
- Mackenzie: Sorry!

127
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:51,847
- ( sighs )
- <i>( knocking at door )</i>

128
00:06:51,914 --> 00:06:53,815
- Excuse me, Charlie?
- Yeah.

129
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,284
You wanted to see me?

130
00:06:55,318 --> 00:06:57,752
A 12-year-old kid in Topeka
is trying to convince me

131
00:06:57,787 --> 00:06:59,354
he's got a pair of jacks
in the hole.

132
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:01,523
- Shouldn't he be in school?
- He is in school.

133
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:04,326
- How can I help you?
- Hang on.

134
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:06,995
He really did have
jacks in the hole.

135
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,331
Is there a way I can
tell his parents?

136
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,834
- I'm a little busy.
- Sure.

137
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,869
You know how you have
a secret meeting with Will

138
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:15,437
every day to talk
about numbers?

139
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:18,640
- I-- we don't have a secret meeting.
- Yeah, you do.

140
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:22,277
- You meet with him in private and you tell him exactly--
- I do it at his request.

141
00:07:22,312 --> 00:07:23,746
- It's very instructive.
- It is.

142
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,080
- It's invaluable.
- Yeah.

143
00:07:25,114 --> 00:07:26,448
I want you to stop.

144
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:28,551
Don't break down the numbers
for him for a little while.

145
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:29,919
Can I ask why?

146
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:31,721
We're trying something new

147
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:33,723
and I don't want him
getting cold feet.

148
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,058
- He listens to you.
- He should.

149
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:36,527
But what do you mean
you're trying something new?

150
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,963
We're going to try doing the
news, see what happens.

151
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,665
I don't get it.

152
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,100
There are two important
conversations--

153
00:07:43,135 --> 00:07:45,069
how do we do
the best news possible

154
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,871
and how do we get
the most people to watch?

155
00:07:46,905 --> 00:07:48,540
I don't want one
of those conversations

156
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:50,208
to have anything to do
with the other--

157
00:07:50,243 --> 00:07:52,043
You don't want ratings
to drive content.

158
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,611
- Exactly.
- Neither do I.

159
00:07:53,646 --> 00:07:55,980
- I want content to drive ratings.
- That's the hope.

160
00:07:56,014 --> 00:07:58,549
But for the moment, I don't want
ratings in Will's head at all.

161
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,017
I'd be able
to tell him you spiked

162
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:02,587
close to 75,000 new viewers
since you broke your story.

163
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:04,455
- That's 10% in four days.
- Yeah.

164
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,057
In addition to the haul
he brought in

165
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,292
after he went crazy
at Northwestern.

166
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:09,227
- He didn't go crazy.
- I'd be able to tell him

167
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,628
that 32% of those
are in the demo...

168
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:13,165
- Reese.
- and 44% make over 75K,

169
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,834
which means we can
charge more for 15 and 30s

170
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:17,436
and get out of the wheelchair-
selling business.

171
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,271
And what does he do
with that information?

172
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,973
He stretches out the spill
as long as he can.

173
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,509
- That's ratings driving content.
- That's just reality.

174
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,878
- Reese.
- No, I need to be able to do my job.

175
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:29,114
Just don't break down
the numbers for Will.

176
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,851
We've never gotten along
that well, have we?

177
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,555
Reese, don't break down
the numbers for Will.

178
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,659
If I hid in a locked vault
buried under the AWM building,

179
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:43,495
Will would find me so I could
break down the numbers for him

180
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,298
because Will McAvoy is the biggest
ratings whore in the business.

181
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,133
- I'm not the bad guy.
- Nobody's the bad guy.

182
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,336
Though if you call
Will a whore again,

183
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,373
I'm going to take out your
teeth one punch at a time.

184
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,875
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

185
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:02,447
This is a new show
and there are new rules.

186
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:06,818
One: "Is this information
we need in the voting booth?"

187
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:11,189
Two: "Is this the best possible
form of the argument?"

188
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:15,827
And three: "Is the story
in historical context?"

189
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:18,530
You can use a mnemonic device.

190
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:21,967
I-I-I, the three Is.

191
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:24,235
- That's not really helpful.
- I was gonna say.

192
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:27,004
- We're not opening with BP?
- It'll go down in the D block. There's nothing new.

193
00:09:27,038 --> 00:09:29,673
How about today's day four of the
president not saying anything about it?

194
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,075
Would you get off
the man's back?

195
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,977
Jesus Christ.
I'm surprised you found room.

196
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,645
Gary, Kendra.

197
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,715
Gary is the smart black guy who's
not afraid to criticize Obama.

198
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:40,651
Kendra got double 800s
on her SATs, makes Gary crazy.

199
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,686
- I studied.
- BP's going in the D block.

200
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:43,854
Jim.

201
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:46,123
SB 1070 passed
the Arizona House last week

202
00:09:46,158 --> 00:09:48,259
<i>and a few days later</i>
<i>passed the State Senate.</i>

203
00:09:48,293 --> 00:09:52,697
Its official name is the Support Our Law
Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.

204
00:09:52,731 --> 00:09:56,534
It requires immigrants carry their alien
registration documents at all times,

205
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:58,803
requires police question people
if there's reason to suspect

206
00:09:58,837 --> 00:10:00,805
they're in the United States
illegally,

207
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,674
and it targets those who hire
illegal immigrants.

208
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:04,208
The governor signs
the bill today.

209
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:06,810
Is it worth mentioning this is the
same state that offered a bill

210
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:08,746
requiring presidential
candidates to show

211
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,614
their birth certificates
in order to get on the ballot?

212
00:10:10,648 --> 00:10:12,616
In a courtroom, that would
be called "prejudicial."

213
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,117
It would be called
prejudicial anywhere.

214
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:15,452
Nope, not that kind
of prejudicial.

215
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,955
We've got the governor
for nine minutes.

216
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:20,090
- Just us. She's only talking to Will.
- How'd you swing that?

217
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:23,093
- By telling her about "News Night" 2.0.
- You showed her the easel?

218
00:10:23,128 --> 00:10:26,430
I convinced her she's not going to
have to outshout a crazy person.

219
00:10:26,464 --> 00:10:29,533
That studio is a courtroom

220
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:32,903
and we only call
expert witnesses.

221
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:35,138
Will is the attorney
for both sides.

222
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:38,975
He examines the witness
and reveals facts.

223
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,045
You will be amazed
at the guests we'll book

224
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,514
using that unbelievably
obvious template.

225
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,049
You don't have
to raise your hand.

226
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,517
I saw one of those crazy militia
guys on "Jon Stewart" last night.

227
00:10:48,552 --> 00:10:51,354
- We could also have him on.
- Mackenzie: <i>Did you hear me when I was speaking just then</i>

228
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:53,189
or were you distracted
by a bumblebee?

229
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:56,059
What does the I stand for?

230
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:59,896
( all talking at once )

231
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,531
The-- the second I.

232
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:04,367
"Is this the best possible
form of the argument?"

233
00:11:04,401 --> 00:11:06,135
<i>Not the most colorful version,</i>

234
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,570
<i>not the most</i>
<i>outrageous version,</i>

235
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:10,506
but the best possible version.

236
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,009
- How do you define "best"?
- I define it by the source.

237
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:15,878
I define it by the number
of relevant facts it contains,

238
00:11:15,913 --> 00:11:17,914
and I define it by an X factor

239
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,950
that I trust Will
and myself to determine,

240
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:22,119
using our combined
five decades in the field.

241
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,987
What's the best possible version
of the Birther argument?

242
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,523
There isn't one.
And that's the fourth-- ah!

243
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:28,325
This one's an A.

244
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,460
Are there really
two sides to this story?

245
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,664
So it's I-I-I-A.

246
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:35,633
What does that mean,
are there really--

247
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:39,369
The media is biased towards success and
the media is biased towards fairness.

248
00:11:39,404 --> 00:11:41,038
How can you be biased
toward fairness?

249
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,639
There aren't two sides
to every story.

250
00:11:42,674 --> 00:11:45,309
Some stories have five sides,
some only have one.

251
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,111
- You don't have to raise your hand.
- I still don't under--

252
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:50,280
Biased toward fairness means that if the
entire Congressional Republican Caucus

253
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:52,349
were to walk into the House
and propose a resolution

254
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,786
stating that the earth was
flat, the "Times" would lead

255
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,188
with "Democrats and Republicans
Can't Agree on Shape of Earth."

256
00:11:57,223 --> 00:11:59,057
Uh...
( banging )

257
00:11:59,091 --> 00:12:00,993
- Mac?
- Would you let them raise their hands?

258
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:02,995
- Fine.
- Back to immigration.

259
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,730
Neelamani Sampat.
It means "blue jewel."

260
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:07,900
- I didn't know that.
- I did. I took the time. I care.

261
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:10,536
- Are you asking him out?
- If he wants me to. I'm nice.

262
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,804
- And what are you still doing here?
- I was asked to help.

263
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,007
Don generously volunteered
to help during the transition.

264
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,442
- He was asked or he volunteered?
- I'm happy to go.

265
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:18,609
- Apologize.
- I'm sorry.

266
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,011
- Mackenzie: <i>To Don.</i>
- I'm over it.

267
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:21,212
Neal.

268
00:12:21,246 --> 00:12:23,347
There is an alternative
weekly in Spokane

269
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:25,849
<i>called the "Pacific</i>
<i>Northwest Insider"</i>

270
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:28,652
that published an article about
immigration a couple of weeks ago.

271
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:31,222
The story featured a guy
named Hector Nunez

272
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,257
who revealed that
when he was 16,

273
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:35,426
his parents told him that
he was living here illegally.

274
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,827
The paper used his real name?

275
00:12:36,862 --> 00:12:38,663
Yeah, and the state
of Washington rescinded

276
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:40,831
his driver's license
after the piece came out.

277
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:44,969
He needs his car to get to his
job with a small moving company

278
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,104
and to take his kids
to school in the morning.

279
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,906
I thought we could have him on.

280
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,607
I've got to budget 42 minutes.

281
00:12:50,675 --> 00:12:53,277
I've already spent 18
on Jan Brewer and La Raza.

282
00:12:53,311 --> 00:12:55,245
I thought we could put
a human face on immigration.

283
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,381
How about putting a human face
on the guy whose job he took?

284
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:58,917
Mackenzie:
<i>We don't have the time.</i>

285
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,720
We've got 1070, BP,
and a Senate candidate

286
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,489
who says poor people can pay
doctors with chickens.

287
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:05,725
But even if we did have the time, it
would be emotionally manipulative.

288
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,293
- How?
- We'd be putting him there

289
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:08,794
so that we can feel
sorry for him.

290
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,630
We should feel sorry for him.
He's getting screwed.

291
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,399
You should feel sorry
for the guy whose job he took.

292
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,967
I don't want to feel
sorry for anybody.

293
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,403
I want the facts, and neither
of them can provide facts.

294
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:19,239
- Somebody's gonna book this kid.
- Nobody's gonna book him.

295
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:20,539
Nobody's gonna
have heard of him.

296
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:22,174
It's an alternative
weekly in Spokane.

297
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:25,845
And do you see "What's our
competition doing?" on the easel?

298
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,881
- No, but I wish I did.
- Moving on.

299
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,318
The Dow has ticked down
108 points

300
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,454
on a surprisingly weak
durable-goods orders report

301
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:36,556
from the Commerce Department
that has raised worries...

302
00:13:36,591 --> 00:13:39,626
Listen, I'm not gonna take it
from him in public or private.

303
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,428
- I'm doing you guys a favor.
- I'm sorry.

304
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,063
I understand.
And he knows that.

305
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:44,865
You're cutting "PopWatch"
and "Today on YouTube"?

306
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:46,900
I am. And I know
they're both yours, but--

307
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,435
I don't care that they're mine.

308
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:50,537
I care that they're the most
popular segments on the show.

309
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:53,574
- Look at the minute to minutes.
- Feel free to use them when you and Elliot start at 10:00.

310
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,608
Yeah, there's gonna be nobody left
at 10:00 if you lead off the night

311
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:57,944
with the "Will McAvoy Makes You
Eat Your Vegetables Hour."

312
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:02,815
- Hmm?
- Forget it.

313
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,686
- Maggie.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,722
Mac wants me to supervise your
preinterview with Brewer's office.

315
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:11,191
- I was told.
- All right, you're gonna be talking to a spokesperson.

316
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,828
- I'll call him now.
- I thought maybe we could do a practice run first.

317
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:17,431
Okay, I'd like to say,
with all respect,

318
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,600
that I don't feel I need
to be supervised.

319
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:21,935
- Okay.
- You'll let me do it by myself?

320
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:24,204
No, I just meant okay,
I heard you say that.

321
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,373
I've been here a year.
You've been here three days.

322
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,476
Mac's working with a group of relatively
inexperienced people she doesn't know.

323
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,710
- I know that.
- All right.

324
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,712
- So you'll let me do it myself?
- No.

325
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,348
- Then I'm doing this under protest.
- I'm sorry?

326
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,751
I'm just-- I'll be--
I'm doing this under protest.

327
00:14:37,785 --> 00:14:39,719
- What does that look like?
- It'll be the same.

328
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,521
I'm just lodging
an official protest.

329
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,623
- With who?
- My immediate superior, I guess.

330
00:14:43,657 --> 00:14:46,025
- That's me.
- Well, are you writing it down?

331
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,194
No. Are you really
considering going to 10:00?

332
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,931
- Don made some compelling arguments.
- Yeah? What were they?

333
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:53,933
That growing something from scratch
is something I should experience.

334
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:56,536
- ( laughs ) Okay.
- Whoa, whoa, wait.

335
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,604
- What did that mean?
- Nothing.

336
00:14:57,638 --> 00:14:58,671
- Really?
- Yeah.

337
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:00,774
I know exactly
what you're thinking.

338
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:02,575
I can't say the same.

339
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,444
- You don't think I'm making a relationship choice?
- No.

340
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,112
That this is just
a temp gig for me

341
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:09,349
until someone puts a ring
on it and I can have kids?

342
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,318
I wasn't saying--
I didn't say any of that.

343
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:14,220
You don't think that I don't have the
same commitment to news that you do?

344
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,489
No.

345
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:18,758
I'll be honest-- because of the
way I phrased those questions,

346
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,927
I wasn't totally clear
on what your answers meant.

347
00:15:20,995 --> 00:15:23,829
I think that you have the same
commitment to the news that I do.

348
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:25,664
I think kids are great.
I used to be one.

349
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:27,467
And I can't remember
the third thing, but--

350
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,068
- Ring, ring.
- Thank you.

351
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:30,636
- Ring, ring.
- Hi, it's Glenn Fisher.

352
00:15:30,671 --> 00:15:32,171
- Glenn Fisher?
- Yes.

353
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:33,806
- That's the spokesperson I'm talking to?
- Yes.

354
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,074
I thought it was John Markell.

355
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,775
Fisher's a press agent
who's doing the preinterview.

356
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,878
Okay.

357
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:41,446
First, you go into iNews
and you look over the questions

358
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,181
the segment producer
put in the rundown.

359
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:46,385
Identify yourself and your news
agency, summarize the segment--

360
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,953
the length,
whether it's live or not,

361
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:50,089
and who we're having on
from the other side.

362
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:53,091
I'm sorry, but don't I first open
my eyes and notice it's a new day?

363
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,559
- What are we talking about here?
- I've done this before.

364
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,128
- Okay.
- What is this magic box in front of me?

365
00:15:57,163 --> 00:15:58,730
Have I done something to you?

366
00:15:58,764 --> 00:16:00,531
I swear I was just thinking
the exact same thing.

367
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,367
I have no idea why
I'm being mean to you.

368
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:03,835
Now that you know that,
do you think you'll stop?

369
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,470
That's the thing--
it doesn't feel like it.

370
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:06,771
I'm just being honest.

371
00:16:06,805 --> 00:16:08,639
I can't ask for more than that,
except rational thought.

372
00:16:08,674 --> 00:16:10,241
- What was that?
- Nothing.

373
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,876
- Ring, ring.
- Hi, it's Glenn Fisher.

374
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,777
Glenn, this is Margaret Jordan.

375
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:16,580
I'm an associate producer at "News
Night" and I'm doing the preinterview

376
00:16:16,614 --> 00:16:18,248
for the governor's
appearance this evening.

377
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:21,552
I know Will's gonna
wanna ask why mean people

378
00:16:21,586 --> 00:16:23,620
tend to pour into your state
like it's a bathtub drain.

379
00:16:23,654 --> 00:16:25,255
Will's not gonna
wanna ask that.

380
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,924
I think they're building the fence
on the wrong side of the state.

381
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,193
Margaret, here in Arizona,
the government can barely pay

382
00:16:30,228 --> 00:16:32,029
for the needs of native-born
poor as it is--

383
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:33,663
welfare, education,
Social Security--

384
00:16:33,698 --> 00:16:35,232
especially when
so many households here

385
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:37,301
are one or two paychecks away
from the poverty line.

386
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:38,769
You're scapegoating
these people.

387
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:41,606
Stop. I just said
illegals cost money.

388
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,042
- Ask the follow-up.
- Okay.

389
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:47,445
Ask it.

390
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,081
My follow-up,
Mr. Fisher, is this--

391
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:53,784
I understand that having undocumented
workers living in the US costs money

392
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,186
and it's a problem we have
to do something about,

393
00:16:56,221 --> 00:16:58,388
but shouldn't it be a point
of pride for Americans

394
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:01,057
that others are willing to uproot
their families just to come here?

395
00:17:01,091 --> 00:17:03,559
The follow-up was
"How much do they cost?"

396
00:17:03,593 --> 00:17:06,429
But, yes, it is a point of pride
that people wanna come to America

397
00:17:06,496 --> 00:17:08,531
and we value our diverse
population in Arizona,

398
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,833
but we just want people to immigrate
legally and become citizens.

399
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:13,669
And I'm sure that's what's behind
the emotion and the vitriol--

400
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:15,972
Americans hate it when people don't
fill out the proper paperwork.

401
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:20,009
- You can't antagonize the--
- <i>I'm gonna ask the right questions, you dweeb!</i>

402
00:17:20,044 --> 00:17:21,911
- And you'll follow up?
- I'll follow up.

403
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:25,816
My point is that whatever side
of this you're on,

404
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,686
the rhetoric we use to talk about
these people who risk their lives

405
00:17:29,721 --> 00:17:31,054
to have a shot
at picking oranges

406
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,256
so their kids have a shot
at not being dead

407
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,358
makes it sound like
we're talking about

408
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:38,095
scraping gum off our shoes.

409
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:42,065
These people chose to take a
huge risk to become Americans

410
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,902
and they deserve a better
descriptor than "illegals."

411
00:17:52,077 --> 00:17:53,911
You don't need me.
You got this one.

412
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,779
Thank you.

413
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:58,449
Sloan: <i>Another story making headlines
this morning is, of course, Greece,</i>

414
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,019
whose prime minister officially
requested activation

415
00:18:01,053 --> 00:18:02,887
of the EU/IMF bailout package,

416
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,922
lifting the euro from
its lowest level of the year

417
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:06,557
and sending
commodity prices soaring.

418
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,793
We'll have that and the rest
of the day's financial news

419
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,428
on "Market Wrap-Up"
at 4:00.

420
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:11,796
I'm Sloan Sabbith.

421
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,265
Let's go out to Diane
and Billy on the West Coast

422
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,834
for Atlantis Hollywood.

423
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,936
Man:
<i>And we're clear.</i>

424
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,575
- Hello.
- Sloan, I'm Mackenzie McHale.

425
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,910
- I know. It's good to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

426
00:18:24,945 --> 00:18:27,546
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. Thanks.

427
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,051
Mackenzie: <i>You know, I was watching you
earlier when you were talking about</i>

428
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:34,487
<i>two companies--</i>
<i>Capital One and, um--</i>

429
00:18:34,522 --> 00:18:36,122
- Baxter.
- Baxter.

430
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,524
And the prompter said, "Both of
whom are hinting at good numbers,"

431
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,193
and you said, "Both of <i>which</i>
are hinting at good numbers."

432
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:43,929
- Was that an accident?
- No. I didn't write that copy.

433
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,332
I changed it to "which"
because "whom" is for people.

434
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:48,234
- Is someone in trouble?
- No.

435
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:51,337
- Do you mind coming into my office for a second?
- Sure.

436
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:54,207
What's the difference between
a corporation and a person?

437
00:18:54,241 --> 00:18:56,409
- Have you ever held a door open for someone?
- Yes.

438
00:18:56,443 --> 00:18:58,311
- Did you ask them for money first?
- No.

439
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,246
- That's the difference.
- That's the right answer.

440
00:19:00,281 --> 00:19:02,916
- Am I taking a test?
- I've asked around and people say

441
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,651
you don't belong here,
that you could be making

442
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,686
a lot more money
as an analyst at Goldman.

443
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,088
Couldn't you be making a lot more
money producing reality television?

444
00:19:09,123 --> 00:19:12,426
I do produce
reality television.

445
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,061
I don't know what to tell you.

446
00:19:14,095 --> 00:19:15,129
I like my job.

447
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,364
Do you feel like
working longer hours?

448
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,433
They talked to me about
doing a morning show

449
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,001
a couple of times,
but I can't do that.

450
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:23,337
I'm not interested in cooking.
I make sandwiches.

451
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:26,440
I get that I don't necessarily look
like it, but I'm an economist.

452
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:29,010
- Thanks, though.
- Yeah, I meant in prime time.

453
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:32,080
I want to give you
five minutes every night

454
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,616
to talk about where we are
and how we got here.

455
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,485
Are you serious?

456
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:39,254
There are people
more qualified than I am.

457
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:41,657
I can put you in touch with some of
the professors that I studied under--

458
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:45,861
Yeah, the thing is they're
not going to have your legs.

459
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:49,598
I'm sorry, but if I'm going to get
people to listen to an economics lesson,

460
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:52,568
I've got to find someone who doesn't
look like George Bernard Shaw.

461
00:19:52,603 --> 00:19:56,006
I would not ask you if I didn't
think you were qualified.

462
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,977
You want me to do pole dancing while
explaining subprime mortgages?

463
00:20:00,011 --> 00:20:01,979
If you're up to it, sure.

464
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:03,580
All right, I get it.

465
00:20:03,615 --> 00:20:05,349
We'll start a conversation
with Will about our goals

466
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:07,217
- and how we're going to get there.
- Great.

467
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:09,454
- I think you and I are going to be good friends.
- I'd like that.

468
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,555
- Me, too.
- Okay.

469
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:12,323
I mean it.
I don't have any friends.

470
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,159
Oh.

471
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:16,327
You know, you're--
you're new in town, so--

472
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:18,363
Yeah. Yeah.

473
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,968
- You know, you and I have something in common.
- What's that?

474
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,404
- I had a boyfriend who cheated on me, too.
- Ah.

475
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:28,307
- The week of our wedding.
- Oh. Oh.

476
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,276
I don't understand.

477
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:35,180
- I know about Will.
- Yeah. Yeah.

478
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:37,983
I still don't understand.

479
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:41,720
Wait, Will didn't cheat on me.

480
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:44,624
- I used to deny it, too.
- Will didn't cheat on me.

481
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,659
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- I can't talk about what happened,

482
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,361
but I can tell you that
Will didn't cheat on me.

483
00:20:48,395 --> 00:20:50,730
- I shouldn't have mentioned anything.
- Sloan, listen to me.

484
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:51,932
Will didn't cheat on me.

485
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,067
Yes, we were together
for two years and we broke up.

486
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:57,004
I can't tell you any more than that, but
he never, ever, never cheated on me.

487
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:58,772
- Who told you that?
- Everybody.

488
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,407
That's what people--
no, no, no.

489
00:21:00,442 --> 00:21:02,043
That-- that's not
what happened.

490
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,978
- You don't have to tell me what happened.
- I can't tell you.

491
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:07,382
He doesn't want anyone in the office to know.
He made me promise.

492
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,318
No, not because--

493
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,886
I can't talk. Ugh!

494
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,122
Even though in this situation,
I think he'd prefer--

495
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:15,591
no, he really doesn't want
the office to know anything.

496
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,393
- He didn't cheat on me.
- I should get back to work.

497
00:21:18,428 --> 00:21:20,496
You need to tell people that.

498
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,231
You're enabling an ass.

499
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:24,066
He's-- whoa.

500
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,435
He's not an ass.

501
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,671
Come here.

502
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,773
Will's not an ass.
He's the opposite of an ass.

503
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:35,411
Even if he did cheat on me, which he
absolutely didn't, he's definitely not an ass.

504
00:21:35,445 --> 00:21:37,279
- Do people think that?
- You had to have known that.

505
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:39,548
I thought they thought
he was gruff, but lovable.

506
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:42,217
- No, they think he's an ass who cheated on you.
- That has to be corrected.

507
00:21:42,252 --> 00:21:44,386
- I have to start the 4:00.
- Okay, okay, okay.

508
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:46,088
You need to do this--

509
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:48,390
you need to go from person
to person and tell them

510
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:50,592
that Will is
an extraordinary man

511
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:52,494
with a heart the size
of a Range Rover,

512
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,764
that there's a-- a long
story that has to do--

513
00:21:55,798 --> 00:21:57,666
a lot to do with me,
but also other things.

514
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,636
I can't tell you the story of his
life, but he's the good guy.

515
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,671
- Will you tell people that?
- Every chance I get.

516
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,473
- You're not going to, right?
- No, I'm not.

517
00:22:05,508 --> 00:22:07,441
Okay.

518
00:22:07,476 --> 00:22:11,312
- Will: We spiked up 9% overall.
- On top of the 7% that came after Northwestern.

519
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:12,780
You played
high school football.

520
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,615
What do you do when you have
a lead late in the game?

521
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,050
My high school never had
to worry about that.

522
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,485
- You protect the lead.
- Man: <i>Will McAvoy!</i>

523
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,288
How do you get used to eating
lunch at 4:00 in the afternoon?

524
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,723
I work from 11:00 to 9:00.
It's across all demos, too.

525
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:25,592
Will McAvoy's the place
to be for all things BP.

526
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:27,327
Hey, I need you
to tell me right now

527
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:29,196
you're not using that
as a promo slug.

528
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,431
We're not, but Brad ground-researched the
hell out of this since Northwestern,

529
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:34,300
and the feedback we keep getting,
especially from 18 to 49s,

530
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:36,236
is just studded
with green flags.

531
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,871
And this isn't Brad
selective-coding, man.

532
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:39,606
We're talking about an actual, bona
fide, audience-driven response

533
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,742
to Northwestern and the way you
handled the breaking news.

534
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,878
I don't see them capping
the well anytime soon.

535
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:45,746
- But you're not leading with it.
- Not tonight.

536
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,382
- It'll be down in the D block.
- It sunk this morning.

537
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,918
We got film of a massive
offshore drilling rig

538
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,352
sinking into
the Gulf of Mexico.

539
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:53,953
We knew that was gonna happen.

540
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,855
People knew the Titanic was gonna
sink when they went to the movie,

541
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,225
but it was cool to watch, which
is why they went to the movie.

542
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,494
Partner, something's going on here
and you gotta tell me what it is.

543
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,796
Look, we're trying
to format a new broadcast

544
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:05,731
that puts a priority
on information voters need,

545
00:23:05,766 --> 00:23:08,267
puts the information in context,
and then tries to present

546
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:10,169
the best possible versions
of competing arguments.

547
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:11,871
Here's what I just heard--
we got a hit show

548
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,774
that just got bigger, so now
we're trying to fix it.

549
00:23:14,808 --> 00:23:16,542
Listen, there's no one
here but me and you.

550
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,911
Is this something you want or
something you got talked into?

551
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:20,680
It's-- no, it's something
I want badly.

552
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:23,082
- I've wanted this since the dawn of time.
- More than numbers?

553
00:23:23,117 --> 00:23:25,685
Weren't you the one that told me that
your audience are your only friends?

554
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,221
I said that after a couple of shots
of some kind of varnish remover

555
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:29,823
at a particularly
low point in my life.

556
00:23:29,857 --> 00:23:31,657
- That was two weeks ago.
- It was a very low point.

557
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,159
- I think it was lower than three weeks ago.
- Will.

558
00:23:33,193 --> 00:23:35,561
Mackenzie thinks I don't have
to sacrifice one for the other.

559
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:37,596
Well, Mackenzie is the expert
on predicting audience trends.

560
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:39,365
No, wait.
She's not, Brad is.

561
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:41,400
- We're not setting out to lose viewers...
- No one ever does.

562
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:42,935
just better news
for the ones we've got.

563
00:23:42,969 --> 00:23:44,670
All right, I'll stop.

564
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,805
Listen, I still want
your advice every day.

565
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,607
My advice today: go to
the conservative websites.

566
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:50,242
- I do.
- You'll see that they like you.

567
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:51,810
They think you're a RINO,
but they like that you don't

568
00:23:51,845 --> 00:23:53,245
take cheap shots
at Sarah Palin.

569
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,913
- Look at the comments section.
- Yeah, I know.

570
00:23:54,948 --> 00:23:57,316
Palin made a statement
about the spill last night.

571
00:23:57,351 --> 00:23:58,818
- It was ridiculous.
- Yes, it was.

572
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,319
It'll be a joke
on every late-night show.

573
00:24:00,353 --> 00:24:01,821
She basically wrote
Letterman's monologue.

574
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:03,122
- So you want my advice?
- Yes.

575
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,891
Be the guy that doesn't
take a shot at her tonight.

576
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:06,359
Well, I won't be
taking a shot at her,

577
00:24:06,393 --> 00:24:07,860
but that's because
I won't be using her.

578
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,729
I'm saying you should use
her, but not to take a shot--

579
00:24:09,763 --> 00:24:10,930
No, she's a private citizen.

580
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:12,632
She doesn't have any
qualifications in this area,

581
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,267
so it's hard with
the new format to justify--

582
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:15,936
Let me tell you what it looks
like when the audience leaves.

583
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,038
I can't jam in a Palin SOT
just to give myself

584
00:24:18,072 --> 00:24:20,006
the opportunity
to not take a shot at her.

585
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,975
If I cross that line, I'm just
saying, "Fuck the whole thing."

586
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:24,144
It looks like this: first you lose
the people who just got here.

587
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:26,212
Then everyone writes that you lost
the people that just got here.

588
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:28,348
That makes people think they're
not at the cool party anymore.

589
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,483
You ever been at Sardi's on
opening night of a Broadway show

590
00:24:30,517 --> 00:24:32,485
five minutes after word gets
out the "Times" panned it?

591
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,020
They leave.

592
00:24:34,054 --> 00:24:36,923
And they never come back, ever.

593
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:38,558
And it happens
in not much more time

594
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:41,394
than it just took me
to describe it.

595
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:43,596
It's conservatives
who watch the news on TV.

596
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,265
Don't pass up an opportunity to
remind them why they don't hate you.

597
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,934
I really want to give
the new format a--

598
00:24:47,968 --> 00:24:49,602
Also, would you do me a favor
and tell Charlie Skinner

599
00:24:49,636 --> 00:24:51,003
that you're the one
who asked for these meetings?

600
00:24:51,037 --> 00:24:52,638
And do you want me
to fix you up with someone

601
00:24:52,672 --> 00:24:54,206
who'll take your mind off
a girl from three years ago?

602
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,875
- No, thank you.
- Palin.

603
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:57,644
- She's married.
- Not to fix you up with.

604
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:59,579
- I'm saying use the Palin SOT.
- I know. It's not gonna happen.

605
00:24:59,613 --> 00:25:03,082
- Mackenzie would cook me and eat me.
- You're the boss.

606
00:25:03,116 --> 00:25:06,685
I'll keep reminding you of that
because I'm not wild about your ex.

607
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,122
Hey, look, her name
is Mackenzie or Miss McHale,

608
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:12,191
and she's reported
more real news in one day

609
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:14,793
than I have in my career.

610
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:17,696
Fuck.

611
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,642
- <i>( phone clacks )</i>
- ( sighs )

612
00:25:33,146 --> 00:25:35,514
- Hi.
- Hello.

613
00:25:35,548 --> 00:25:36,982
Jan Brewer just bailed
on us for tonight.

614
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:39,118
- What are you talking about?
- They canceled.

615
00:25:39,152 --> 00:25:42,254
- She's going on CNN.
- Who-- uh, who's she sending instead?

616
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:45,023
Maggie, no one from the governor's
office is coming on the show.

617
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,958
- What happened with the call?
- Oh, God.

618
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,994
- What happened?
- This can't be because of the call.

619
00:25:49,028 --> 00:25:51,930
- It happened on the call.
- I swear, I kept my personal feelings to myself.

620
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:54,832
I was on the phone
with Glenn Fisher

621
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,401
and it was really
just by the book.

622
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:58,203
Okay, so the preinterview
was going fine...

623
00:25:58,237 --> 00:25:59,504
- Yeah.
- when all of a sudden...?

624
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,439
Things happen, Jim, okay,

625
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,674
that are beyond your super-newsman
powers of understanding.

626
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,911
I wish you had told me that you
dated Glenn Fisher in college.

627
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:08,246
How could you
possibly know that?

628
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,847
He told me, which is
what you should have done.

629
00:26:09,882 --> 00:26:11,415
I know, but I thought
you'd take it away from me.

630
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,017
- I would have.
- And that's why I didn't tell you.

631
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:14,619
You have to tell me.
If you've had a relationship--

632
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:17,055
- It wasn't a relationship! We went out four times.
- Maggie.

633
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:18,823
<i>And now he's the press aide</i>
<i>to the governor of a state</i>

634
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:20,792
that gave us Barry Goldwater
and a football team

635
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,794
that couldn't find the end
zone with an OnStar system.

636
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:24,529
- You're a football fan?
- No, I looked it up.

637
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:25,797
Also, the fourth date
didn't count.

638
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,732
Is the fourth date relevant
to the preinterview?

639
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,102
- It might be.
- What happened on the fourth date?

640
00:26:30,136 --> 00:26:32,304
We went back to his dorm room,

641
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,373
- we started making out a little.
- Uh-huh.

642
00:26:34,407 --> 00:26:36,208
And then there was
a crazy banging on the door.

643
00:26:36,242 --> 00:26:38,243
It was his ex-girlfriend
and she was shouting,

644
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:39,912
"I know you've got
some slut in there!"

645
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,213
- I think she meant me.
- Yeah.

646
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:43,282
And Glenn said,
"Get under the bed."

647
00:26:43,316 --> 00:26:45,117
- Not the closet?
- No room in the closet. It's a dorm.

648
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:48,087
So I got under the bed
and he let his ex-girlfriend in,

649
00:26:48,122 --> 00:26:49,656
and the two of them
patched things up.

650
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,991
- With you under the bed.
- Yeah.

651
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:52,425
When you say
they patched things up...

652
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,361
- Yeah.
- you're saying...

653
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,230
Oh, my God.
They did it, Jim! Okay?

654
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:58,432
They settled their differences.

655
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:00,634
And it didn't take very long,
because as it turns out,

656
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:02,203
- Glenn doesn't take very long.
- Compared to who?

657
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:05,072
( stammering )
Compared to... other people

658
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,607
and what I've read about
in the movies.

659
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,142
- It doesn't matter.
- Five minutes?

660
00:27:08,176 --> 00:27:09,643
I didn't have
a stopwatch on him,

661
00:27:09,677 --> 00:27:12,012
but I know it was under two minutes
because I was holding my breath.

662
00:27:12,046 --> 00:27:14,414
- Is this important?
- I don't know what's important yet.

663
00:27:14,448 --> 00:27:16,549
That's why I'm listening
to this story.

664
00:27:18,652 --> 00:27:20,220
They finished, they left.

665
00:27:20,254 --> 00:27:22,555
- I waited a minute, and then I left.
- Fast forward to the call.

666
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,491
He says the governor would also like
to talk about Arizona doing well

667
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:27,360
on Obama's Race
to the Finish initiative.

668
00:27:27,394 --> 00:27:29,596
- And you say to Glenn...?
- "How appropriate for you."

669
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,264
- Good one.
- Thank you.

670
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,266
You said you didn't inject
any of your personal opinions--

671
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,469
I didn't inject any personal
opinions about the bill.

672
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:37,037
Okay, first of all,
the initiative is called

673
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:39,072
Race to the Top,
not Race to the Finish.

674
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:41,609
I know. That's why I was so
sure God was on my side--

675
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,644
because He teed me up
so perfectly.

676
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,480
- And second, why didn't he--
- Why didn't he get her out of the room?

677
00:27:46,515 --> 00:27:48,482
It was 2:00 in the morning.
What was he gonna say?

678
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:50,618
"Why don't we go
somewhere private and talk"?

679
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,420
They were in his dorm room.
He was stuck.

680
00:27:52,454 --> 00:27:54,121
- There were no options.
- You had an option.

681
00:27:54,156 --> 00:27:55,823
You could have
not hidden under the bed.

682
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:58,659
I made a quick decision. It may
have been the wrong one...

683
00:27:58,693 --> 00:28:01,525
- "It may have been"--
- but once I made it, I had to commit to it.

684
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,227
And I will tell you
something else.

685
00:28:03,261 --> 00:28:06,030
He waited this long to tell us
he was bailing on purpose

686
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:07,964
so we'd get slammed
on getting a replacement.

687
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:10,099
- Do you think?
- Are you being sarcastic?

688
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:12,669
Because, yes, I'm pretty sure
he did this on purpose.

689
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,072
We've got less than
90 minutes to find someone

690
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:18,774
to defend SB 1070
and get them to a studio.

691
00:28:18,808 --> 00:28:20,842
But after the show,
a bunch of us are going over

692
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,410
to the Emerald City
to see the Wizard--

693
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,445
- and maybe he can give you some--
- My brain is fine.

694
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,047
You give me the SATs
right now and I'll take them.

695
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,717
Maybe he'll give you some courage
is what I was going to say.

696
00:28:29,752 --> 00:28:32,153
Please!

697
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:34,588
Tell me what to do.

698
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:37,791
Grab some bookers, whoever's free,
and come into the conference room.

699
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:39,660
- This is an emergency now.
- We'll be right there.

700
00:28:39,695 --> 00:28:40,828
- Maggie.
- Yeah.

701
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:44,899
I don't know anyone
in the world

702
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,202
who would have hidden
under the bed.

703
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:53,175
Martin, Tamara, Kendra,
I need some help.

704
00:28:53,209 --> 00:28:56,278
- What do you need?
- No, I can-- it's no big deal.

705
00:28:56,312 --> 00:28:58,280
I just need--
( wheezes )

706
00:28:58,314 --> 00:28:59,882
Kendra, Tamara, Martin!

707
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:02,517
- Everything all right?
- I can fix it.

708
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,320
Okay.

709
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:09,490
- Mackenzie: <i>What?!</i>
- <i>( phone clacks )</i>

710
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:16,731
- What the hell is going on?
- We lost Jan Brewer.

711
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,432
What? God!

712
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,867
Get someone else
from Brewer's office.

713
00:29:19,902 --> 00:29:22,070
- No, we've lost the whole office.
- What?

714
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,605
- No one from Brewer's office is gonna be coming.
- What the hell happened?

715
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,808
- This is my fault.
- Look, I got into a stupid argument

716
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,476
with a press aide on the phone

717
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,345
and now he's giving
the governor's office

718
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,113
to everybody but us
so he can stick it to me.

719
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:33,581
Are you freaking kidding me?

720
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:36,017
- No, wait. Mac--
- No. That is what happened.

721
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:39,153
Day side's been running Jan Brewer
promos for the last six hours.

722
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:42,324
- Who's replacing her?
- Well, we're obviously late to the buffet,

723
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:45,461
so we basically had to book people
who were close to a satellite dish.

724
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,296
- Oh, boy.
- Dr. Dwayne Sotter.

725
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,599
He's an adjunct professor
at the University of Phoenix.

726
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:53,103
The University of Phoenix is an online university.
It's not in Arizona.

727
00:29:53,137 --> 00:29:55,104
- But you can understand our mistake, right?
- No.

728
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:56,707
He's written several books
on immigration policy.

729
00:29:56,741 --> 00:29:59,076
- Have I heard of any of them?
- They were self-published.

730
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,545
"This Land is My Land,"
"Ambushed,"

731
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,316
and "Don't Make Me Press One
for English in My Own Country."

732
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,217
- That is quite a sacrifice.
- Tamara.

733
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,585
We've got a former
Miss Oklahoma

734
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,754
who was second runner-up in the
Miss USA Pageant this year.

735
00:30:10,788 --> 00:30:12,255
She claims she was
denied first runner-up

736
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,290
because of an answer she gave
regarding illegal immigration.

737
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:15,892
- Ah, the real victim.
- Martin.

738
00:30:15,927 --> 00:30:17,527
Right, the third
is Ross Fernholm,

739
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:19,462
- a former state patrolman who was part...
- Don't say it.

740
00:30:19,497 --> 00:30:21,230
of a border control group
called the "Citizens Militia."

741
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:23,633
Is this or isn't this
the exact opposite

742
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,134
<i>of who I asked you to book?</i>

743
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:26,469
God damn it, Jim!
What the hell were you--

744
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:28,371
- This is all--
- All gonna be fine.

745
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:31,374
- Jim is taking the fall--
- For exactly what I'm supposed to take the fall for.

746
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,176
I don't know what the hell
dance you two are doing.

747
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,578
Don't book these guys.
Scrap the segment.

748
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:37,680
They'll say we didn't have
anyone defending it.

749
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,654
Let's prep them the best we can
and have Will carry them, okay?

750
00:30:44,688 --> 00:30:47,290
<i>He'll just carry them.</i>

751
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:48,824
I'll go and tell him.

752
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:50,626
- I should be the one to tell him.
- Jim: <i>Maggie--</i>

753
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:52,128
- He's gonna fire somebody.
- God knows he should.

754
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:54,363
- He will.
- He won't.

755
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:57,266
He won't.

756
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,037
Guys, he won't.

757
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:03,873
Hang on.

758
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:06,276
Dome of silence.
I have to--

759
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:10,848
Are people here under the
impression that Will is an ass?

760
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,922
Okay, you're wrong.
You know?

761
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:21,225
You're just wrong
and it's an injustice.

762
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:24,429
He's-- he'd throw himself
in front of a train

763
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,464
for anyone in this--

764
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:28,766
- Is Will in his office?
- He's at that thing uptown.

765
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,637
I'm sending him an e-mail
because I-- I can't

766
00:31:32,671 --> 00:31:36,073
live with this
stupid promise I made

767
00:31:36,108 --> 00:31:41,078
and, you know, completely
wrong information.

768
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:43,848
<i>I'm nipping this thing</i>
<i>in the bud right now.</i>

769
00:31:43,883 --> 00:31:46,017
And "send."

770
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:50,054
Will is the best man
I've ever--

771
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:53,091
( cell phones ringing )

772
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:00,434
- What just happened?
- I got a staff e-mail from you.

773
00:32:00,469 --> 00:32:02,703
- Me, too.
- I sent the e-mail to Sloan, I mean Will.

774
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,872
Ah. Oh, my God,
I sent it to Sloan.

775
00:32:04,907 --> 00:32:06,708
I think the S in "Sloan"
became "staff."

776
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:08,543
You used the asterisk.

777
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,015
No.

778
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:18,587
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

779
00:32:18,655 --> 00:32:20,990
Everybody listen!
Listen to me right now.

780
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:23,092
( cell phone rings )

781
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:24,927
( staff gasps )

782
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,695
- Man: <i>Oh, man.</i>
- Man #2: <i>Oh!</i>

783
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,734
That was unusual.

784
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:34,736
I want everyone to delete
the e-mail you just received.

785
00:32:34,771 --> 00:32:37,439
Delete it right now without reading it.
Honor system.

786
00:32:37,473 --> 00:32:40,708
And then I need someone
to sneak into Will's office

787
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:42,777
and delete the e-mail
from his inbox.

788
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:45,279
If it's password-protected,

789
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:49,149
I need you to take
a baseball bat and smash--

790
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,490
- You told me he was uptown.
- I guess he came back.

791
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:02,462
- We stood in my office...
- Will.

792
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:05,798
this morning, and I said
under no circumstances

793
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:09,002
do I want anyone here
to know what happened.

794
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:12,204
And you said yes,
and yes again.

795
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,840
And it-- it really--

796
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:17,910
it really seemed like
you understood.

797
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:21,113
- And then you sent an e-mail...
- It was a complete--

798
00:33:21,147 --> 00:33:25,250
- explaining in some detail what happened.
- Please, please let me--

799
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:28,186
And then you copied
47 reporters on it.

800
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,521
Can we go into your office?

801
00:33:29,555 --> 00:33:31,790
You know how sometimes something
happens in an instant

802
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:34,827
that's so astonishing
you just shut down?

803
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:39,698
- Of course, that's underst--
- That doesn't fucking happen to me!

804
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:43,468
- We need some privacy.
- Really?!

805
00:33:43,503 --> 00:33:45,137
We're going to go
into Will's office,

806
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,173
but I want everyone
to delete the e-mail.

807
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,175
Mac, I think I just accidentally
forwarded it to corporate.

808
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,511
- ( staff gasping )
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

809
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:54,713
- Why is this happening?
- I was sending an e-mail to you,

810
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:56,181
but accidentally sent it
to Sloan Sabbith,

811
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:57,749
but I either did or didn't
type the asterisk

812
00:33:57,784 --> 00:33:59,351
and it went to staff
instead of Sloan.

813
00:33:59,385 --> 00:34:01,053
Why were you sending it at all?

814
00:34:01,087 --> 00:34:03,522
Because-- and here's where
I think I'm on firmer ground--

815
00:34:03,556 --> 00:34:06,358
she thought that
you cheated on me

816
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,194
and that you were an ass,
which is not true.

817
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:10,496
I'm changing minds, Will.

818
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:12,031
I'm changing minds
all over the place.

819
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:13,866
- Get in there!
- Sure.

820
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:19,873
She thought you cheated on me and she
told me other people thought so, too.

821
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:22,175
I couldn't take that,
but I do take 100%

822
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,910
of the responsibility
for what just happened.

823
00:34:23,945 --> 00:34:25,845
Who else would be responsible?

824
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,246
Arizona prison stats.

825
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:29,182
- Thank you.
- No one. I'm sorry.

826
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:31,416
- Don't mention it.
- That's--

827
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:34,019
I'm really impressed that
you're forgiving me so fast.

828
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:36,689
- I would have--
- No, what you heard was, "Don't mention it.

829
00:34:36,723 --> 00:34:38,223
It's no problem.
Don't worry about it."

830
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:40,025
What I said was,
"Don't mention it ever."

831
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:41,526
- Will--
- Ever, Mac!

832
00:34:41,561 --> 00:34:43,428
- Hospital costs and health care.
- How current?

833
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:44,997
- Fiscal 2009.
- Thank you.

834
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:46,732
I understand.

835
00:34:46,766 --> 00:34:48,834
One more thing.

836
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:51,370
We lost Jan Brewer
and had to replace her

837
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:54,473
with a crazy professor at a website,
a member of the Citizens Militia,

838
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:56,676
and a former second runner-up
in the Miss USA Pageant.

839
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,411
It's going to be fine.
You'll carry them.

840
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:00,212
They'll barely have to speak.

841
00:35:02,516 --> 00:35:04,083
Now you've shut down, right?

842
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:06,285
Ha ha.

843
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:07,786
Who fucked up?

844
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:11,023
- Now, you know I'm not going to tell you that.
- Okay.

845
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,294
- 98%.
- What?

846
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,630
I take 98% of the
responsibility, not 100%.

847
00:35:18,664 --> 00:35:20,565
Is that right?

848
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,533
Listen...

849
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:25,669
you were in love
from the day you met me,

850
00:35:25,704 --> 00:35:27,138
and for two years
you were the man

851
00:35:27,172 --> 00:35:28,606
of any woman's dreams,
you know?

852
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:33,311
You'd have these ways
of doing things.

853
00:35:35,447 --> 00:35:37,448
It doesn't matter.

854
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:40,951
I didn't know that I was in
love with you, too, until--

855
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:42,653
You cheated on me
with your ex-boyfriend.

856
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,554
That's right!
That's what happened.

857
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,491
I didn't know how I felt about
you until I was with him again.

858
00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:50,093
So technically, I wasn't
cheating on the man I loved,

859
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,629
I was falling in love
with the man I loved.

860
00:35:52,663 --> 00:35:55,532
- While cheating on him with your ex-boyfriend.
- Yes!

861
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,868
But you're missing that technically
it wasn't cheating, though.

862
00:35:57,902 --> 00:36:00,103
The more important thing is
that I fell in love with you.

863
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:01,605
At the end of a romantic comedy

864
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,140
that would make
everything okay!

865
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,242
There's something I've always
been dying to ask you.

866
00:36:05,276 --> 00:36:08,712
- Ask anything.
- Why did you tell me?

867
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:12,549
- Because I wouldn't have been able to live with it.
- Now I have to live with it.

868
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:15,819
- Would you rather I'd have been dishonest?
- Yes!

869
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,659
Yes, I'd very much rather

870
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:24,662
you hadn't told me.

871
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:31,202
Still, 98%.

872
00:36:31,237 --> 00:36:32,971
<i>( door opens )</i>

873
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:35,006
I'm sorry, we have to do
the final rundown.

874
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,442
We're coming.

875
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:40,412
The first runner-up
wasn't available?

876
00:36:44,651 --> 00:36:46,819
Herb:
<i>60 seconds to VTR.</i>

877
00:36:46,853 --> 00:36:48,688
Are we getting
the opening in HD or SD?

878
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:50,723
Herb: <i>Where's it coming to me?
Which router?</i>

879
00:36:50,757 --> 00:36:52,391
<i>Roll it in from the room.</i>

880
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:54,427
Tess.

881
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:56,328
There's an SOT I want
in the D block--

882
00:36:56,363 --> 00:36:57,797
Sarah Palin's comment
on the White House

883
00:36:57,831 --> 00:36:59,365
not returning calls
from the Dutch,

884
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,233
except she calls
Holland Norway.

885
00:37:01,268 --> 00:37:02,701
Find it, give it to Jake.

886
00:37:02,736 --> 00:37:04,903
- Don't run it past Mac.
- Yes, sir.

887
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,541
Did we go to Afghanistan
because you cheated on Will?

888
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:11,110
- Can I get a little privacy?
- Not until you learn how to send an e-mail.

889
00:37:11,144 --> 00:37:13,680
- You got invaluable experience.
- I got shot in the ass.

890
00:37:13,714 --> 00:37:15,481
Well, be grateful you weren't
facing the other direction.

891
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:17,450
Herb:
<i>30 seconds out.</i>

892
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:21,589
I've been cheated on.

893
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,192
One time literally
right on top of me.

894
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:28,863
This happened because of me.
No one should get fired.

895
00:37:28,897 --> 00:37:32,266
I can resign, and it's fine
because Don wants me at 10:00.

896
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,403
I hope you don't do that.

897
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:37,572
I hope you stay here.

898
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:40,375
Good show.

899
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:42,877
Herb: <i>Can you move his
BlackBerry off the desk?</i>

900
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:45,045
- I can see it in the shot.
- Will.

901
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,449
Can you move your
BlackBerry off the desk?

902
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:50,118
Men: Oh!

903
00:37:50,152 --> 00:37:52,520
That wouldn't have happened if he'd
had one of those rubber protectors.

904
00:37:52,554 --> 00:37:54,355
- Herb: Does 3 have to change lenses?
- Jake: <i>No, we're good.</i>

905
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,992
Herb: <i>In four, three, two.
Roll VTR.</i>

906
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:01,463
<i>( music playing )</i>

907
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:11,139
Good evening.
I'm Will McAvoy.

908
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:13,341
Deepwater Horizon
continues to spill oil

909
00:38:13,376 --> 00:38:15,044
<i>even as it sinks into the Gulf,</i>

910
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:17,179
a Republican candidate
for Senate in Nevada advocates

911
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,314
poor people paying
doctors with chickens,

912
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:22,250
and Greece activates
a $45 billion aid package.

913
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,553
<i>But we begin tonight in Arizona</i>

914
00:38:24,587 --> 00:38:28,257
where Governor Jan Brewer today
signed into law SB 1070,

915
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,292
which allows police
to ask for documentation

916
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,029
from anyone suspected of being
in the country illegally.

917
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,931
Our coverage begins
with Rachel Sachs

918
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:36,833
at the statehouse
in Phoenix. Rachel?

919
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:39,302
I have no idea
if the president even knows

920
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:42,272
that an entire Exxon Valdez is spilling
into the Gulf every four days.

921
00:38:42,306 --> 00:38:43,707
Are you really not sure?

922
00:38:43,741 --> 00:38:45,075
Because that would make you
dumber than previous estimates.

923
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:46,210
Would the two of you shut up?

924
00:38:46,244 --> 00:38:48,078
- Both: Sorry.
- I miss my BlackBerry.

925
00:38:48,112 --> 00:38:50,714
Joining us tonight from
Washington is Daniel Mendoza,

926
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:52,949
Deputy Director of the
National Council of La Raza,

927
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:56,419
<i>the largest Hispanic civil
rights organization in the US.</i>

928
00:38:56,454 --> 00:38:59,656
- Good evening, Mr. Mendoza.
- Thanks for inviting me here to speak to you, Will.

929
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,124
Let's jump right in.

930
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,893
Estimates are that
illegal immigrants

931
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:05,796
cost Arizonans
$2.7 billion a year.

932
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,331
- Is that a problem worth fixing?
- Of course it is.

933
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:10,567
But if it's an economic issue,
you need to consider that

934
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,669
deporting 12 million
undocumented workers

935
00:39:12,703 --> 00:39:17,073
will drain 2.5 trillion over the
next 10 years from our GDP.

936
00:39:17,108 --> 00:39:20,410
Arizona residents overwhelmingly
favor spending that money.

937
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,778
Back in two minutes.

938
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:23,680
- We don't have 1705.
- Joey.

939
00:39:31,355 --> 00:39:33,156
Herb:
<i>30 seconds out.</i>

940
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,059
- We know this next segment's going to be a problem.
- Really?

941
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:39,163
Why do you automatically assume
that a hospitality management major

942
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:43,534
won't be able to speak with
sophistication about constitutional law?

943
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:46,337
Make sure everybody knows this
is what blowing it looks like.

944
00:39:46,371 --> 00:39:47,738
They know.

945
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:52,710
Herb:
<i>20 out.</i>

946
00:39:52,744 --> 00:39:54,545
It's gonna be fine.

947
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,148
The PhD is cool
with illegal immigrants

948
00:39:57,182 --> 00:40:00,484
as long as they're checked for
diseases like smallpox and gayness.

949
00:40:00,518 --> 00:40:03,154
I'm not sure I gave Will
the best form of the argument.

950
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:05,923
- Didn't we cure small--
- Yes.

951
00:40:05,957 --> 00:40:07,224
15 back.

952
00:40:07,258 --> 00:40:09,092
Does the militia guy really
want his gun in the shot?

953
00:40:09,127 --> 00:40:10,327
I asked him that and he said,

954
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:11,661
<i>"This isn't a gun,</i>
<i>it's a rifle.</i>

955
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:14,364
And this rifle has a name,
and her name is Jenny."

956
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:16,566
If you keep covering for people,
I don't know who can do what.

957
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,434
- I wasn't covering.
- You've got a crush on this girl.

958
00:40:18,468 --> 00:40:20,336
You told me to.
And, no, I don't.

959
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:22,605
In three, two.
Cue Will.

960
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,040
Welcome back.

961
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,443
We're discussing Arizona's
immigration bill SB 1070,

962
00:40:26,477 --> 00:40:29,112
<i>the Support Our Law Enforcement</i>
<i>and Safe Neighborhoods Act,</i>

963
00:40:29,147 --> 00:40:31,748
which was signed into law today
by Governor Jan Brewer.

964
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:33,116
Joining me now by satellite

965
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:35,385
<i>are three strong supporters</i>
<i>of the new law:</i>

966
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,054
Dr. Dwayne Sotter,
an academic

967
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,589
who's written extensively
about immigration policy;

968
00:40:39,624 --> 00:40:41,925
Ross Fernholm, a former
Arizona State Patrolman

969
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,795
who now runs the all-volunteer
Independence Border Guards in Yuma;

970
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,532
<i>and Gwen Lalley, a junior</i>
<i>at the University of New Mexico</i>

971
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,435
<i>and the second runner-up in</i>
<i>last night's Miss USA Pageant,</i>

972
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:52,437
who was asked about
this very issue onstage

973
00:40:52,471 --> 00:40:54,573
and who believes her answer
was what kept her from winning.

974
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:55,874
<i>Thank you all for being here.</i>

975
00:40:55,908 --> 00:40:57,375
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

976
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,810
Will, I wanna be
very clear--

977
00:40:58,844 --> 00:41:00,212
my answer didn't
keep me from winning,

978
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:02,247
it kept me from being
first runner-up.

979
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:04,116
- And we're off.
- Okay. Ahem.

980
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,117
Dr. Sotter, this is
your field of expertise,

981
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:07,619
<i>so let's kick it off with you.</i>

982
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:10,121
What do you say to those
who argue that SB 1070

983
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:13,891
is just targeting Americans on the basis
of skin color and nationality alone?

984
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,459
Absolutely, Will.

985
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:17,228
What would you say to them?

986
00:41:17,262 --> 00:41:18,796
I'd say absolutely.

987
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:20,865
The bill does not target
religion or Muslims

988
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:24,068
or homosexuality,
just illegal Mexicans.

989
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:26,604
Well, yes, but you would
also say, right,

990
00:41:26,638 --> 00:41:29,106
that the state legislature
has taken great pains

991
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:32,109
to ensure that it isn't
a racial profiling law,

992
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:35,179
even going so far as to amend it
to include the following language.

993
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:38,082
- Go 24.
- "Prosecutors would not investigate complaints

994
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:40,418
based on race, color,
or national origin."

995
00:41:40,452 --> 00:41:42,621
That's right, just Mexicans.

996
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:45,823
- Dr. Sotter--
- Forgive me, Will. Latinos and Latinas.

997
00:41:45,858 --> 00:41:48,459
Will: <i>And the argument that
we don't want to be a country</i>

998
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:51,696
that pulls people over and asks for
their papers based on how they look?

999
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,397
Yeah, I don't like it
any more than you do,

1000
00:41:53,432 --> 00:41:54,899
but that wouldn't be the case

1001
00:41:54,933 --> 00:41:58,202
if it weren't for
the Latinos and Latinas,

1002
00:41:58,236 --> 00:42:01,505
el "criminelos,"
los "ilegatos."

1003
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:03,340
That's not Spanish.

1004
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:05,208
<i>Ahem, Gwen, let's go to you.</i>

1005
00:42:05,243 --> 00:42:06,877
You were asked last night
about the immigration law

1006
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:08,779
and you said it was an issue
of states' rights.

1007
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:10,313
And for that I paid a price.

1008
00:42:10,348 --> 00:42:13,583
That notwithstanding,
you raised an interesting issue.

1009
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:16,019
This law will surely
be challenged in the courts

1010
00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:17,721
on constitutional grounds.

1011
00:42:17,756 --> 00:42:20,591
After all, states aren't allowed to
create their own foreign policy,

1012
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,827
but it sounds like you've got
the right answer to that.

1013
00:42:22,861 --> 00:42:26,197
- Which is...?
- I'm a survivor and I don't know the word "quit."

1014
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:27,499
- Probably other words, too.
- Shut it.

1015
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:29,067
Ahem, states aren't
allowed to create

1016
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:31,669
their own foreign policy,
but...?

1017
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:36,541
But this isn't about
foreign policy,

1018
00:42:36,575 --> 00:42:38,209
it's about law enforcement.

1019
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,548
Decades of federal inaction
have led to a dangerous

1020
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,218
and unstable situation
on Arizona's border.

1021
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:49,488
And if the federal government can't,
or won't, act to uphold the law,

1022
00:42:49,522 --> 00:42:52,658
then it's up to the states to exercise
their power and fill that void.

1023
00:42:52,692 --> 00:42:55,294
I'm an Ameri-can, Will,
not an Ameri-can't.

1024
00:42:55,328 --> 00:42:56,595
- Let's dump out of it.
- Ross.

1025
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,197
- Ross: <i>Yes.</i>
- No, the whole thing, dump out of it.

1026
00:42:58,231 --> 00:42:59,598
I'm gonna go ahead and assume

1027
00:42:59,633 --> 00:43:01,567
<i>that you're a supporter</i>
<i>of Second Amendment rights,</i>

1028
00:43:01,601 --> 00:43:04,737
- <i>judging by the rifle you've placed in your live shot.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1029
00:43:04,772 --> 00:43:07,407
A frequent argument you hear
from gun rights advocates

1030
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:09,710
is that we don't need
any more new laws;

1031
00:43:09,744 --> 00:43:13,380
what we need is a government to
enforce the laws we already have.

1032
00:43:13,415 --> 00:43:15,916
Couldn't the same be said
about immigration policy?

1033
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:17,752
Yes, sir.

1034
00:43:17,786 --> 00:43:21,089
I'm saying you're a supporter
of the new law, right?

1035
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:23,258
- Ross: <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- I can't take my eyes off of it.

1036
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:25,026
Because?

1037
00:43:26,929 --> 00:43:30,297
Because laws that are unwieldy and
unenforceable aren't laws at all.

1038
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:31,798
- Ross: <i>I don't follow.</i>
- Dump out of it.

1039
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:33,367
- Ross: <i>And, Mr. McAdoo--</i>
- McAvoy.

1040
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:35,001
- I beg your pardon?
- Doesn't matter.

1041
00:43:35,036 --> 00:43:36,769
Why don't we just
build a damn wall?

1042
00:43:36,804 --> 00:43:38,737
The Chinese built one
and you can see it from space.

1043
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:41,173
- <i>Are the Chinese better than us?</i>
- No.

1044
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:43,608
Although there's an old
saying-- show me a 15-foot wall

1045
00:43:43,643 --> 00:43:45,277
and I'll show you
a 16-foot ladder.

1046
00:43:45,311 --> 00:43:46,712
Then let's just build
a 17-foot wall.

1047
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:49,514
- Hell, build it 18 feet.
- Will: Yes. Yep.

1048
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:52,151
- But you see their point, right?
- Whose point?

1049
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:53,619
The people who build ladders.

1050
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:56,089
- Ross: <i>How about we get...</i>
- I'm sorry, okay?

1051
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:58,991
- I'm sorry. Just dump out of it.
- Will, can I jump in?

1052
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:00,626
- She cannot jump in.
- Jump on in, Gwen.

1053
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,895
- Gwen: <i>I think we're creating an environment...</i>
- Ugh!

1054
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:04,730
where pageant contestants
are afraid to speak their minds

1055
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:07,633
when it comes to important
questions and whatnot,

1056
00:44:07,667 --> 00:44:09,469
<i>and that's not the America</i>
<i>I grew up in.</i>

1057
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:11,872
You're 20 years old. It is
the America you grew up in.

1058
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:13,707
- Not in Oklahoma.
- Especially in Oklahoma.

1059
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:15,275
<i>But we're gonna</i>
<i>have to leave it there.</i>

1060
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:17,177
When we come back,
Deepwater Horizon

1061
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:18,979
sinks to the bottom
of the Gulf of Mexico.

1062
00:44:19,013 --> 00:44:22,715
- <i>( music playing )</i>
- I envy it.

1063
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,284
...with the White House now
getting offers of assistance

1064
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,753
from other countries to help
plug the gushing well.

1065
00:44:27,788 --> 00:44:29,655
What's this new SOT?
What's 907?

1066
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,791
- Will gave it to me last minute.
- What is it?

1067
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:33,826
It's Sarah Palin on the spill.

1068
00:44:33,861 --> 00:44:35,795
Will: <i>Former Alaskan governor and vice
presidential candidate Sarah Palin</i>

1069
00:44:35,829 --> 00:44:37,764
weighed in earlier today
on Fox News.

1070
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:39,232
- Go 907.
- <i>( button clicks )</i>

1071
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:41,401
Well, then, what the federal
government should have done

1072
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,637
was accept the assistance
of foreign countries,

1073
00:44:44,672 --> 00:44:47,507
of entrepreneurial Americans
who have had solutions

1074
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:49,309
- <i>that they wanted presented.</i>
- Bill O'Reilly: <i>Who?</i>

1075
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:52,212
Palin: <i>They can't even get</i>
<i>a phone call returned, Bill.</i>

1076
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:53,580
The Dutch.
They are known--

1077
00:44:53,614 --> 00:44:56,617
in the Norwegian--
they are known for dikes

1078
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:59,420
and for cleaning up water
and for dealing with spills.

1079
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:01,956
<i>They offered to help,</i>
<i>and yet, no, they, too,</i>

1080
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,225
with the proverbial can't even
get a phone call back.

1081
00:45:04,259 --> 00:45:07,895
Okay, what she was saying
was that...

1082
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,330
All yours.

1083
00:45:09,364 --> 00:45:11,065
<i>yes, okay, the Dutch</i>
<i>live in Holland</i>

1084
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,600
and Norwegians live in Norway.

1085
00:45:12,634 --> 00:45:14,802
That's a mistake that--
people make that.

1086
00:45:14,836 --> 00:45:16,703
<i>And I think Governor Palin</i>
<i>was referring</i>

1087
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:18,972
to an old fairy tale
about a boy--

1088
00:45:19,006 --> 00:45:22,008
she was saying that people were
offering to help, and that's great,

1089
00:45:22,042 --> 00:45:24,210
and phone calls
will be returned.

1090
00:45:26,246 --> 00:45:27,847
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

1091
00:45:32,486 --> 00:45:35,354
Charlie:
<i>William Duncan McAvoy.</i>

1092
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:37,089
I think your parents
wanted to make it

1093
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:39,292
plainly understood
that you are Anglo-Saxon.

1094
00:45:39,326 --> 00:45:41,893
I came up to personally
apologize for tonight's show.

1095
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:43,495
The show kind of got away
from you a little.

1096
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:44,963
It bordered on unprofessional.

1097
00:45:44,998 --> 00:45:46,531
Here's unprofessional,

1098
00:45:46,566 --> 00:45:48,067
here's the border,
and here's professional,

1099
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:49,835
and all the way back here
is tonight's show.

1100
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:53,171
- It was my fault.
- Yeah.

1101
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,741
Did you know I got an e-mail
from Mackenzie today saying--

1102
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:58,611
God. Yeah. I forgot you
were gonna see that.

1103
00:45:58,645 --> 00:46:00,313
Know how many people
work at this company?

1104
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:02,482
Well, in the cable news
division, I guess about 350.

1105
00:46:02,516 --> 00:46:04,384
178,000.

1106
00:46:04,418 --> 00:46:08,421
Guys who sell jet engines
got that e-mail.

1107
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:10,957
By the way, they also own
a tabloid magazine.

1108
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:14,127
( both laughing )

1109
00:46:20,635 --> 00:46:22,435
I'm inured to it.
It happened.

1110
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:23,970
How's gossip gonna be worse?

1111
00:46:24,005 --> 00:46:27,440
It's been three years.
Time hasn't helped?

1112
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:30,343
No.

1113
00:46:30,378 --> 00:46:31,811
I wish you had told me.

1114
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:33,246
What would you have said?

1115
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,315
- I'd have made you feel better.
- How?

1116
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:37,584
I don't know.
I do it all the time.

1117
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:42,689
Get it together
down there, fast.

1118
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:46,793
- Got it.
- One more thing.

1119
00:46:46,827 --> 00:46:49,596
Your daily private meetings
with Reese are over.

1120
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:51,932
Charlie, I respect you
more than anyone I know,

1121
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,601
but I'm the one
sitting in that chair.

1122
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:57,604
Yes, you are.

1123
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:04,678
People across America
are watching Arizona,

1124
00:47:04,712 --> 00:47:07,481
seeing how
we implement this law,

1125
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:10,083
ready to jump on even
the slightest misstep.

1126
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,854
Reporter: <i>Many opponents
aren't even waiting for that.</i>

1127
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:15,489
You need a drink?

1128
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:18,725
Sure.

1129
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:21,662
There's a karaoke bar
down the street we go to.

1130
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:24,498
Drinks and appetizers
are $3 until 9:00.

1131
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:25,967
It's 9:15.

1132
00:47:26,035 --> 00:47:28,637
We sent an intern down
at 8:55 to order 30 drinks

1133
00:47:28,671 --> 00:47:31,239
and four platters
of tuna jerky.

1134
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:35,711
The downside's the karaoke, but it's the
only place nearby that stays open late

1135
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:37,713
unless you want to go
to the theater district.

1136
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:39,182
I'd have thought
the downside would be

1137
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:41,351
the four platters
of tuna jerky.

1138
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:43,286
It's an affordable dinner.

1139
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,357
( sighs ) Let's go.

1140
00:47:47,392 --> 00:47:49,026
( patting )

1141
00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:57,634
- Are you in or are you out?
- What?

1142
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:01,772
Are you in or are you out?

1143
00:48:01,806 --> 00:48:04,575
- Are we doing this, then?
- I don't understand. Are you mad at me right now?

1144
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:07,912
Palin. How did Palin
get into the rundown?

1145
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:09,447
First of all, I'm the EP.
Don't slip--

1146
00:48:09,481 --> 00:48:11,715
I'm the managing editor and I
don't need your permission--

1147
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,952
Yes, you do, and you didn't ask for it
'cause you knew you wouldn't get it.

1148
00:48:14,986 --> 00:48:17,088
I made it clear that this show
isn't going to participate

1149
00:48:17,122 --> 00:48:19,557
in the endless cycle of
codependency between Palin...

1150
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:21,359
- I know.
- and insult to injury.

1151
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:24,029
You twisted yourself into
a Windsor knot to save her.

1152
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,399
( deep voice ) "I'm sure
that what the governor meant

1153
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:31,736
was that the Dutch living
in Norwegia have good ideas.

1154
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:33,538
And since she has
an intimate knowledge

1155
00:48:33,573 --> 00:48:35,807
of all calls going into
and out of the White House,

1156
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:39,210
she's a credible source
on whether the Swedisians

1157
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:40,712
have gotten
their message returned."

1158
00:48:40,746 --> 00:48:42,480
First of all,
the impression-- uncanny.

1159
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,250
I'm not the one who asked
Victoria's Secret

1160
00:48:45,284 --> 00:48:47,452
to do five minutes of economic
reporting every night.

1161
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:50,522
Victoria's Secret has a PhD
in economics from Duke

1162
00:48:50,556 --> 00:48:52,391
and is an adjunct professor
at Columbia.

1163
00:48:52,425 --> 00:48:53,859
Are you in or are you out?

1164
00:48:53,893 --> 00:48:56,194
I have to give you credit for
thinking you can chew me out

1165
00:48:56,229 --> 00:48:58,063
- on this particular--
- I'll chew you out on any particular day.

1166
00:48:58,097 --> 00:49:01,366
And by the way, when I say dump
out of it, dump out of it.

1167
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,235
Reese got in your head.

1168
00:49:03,269 --> 00:49:05,370
And so you put
the almost-one-term governor

1169
00:49:05,405 --> 00:49:07,273
of a state where
nobody lives on our air.

1170
00:49:07,307 --> 00:49:10,510
- I'm don't believe I'm hearing--
- Yes, we fucked up

1171
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:13,747
on a huge subject,
but ours was a mistake.

1172
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:16,083
Yours was fear,

1173
00:49:16,117 --> 00:49:19,053
a need to be loved by
strangers and not our show.

1174
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:22,891
Be the leader, Will.

1175
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:26,294
Be the moral center
of this show.

1176
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:28,663
Be the integrity.

1177
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:34,135
Today's Friday.

1178
00:49:34,169 --> 00:49:37,773
By Monday I want to know
are you in or are you out?

1179
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,351
Does anyone believe
I just got--

1180
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,753

00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,740
We want to be
the ones to do 2.0.

1187
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,008
We can do this.

1188
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:19,015
Give me a second.
( clears throat )

1189
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,356
How you doing?

1190
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,692
I'm doing all right,
all rings consisted--

1191
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:30,926
considered.
( laughs )

1192
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,562
<i>( Don laughs ) How much
have you had to drink?</i>

1193
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:36,265
I won't lie to you, Don.

1194
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,100
- Yes?
- What?

1195
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:40,202
You said, "I won't lie to you, Don,"
and then you didn't say anything else.

1196
00:50:40,236 --> 00:50:41,903
- I've had a drink.
- A whole one?

1197
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,038
- Yeah.
- That's too much for you.

1198
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:47,007
- It is not.
- Come to 10:00.

1199
00:50:47,042 --> 00:50:49,844
I really appreciate your offer,

1200
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:54,015
but I think you're offering it
because I'm your girlfriend.

1201
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:56,083
What's wrong with that?

1202
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,919
Owww.

1203
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:00,288
You're supposed to say,
"No, I'm not."

1204
00:51:00,322 --> 00:51:02,389
You're just inexperienced.
I will coach you up.

1205
00:51:02,424 --> 00:51:04,959
I want to be a part of what Will
and Mackenzie are trying to do.

1206
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:08,829
- Will and Mackenzie are gonna fail.
- Jesus Christ, what's--

1207
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:12,466
just because the scenery fell down
doesn't mean it's not a good play.

1208
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:15,270
Yeah, I don't know what that meant,
but I'm not talking about tonight.

1209
00:51:15,304 --> 00:51:17,472
Nobody's gonna
watch a classroom.

1210
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:20,608
They'll either be bored or infuriated
and you will bleed viewers.

1211
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,710
And my show with Elliot
will get moved to 8:00.

1212
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:25,513
And at that point, I don't know
that I'll be able to help you.

1213
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:27,748
- It was your fault.
- Let's break up.

1214
00:51:27,783 --> 00:51:30,351
- What did I do now?
- You were too supportive.

1215
00:51:30,385 --> 00:51:33,520
- Maggie--
- I feel myself suffocating from your support.

1216
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:35,055
You want truth or support?

1217
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:37,191
Did you think I didn't
know I fucked up?

1218
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:38,926
I've been saying it.

1219
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,996
I have $45,000 in student
loans to pay off,

1220
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,798
I spend three weeks'
take-home

1221
00:51:44,832 --> 00:51:47,133
on half a one-bedroom apartment
the size of a toolshed,

1222
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:50,169
and I'm sitting alone at a bar with
a drink that was made an hour ago.

1223
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:52,071
A good day is when I have
quarters for a dryer.

1224
00:51:52,105 --> 00:51:54,273
A bad day is when
I blow a newscast.

1225
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:57,576
That's my spectrum.

1226
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:00,979
Support is what
I wanted right then.

1227
00:52:01,013 --> 00:52:03,314
And I think you're rooting
for Will to fail.

1228
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:06,184
- You just said it would be in your best interest--
- Listen--

1229
00:52:06,218 --> 00:52:09,220
And I know he's not the
cuddliest guy in the world,

1230
00:52:09,255 --> 00:52:11,656
but he is trying to do good

1231
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:13,925
and he's risking a lot
to do it, and you and Reese--

1232
00:52:13,959 --> 00:52:16,927
Yeah, yeah.
Let's break up.

1233
00:52:16,962 --> 00:52:18,997
Don't-- no,
don't go like this.

1234
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:21,666
I'm s-- I'm sorry.
I said the wrong thing.

1235
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,469
Don...

1236
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,272
Oh, I'm on fire today.

1237
00:52:30,209 --> 00:52:33,077
- Evening, Mr. McAvoy.
- Good evening, Manny.

1238
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:36,514
We know how to live
with our neighbors here.

1239
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:38,716
- What's that?
- Your show tonight.

1240
00:52:38,751 --> 00:52:41,686
I--

1241
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,361
<i>( music playing )</i>

1243
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:23,324

1244
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,226
I really only drink
when I'm scared.

1245
00:53:25,261 --> 00:53:29,164
I would like to have a word with
you right here and right now.

1246
00:53:29,198 --> 00:53:32,134
( laughs )

1247
00:53:34,437 --> 00:53:36,038
Yes, ma'am.

1248
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:38,874
Don't "Yes, ma'am" me
with your sheepish charm.

1249
00:53:38,908 --> 00:53:41,076
Would you like to go
someplace private?

1250
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:42,745
I-- you covered for me.

1251
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:44,880
- Don't worry about it.
- I wasn't thanking you.

1252
00:53:44,914 --> 00:53:47,715
You and Don-- why do you
think I need protecting?

1253
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,151
You both like the fantasy
of a girl in distress?

1254
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,420
- How about I put you in a cab?
- I take the subway.

1255
00:53:52,454 --> 00:53:54,955
- Why do you think I need prot--
- I don't.

1256
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,891
But I cover for you,
Mac covers for me,

1257
00:53:56,925 --> 00:53:59,026
Will covers for everybody,
Charlie covers for Will.

1258
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:00,694
How come nobody's
yelling at me?

1259
00:54:00,729 --> 00:54:02,329
- You know how bad you screwed up, right?
- Yes.

1260
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,498
- Is there anyone who feels worse than you do?
- No.

1261
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:07,034
Then I doubt
it'll ever happen again.

1262
00:54:08,136 --> 00:54:09,637
Let me give you
money for a cab.

1263
00:54:09,671 --> 00:54:13,207
No, I have to go to Don's
apartment and apologize.

1264
00:54:13,241 --> 00:54:16,744
- For what?
- For suggesting he would--

1265
00:54:16,778 --> 00:54:19,714
you know, for asking--

1266
00:54:19,748 --> 00:54:21,316
I'll think of it on the way.

1267
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:24,386
We break up, I apologize,
everything's fine.

1268
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,288
Sounds like a super-healthy
relationship.

1269
00:54:26,322 --> 00:54:28,524
- I'd fight for it.
- I will fight for it.

1270
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,160
And I'll make it work
through sheer force of will,

1271
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:33,396
just like Mackenzie
will with Will

1272
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,698
and just like I made
the immigration segment work.

1273
00:54:35,732 --> 00:54:38,034
Will and Mackenzie
are going to kill each other

1274
00:54:38,068 --> 00:54:39,702
and the immigration segment
was a train wreck.

1275
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,404
You should shut up
more than you do.

1276
00:54:41,438 --> 00:54:43,439
Do people tell you that?

1277
00:54:43,474 --> 00:54:44,641
No.

1278
00:54:44,675 --> 00:54:46,810
You're being polite.

1279
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:52,749
I still don't know why
I'm being mean to you.

1280
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:56,086
Tess?
( snaps fingers )

1281
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,122
- Would you?
- Yeah.

1282
00:55:00,158 --> 00:55:01,625
Sorry.

1283
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,495
Hang on, all of you.

1284
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:07,164
I'm your senior producer.

1285
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,167
Fuck up again like this,
I'm gonna get mad.

1286
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:15,372
That's it.

1287
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,608
Take her to Don's place.

1288
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:26,751
- That was so awesome.
- Thank you.

1289
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:28,954
- Do a shot.
- No.

1290
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,526
( cell phone ringing )

1291
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,127
- Hello?
- <i>Neal, it's Will.</i>

1292
00:55:35,162 --> 00:55:38,531
- I hope you don't mind my calling so late.
- <i>No.</i>

1293
00:55:38,565 --> 00:55:41,301
I got your number from--
you know, there's a booklet.

1294
00:55:41,335 --> 00:55:43,203
- <i>The office directory.</i>
- Yeah.

1295
00:55:43,237 --> 00:55:44,671
The guy you found in Spokane,

1296
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:46,073
I want you to get
in touch with him

1297
00:55:46,107 --> 00:55:47,674
<i>and tell him that</i>
<i>you're gonna pay for a cab</i>

1298
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:49,109
to take him to and from work.

1299
00:55:49,144 --> 00:55:51,512
He should send you the receipts,
then give them to me.

1300
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,982
Will--

1301
00:55:54,016 --> 00:55:55,817
come on, let me post this
on your blog.

1302
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:57,386
- No.
- <i>Will--</i>

1303
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,222
- Keep my name out of it.
- Yes, sir.

1304
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:02,124
Is Mackenzie around there?

1305
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,759
Yeah.

1306
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:07,196
- Can you put her on the phone?
- Sure.

1307
00:56:12,937 --> 00:56:15,038
It's-- it's Will.

1308
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:23,647
I'm sorry...
about everything.

1309
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,882
<i>I'm just so sorry.</i>

1310
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:27,951

- I'm in.

1311
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:31,388
- What?
- I'm in. I'll see you on Monday.

1312
00:56:34,926 --> 00:56:37,762
- Are you still gonna worry about the ratings?
- Yes.

1313
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:40,731
- <i>Still gonna worry about being popular?</i>
- Yeah.

1314
00:56:40,765 --> 00:56:42,299
About being loved by strangers?

1315
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:45,136
Are you gonna keep asking me questions
that all mean the same thing?

1316
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,806
Till I get the right answer.

1317
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,741
I'm in.

1318
