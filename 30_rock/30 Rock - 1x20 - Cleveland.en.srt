1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,177
And this is the two-bedroom.

2
00:00:02,236 --> 00:00:04,446
Wow.

3
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:08,650
By the hammer of Thor!

4
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,153
Can you afford this place?

5
00:00:10,185 --> 00:00:11,185
Yeah.

6
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,900
I can
with this new promotion.

7
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:14,802
It's...a lot more money.

8
00:00:14,858 --> 00:00:17,563
Like "get away with murdering
my first wife" kind of dough.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,751
Mm-hmm.

10
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:21,567
See, now, I could hang
a huge TV right there.

11
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:23,805
You could get
that third humidifier

12
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,007
you always dreamed about.

13
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,068
Slow down.

14
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,116
I'm not ready
to move my humidifiers yet.

15
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,112
Oh, I know.
I don't mean right away.

16
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:32,819
I just meant...someday.
Hopefully.

17
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,022
Yeah, good.
Someday.

18
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,121
But for now,

19
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,818
I got a great job.

20
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:38,882
A kick-ass girlfriend.

21
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,774
I deserve an apartment
to match.

22
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,385
And I think this
is definitely it.

23
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,628
I'll take this one too.

24
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:47,629
My son Ahmed will keep
his motorcycles here.

25
00:00:48,835 --> 00:00:51,785
Oh! Thanks for coming.

26
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,290
Oh...ooh.

27
00:01:17,115 --> 00:01:18,078
Lemon!

28
00:01:18,116 --> 00:01:19,982
Oh, welcome back.
How was Paris?

29
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:21,981
Paris was fantastic.

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,926
We stayed in this little place
in the Seventh

31
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:25,278
that Phoebe knew about.

32
00:01:25,281 --> 00:01:26,687
I'm Phoebe.

33
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,487
We've met before.

34
00:01:28,529 --> 00:01:30,280
Jack proposed to me
outside your office.

35
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:32,286
I have hollow bones.
Like a bird.

36
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:34,132
Yes, no.
I remember you, hi.

37
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:35,094
Hi.

38
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:36,642
Well, I should go.

39
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,137
We've just won
the auction rights

40
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,400
to a fantastic collection
of Chinese erotica.

41
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,503
Pick out a good one for me.

42
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,847
Careful.

43
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,648
Bye.

44
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,301
So...have you guys
set a date?

45
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,912
Yes, we have.
May 18th.

46
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:55,616
That's Bianca's wedding date.
It was my idea.

47
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:57,056
That's fast.

48
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:58,657
Well, there are no rules
in love, Lemon.

49
00:01:58,663 --> 00:02:01,218
My...Princeton roommate
did it the right way.

50
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,161
Dated his college girlfriend
for 13 years,

51
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,817
and the marriage
didn't last eight months.

52
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,525
And now he's
a post-op transgender.

53
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,227
Will you look at that?

54
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:12,078
Phoebe reset my watch
to New York time

55
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,572
while I was sleeping
on the plane.

56
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:15,328
She really
is a wonderful girl.

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,580
And I do hope the two of you
get to know each other better.

58
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:18,677
Okay, sure.

59
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:20,038
Why don't you have
a girls' day out?

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,083
Take Jenna with you.

61
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,643
You could have lunch,
go shopping.

62
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:26,247
Here...take my gold card.

63
00:02:26,275 --> 00:02:27,593
Ooh, it's heavy.

64
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,449
It's...made of gold.

65
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,251
Ah. Wow.

66
00:02:32,282 --> 00:02:34,057
Turned me down, Liz Lemon.

67
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:35,255
Who?

68
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,455
The damn bank.

69
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:39,058
I need a loan to finance
my Thomas Jefferson movie.

70
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,851
It's gonna be
at least $30 million

71
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:42,763
with all the Claymation
sex scenes in it.

72
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,207
And they didn't want
to pay for that?

73
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:45,203
It's all right.

74
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:46,705
The movie's just
a small part of my plan.

75
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:49,363
What plan?
The Tracy Jordan comeback.

76
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,271
I'm doing a comedy tour,
a Michael McDonald cover album.

77
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,712
Ah, boy,
I don't know, Tray.

78
00:02:53,717 --> 00:02:56,021
I don't think of you
as a great multitasker.

79
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:58,717
What can I do?
I'm on my grind.

80
00:02:58,722 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm gonna have
so much money,

81
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,927
my grandkids
are gonna play lacrosse.

82
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:03,482
Lacrosse, Liz Lemon.

83
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:06,985
"I'm on my krind."
Is that a...

84
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,229
There he is.

85
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,387
The Floydster!

86
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:13,888
I heard you were going in
for your final interview.

87
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,096
I wanted to put in
a good word.

88
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,935
All right, well,
that should put me over the top.

89
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,141
Oh, you're already there.

90
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,937
The other candidate
is an outsider.

91
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,745
And we like to promote
from within.

92
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,399
Plus, his name
is Alan Garkel.

93
00:03:25,743 --> 00:03:28,398
You're never gonna lose a job
to a guy named Garkel.

94
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:31,154
Did someone say my name?

95
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:34,012
Nah, you're not
gonna beat that.

96
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,016
Well-played, Garkel.

97
00:03:42,465 --> 00:03:44,523
Because Carl's trying
to kill the gophers,

98
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,570
but then the explosion

99
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,356
knocks Danny's ball
into the hole,

100
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:48,358
and he wins the tournament.

101
00:03:48,418 --> 00:03:50,675
And that is the plot
ofCaddyshack.

102
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,234
I can't believe
you've never seen it.

103
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,776
Classic.

104
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:55,536
Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry.

105
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:57,185
Oh, you like Wagner?

106
00:03:57,236 --> 00:03:58,932
No, I like Elmer Fudd.

107
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,577
? Kill da wabbit ?

108
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,283
? Kill da wabbit ? ?

109
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:05,745
My parents
were both poets, so I...

110
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,190
don't really get it.

111
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:12,250
So this has just been
a whirlwind romance for you.

112
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,994
Just a...whirl of wind.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,502
Look, I know
what you must be thinking.

114
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:19,996
What kind of a woman
marries a man she hardly knows?

115
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,451
Whatisshe after?

116
00:04:21,455 --> 00:04:23,162
No, no, no.
I don't think that.

117
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:25,610
I completely get it,
why you would wanna marry Jack.

118
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:28,612
I'd marry Jack
in a heartbeat.

119
00:04:28,671 --> 00:04:30,961
I would have a three-way
with two Jacks.

120
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:32,372
You need to cool it.

121
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:33,817
Let's face it--
at our age,

122
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:35,469
we can't afford
to waste any time.

123
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:36,521
Mm-hmm.

124
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,178
Floyd and I have been
dating for a month.

125
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:41,080
Do you think I should be mad
that I don't have a ring?

126
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,628
Wow, howSex in the City
are we right now?

127
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,526
I'm Samantha,
you're Charlotte,

128
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,532
and you're the lady at home
who watches it.

129
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,983
Dude, check it out.

130
00:04:53,988 --> 00:04:56,094
Bill Cosby hates you.

131
00:04:56,135 --> 00:04:57,928
What?
Look here.

132
00:04:57,988 --> 00:04:59,837
"Tracy Jordan
has made a career

133
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:02,240
"out of exploiting
black stereotypes.

134
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,104
He is an embarrassment
to African-Americans."

135
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:06,500
Why would he say that?

136
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:09,609
What have I ever done
to embarrass black people?

137
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:10,609
Uh...

138
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:12,556
Why are we doing this?

139
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,754
Because the Jets lost!

140
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,660
Mr. Jordan,
your manager called.

141
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:19,257
Temple University has canceled
your stand-up appearance.

142
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:21,119
And Michael McDonald
is denying permission

143
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,365
to record any of his songs.

144
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:23,722
In other words:

145
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,623
? Oh, Tracy, you can't ?

146
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:28,066
? Use any of my songs ? ?

147
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:31,731
This is no coincidence.

148
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,963
What are you talking about?

149
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:34,275
The bank loan.

150
00:05:34,278 --> 00:05:36,335
The Michael McDonald
situation.

151
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:37,635
Temple University.

152
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,578
Dr. Cosby
is sending a message!

153
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,180
They're out to destroy me!

154
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,942
Who is?

155
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,088
The Black Crusaders.

156
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,898
Oh, Floyd
would love this one.

157
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,700
Yikes!

158
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,359
If I was gonna spend $600
to have my boobs pinched,

159
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,703
I would have gone
to that fundraiser

160
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,053
at the Clintons' house.

161
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:06,365
Come on, that was solid!

162
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:09,499
Liz, I'm concerned
I'm boring Jack sexually.

163
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,913
No, no.
No...ugh.

164
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:12,115
We've only
just got engaged,

165
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,503
and already our intercourse
is infrequent

166
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:14,717
and unimaginative.

167
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,320
Phoebe, I'm really not
that kind of girlfriend.

168
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:17,822
I would gladly pick you up
at the airport.

169
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,319
In Paris, he fell asleep
on top of me.

170
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,629
I mean, I just want
to make him happy.

171
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,323
If he's happy,
I'm happy, you know?

172
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,232
Mm.

173
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,687
Do you have
that credit card?

174
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:31,022
Thanks.

175
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,932
Hi, I'll take everything.

176
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:35,738
Liz, can you help me?

177
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:36,896
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:39,236
I don't know you,
but I will help you.

179
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,345
Damn it.
I can't believe it.

180
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,002
Garkel?
I'm sorry.

181
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:44,201
I'm just sick of it.

182
00:06:44,242 --> 00:06:45,643
I'm so tired of this city.

183
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:47,808
I am so tired
of the rat race.

184
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,512
Fellas!

185
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:53,357
You gotta keep it down,
okay?

186
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,858
I got work in the morning.

187
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:56,916
Molnya is looking
very strong tonight.

188
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:59,613
Mr. Debarber, come on.

189
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,366
Fine.
20 across the board.

190
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,823
Yeah, you gotta
talk to your landlord

191
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,024
about that rat race.

192
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,371
That is my landlord.

193
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,873
Oh.
Yeah.

194
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:10,768
Maybe I just need
to go out of town

195
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:11,870
for a little while.

196
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,776
That's a good idea.
Vermont is always nice.

197
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,625
Or the Bahamas.

198
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,977
I was thinking of Cleveland.

199
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,676
That is also a place.

200
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:21,279
I just haven't been home
in a long time.

201
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:22,882
We need
to search your bag.

202
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,687
Ugh.
Of course they do.

203
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:28,078
You know, I dream
about moving back to Lakewood.

204
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,491
Or maybe even
Shaker Heights.

205
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:32,250
Big Creek Parkway.

206
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,393
Sending the kids
to St. John Bosco's, you know.

207
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,056
Maybe even cheering on
the tribe at the Jake.

208
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,005
This dream, this
is way down the road, right?

209
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,362
Yeah. Yeah.

210
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,094
Three, maybe four years.

211
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:46,306
What's
this fungus cream for?

212
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,097
All right, that's it.
Show's over.

213
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:49,659
Gimme that.

214
00:07:49,663 --> 00:07:52,161
Let's just walk.

215
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,475
So how long do you see yourself
living in New York?

216
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,320
Well, like, forever.
At least, I did.

217
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,215
Really?

218
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,980
You wanna end up
like that?

219
00:08:02,672 --> 00:08:04,722
No.
I'm gonna be like her.

220
00:08:04,727 --> 00:08:08,591
Oh, there is nothing
like New York in the spring!

221
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,180
It's--oh!

222
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,935
Ooh.
Ooh.

223
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,189
All right, come on.

224
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,188
This is the capital
of the world.

225
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:16,125
The culture, the div--

226
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,435
Ugh!

227
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,941
Uck!
You all right?

228
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,243
He spit in my mouth!

229
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:23,004
Ugh!

230
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,694
Let's go to Cleveland.

231
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,850
Oh, blurgh!

232
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:31,721
Hey, Frank told me
about that Cosby thing.

233
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:32,785
That is harsh.

234
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,092
Harsh?
I'm done.

235
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,494
The Black Crusaders want
to make an example out of me.

236
00:08:36,535 --> 00:08:38,543
I'm not gonna ask you
who that is.

237
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:40,793
The Black Crusaders
are a secret group

238
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,101
of powerful black Americans.

239
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:44,841
Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey
are the chief majors.

240
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,645
But Jesse Jackson,
Colin Powell,

241
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,445
and Gordon fromSesame Street,
they're members too.

242
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:50,947
And they meet
four times a year

243
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:52,801
in the skull
of the Statue of Liberty.

244
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:54,852
You can read about that
on the interweb.

245
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:57,815
Ah, well, it must be true
if it's on the "interweb."

246
00:08:57,854 --> 00:08:58,810
Right, uh-huh.

247
00:08:58,854 --> 00:09:01,020
Make fun of me
all you want, Liz Lemon.

248
00:09:01,058 --> 00:09:03,316
Do you know they'll
ruin anybody who they think

249
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,061
are making black people
look bad?

250
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,371
They tanked
50 Cent's movie.

251
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,726
The blew out
Terrell Owens' ankle.

252
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,568
And they canceled
Eddie Murphy's Oscar,

253
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,477
'cause he, uh, ran out
on Scary Spice.

254
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,680
And now they after
Tracy Jordan!

255
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,235
Tracy, I know the movie
is important to you,

256
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,581
and you're stressed out
and everything,

257
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,884
but keep it together, okay?

258
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:23,986
The cleanup continues.

259
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,774
Fortunately,
there were no injuries.

260
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,942
Tracy Jordan,

261
00:09:26,982 --> 00:09:29,337
the Black Crusaders
are coming for you.

262
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,777
We'll have more on the weather
coming up...

263
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,194
Man, I wish somebody else
had seen that.

264
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,392
Hi.

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,159
Look what Phoebe got me.

266
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,702
Golf clubs?

267
00:09:41,158 --> 00:09:42,350
Not just golf clubs.

268
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:44,205
These clubs
once belonged

269
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:46,106
to President Gerald Ford.

270
00:09:46,163 --> 00:09:48,064
Oh, wow.

271
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:50,799
So what do you think
of Phoebe?

272
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:53,362
Oh, well...
we had fun.

273
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:56,117
And, uh, Phoebe bought
some bonkers underwear.

274
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:57,870
So have fun
with that tonight.

275
00:09:57,913 --> 00:09:59,120
Well, not tonight.

276
00:09:59,177 --> 00:10:00,519
Uh, may I?
Oh.

277
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:01,519
Thank you.

278
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,979
Not tonight
unfortunately.

279
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,782
She's, uh, speaking
in a seminar

280
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:07,028
up at Columbia.

281
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:10,025
And as much as I would
like to attend,

282
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,381
I haven't been above
72nd Street in over a decade.

283
00:10:13,384 --> 00:10:15,824
Well, I'm glad
you're happy.

284
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,193
Ha!

285
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,827
It's all Phoebe.

286
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:23,799
We have an attraction that can
only be described as...

287
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,393
wolf-like.

288
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:26,395
Lupine.

289
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,836
Okay.

290
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:29,105
I am so exhausted.

291
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,450
Paris was,
to borrow a phrase,

292
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,556
just...bonkers.

293
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:34,905
Yes, Phoebe said.

294
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,630
Do you cover him?

295
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:50,828
Psst! Psst!

296
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,330
Phoebe isn't going
to Columbia tonight.

297
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,571
She had me call a car

298
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,274
to take her
to this address downtown.

299
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,176
So what do you want me to do,
go spy on her?

300
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,682
For Mr. Donaghy's sake.

301
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:02,429
I know you have
your doubts about this.

302
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:03,484
I can see it in your eyes.

303
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:05,181
It's weird, right?

304
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:06,682
Then again,
all relationships are weird.

305
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:08,645
I mean, my boyfriend Floyd
wants to go to Cleveland.

306
00:11:08,684 --> 00:11:10,795
Ah, thank God.

307
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,494
Mr. Donaghy's office.

308
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,555
Just a quick look.

309
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:26,459
By the hammer of Thor!

310
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,113
Ew.

311
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,627
Jack, I have
to talk to you.

312
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:51,985
Is this about the Tracy situation? No.

313
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:54,135
Then it'll have to wait.
What Tracy situation?

314
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,425
I tried to call you.

315
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:57,926
He set fire to a cardboard
cutout of Al Roker,

316
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,796
and now he's locked himself
in his dressing room.

317
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:00,896
Oh, brother.

318
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,642
Tracy!

319
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,496
Come out.
Nobody is trying to get you.

320
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,145
Have you seen the cover
of this month'sOprahmagazine?

321
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,408
It's an anagram for
"Outlaw Sour Tray."

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,213
Who taught Tracy
about anagrams?

323
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,061
I'm gonna call
Dr. Spaceman.

324
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,010
Hey, car's downstairs.
You ready to go?

325
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:22,258
Um...

326
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,320
The Black Crusaders
are trying to get rid of me.

327
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,515
They want me to disappear
like Coolio.

328
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,865
Coolio is around!

329
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:28,872
What--

330
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:31,228
Would you also prescribe
something for Tracy

331
00:12:31,268 --> 00:12:33,172
which would keep him awake
during sex?

332
00:12:33,229 --> 00:12:35,433
Oh, great.
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

333
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,873
Thanks.

334
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:40,078
Let's get outta here.

335
00:12:40,081 --> 00:12:42,840
? What hot spot's got
the hippest groove? ?

336
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,180
Welcome to Cleveland.
Good morning.

337
00:12:44,185 --> 00:12:46,643
? Where all the real
gone daddies move ?

338
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,685
Good morning.
Hi.

339
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:50,187
Hello.

340
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,544
What smells so good?

341
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,296
Cleveland.

342
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:58,052
? Where the jet set swing
with hepcats ?

343
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:00,898
? Shop at Higby's,
then we'll hit the Flats ?

344
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:02,298
Excuse me.

345
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,404
Are you a model?

346
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,606
No.

347
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,054
Oh, you are so skinny.

348
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:07,603
You really should
eat something.

349
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,715
? I say, Cleveland, hello ?

350
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:14,717
? Yeah ?

351
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,975
? New York and Paris
just don't have ?

352
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,922
? The sights you see
and you can have ?

353
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:20,917
Excuse me, ma'am.

354
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,718
Ugh.

355
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:24,420
Would you like to pet
a real police horse?

356
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:26,985
? Chef Boyardee
was born here ?

357
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,076
Yes!

358
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:32,433
? Come on, cool cats,
and play your skins ?

359
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,736
? In Lyndhurst
and the Burg of Twins ?

360
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:36,837
Oh, ladies first.

361
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:39,027
? I say Cleveland, hello ?

362
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:41,142
Hi, I'll have two hotdogs,

363
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,594
a pretzel with
extra melted cheese...

364
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,444
Hiya.

365
00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:47,943
Ms. Lemon,
this is Kenneth,

366
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:49,713
the NBC page
in New York City.

367
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:50,819
I hate to bother you
out west,

368
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,475
but Tracy Jordan
hasn't come to work.

369
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,918
Kenneth, don't be
so New York uptight.

370
00:13:54,924 --> 00:13:56,419
I'm sure he'll show up.

371
00:13:56,422 --> 00:13:59,424
? Look over there,
I think I see a movie star ?

372
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:01,583
? Even movie stars,
they come to Cleveland ?

373
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:02,788
? To get away ?

374
00:14:02,827 --> 00:14:05,021
? Tracy Jordan,
you've gotta get away ?

375
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:07,587
? Gotta get away,
gotta get away ?

376
00:14:07,636 --> 00:14:11,589
? To Cleveland ? ?

377
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,802
Liz...

378
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,943
I have something important
I wanna talk to you about.

379
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,598
The top law firm
in Cleveland wants me.

380
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:22,010
And...I think
I should accept.

381
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:23,150
What? Really?

382
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:25,917
What's this?

383
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:27,015
It's a house
in the Heights

384
00:14:27,047 --> 00:14:28,319
that I can afford.

385
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,461
When did you have time
to look for jobs and houses?

386
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,325
When you were at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

387
00:14:33,363 --> 00:14:35,726
Did I tell you
I sat in ZZ Top's car?

388
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:37,428
And then I had lunch
with Little Richard.

389
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,564
And, I know
it's not TGS, but...

390
00:14:40,624 --> 00:14:43,674
I'm sure you can find a job
at one of the local TV stations.

391
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,676
You sureould.

392
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,684
We need a host
for a new cooking show

393
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,443
on WKYC.

394
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:52,485
Uh...

395
00:15:01,302 --> 00:15:02,898
Where have you been?

396
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,306
Cleveland.

397
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,460
For God sakes, Lemon,

398
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,763
we'd all like
to flee to the Cleve.

399
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,011
And club up
down at the Flats

400
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,367
and have lunch
with Little Richard.

401
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:11,714
But we fight those urges

402
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,814
because we have
responsibilities.

403
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:14,813
What's going on?

404
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:16,374
Tracy.
He's missing.

405
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:17,414
What?

406
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,723
No. Kenneth, have you
tried to call Tracy?

407
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:21,110
Yes, ma'am, I tried
all six of his cell phones.

408
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,884
It's almost as if
he never existed.

409
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,387
Or maybe he's not answering.

410
00:15:28,487 --> 00:15:30,930
Lemon, TGS
without Tracy Jordan

411
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,238
is basically a puppet show.

412
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,839
You know,
I'm right here.

413
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,335
Oh, why am I doing this

414
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,737
when I could be happy
living in Cleveland?

415
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:38,739
What?

416
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,343
Floyd and I
are thinking of moving.

417
00:15:40,348 --> 00:15:41,348
No, you're not.
No, you're not.

418
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:42,950
Look, every great getaway

419
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,547
has that moment when you want
to pack it all in and stay.

420
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:47,749
That's how I ended up
with a timeshare...

421
00:15:47,753 --> 00:15:49,258
in Port Arthur, Texas.

422
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,553
I don't think
that's what this is.

423
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:51,646
I mean, Floyd
is pretty great.

424
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:54,358
And, look, in Cleveland,
I'm a model.

425
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,654
Yeah, we're all models
west of the Allegheny.

426
00:15:58,714 --> 00:16:00,872
I'm serious about this.

427
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,222
Maybe you should go.

428
00:16:02,266 --> 00:16:04,376
I mean, your head is obviously
not in the game lately.

429
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,576
And now
you've lost Tracy.

430
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:06,663
Maybe you're burned out.

431
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:07,936
What is this?

432
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:09,775
This is Frank's
"Hot Baby" sketch,

433
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,137
which is regrettable,

434
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:13,285
but we have no Tracy Jordan
and a show in two days.

435
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,735
But, hey,

436
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,944
that's not gonna be
your problem

437
00:16:15,982 --> 00:16:18,091
once you move to Ohio.

438
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,294
No, you're not.

439
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,055
Frank, that's
gonna get cut.

440
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:27,251
Blurgh!

441
00:16:27,297 --> 00:16:28,688
Did you say
anything to Jack?

442
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,254
No, but I'm going to
if you don't.

443
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:31,506
Oh, grow up, Liz.

444
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,007
I didn't tell Jack
where I was going

445
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:35,408
'cause I didn't want him
to get upset about nothing.

446
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:36,811
That man was a former
lover of mine.

447
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:38,515
I was ending it with him,
forever.

448
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:40,411
Uh-huh, and are all
your ex-boyfriends

449
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,875
rich, older gentlemen?

450
00:16:41,914 --> 00:16:43,420
I care about Jack.

451
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:45,822
I make him a better man.

452
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:46,980
You know how John Lennon

453
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,325
was better than
the rest of the Beatles,

454
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,483
but didn't realize it
until he met Yoko Ono?

455
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:51,831
Well, I'm Jack's Yoko.

456
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,327
Youwantto be Yoko?

457
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:54,827
This is none of your business,
anyway.

458
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:56,089
I'm marrying Jack.

459
00:16:56,129 --> 00:16:58,339
He's everything I ever
wanted. Oh, I bet he is.

460
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,642
You don't know anything
about me, so back off!

461
00:17:02,098 --> 00:17:04,343
What happened
to your accent?

462
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,042
Um...

463
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,548
I don't know what
you're on about.

464
00:17:07,603 --> 00:17:10,653
You...daft wanker.

465
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,023
Hello?

466
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:24,167
Hello, Liz Lemon.

467
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,564
It's me.

468
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,973
Stacy Gordon.

469
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:29,675
Tracy, where are you
calling from?

470
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,077
I can't tell you that.

471
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:33,329
I'm sorry, Liz Lemon.

472
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:35,327
I wanna thank you
for everything you've done.

473
00:17:35,331 --> 00:17:36,439
But I quit.

474
00:17:36,478 --> 00:17:38,085
For God's sakes, Tracy,
where are you?

475
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,683
Starting a new life.

476
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,386
Because
of the Black Crusaders?

477
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:42,589
That's crazy.

478
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:44,446
Tray?

479
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:45,887
Damn it, Lemon,
why didn't you tell me

480
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:47,490
the Black Crusaders
were after Tracy?

481
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:53,658
Surprisingly fast.

482
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:54,897
Oh.

483
00:18:03,364 --> 00:18:04,798
I'm on it.

484
00:18:08,513 --> 00:18:10,913
I can't go to Cleveland.

485
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:12,476
Hi.

486
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:14,122
Hi. I'm sorry.

487
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,518
I just, I've been thinking
about this.

488
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:16,871
And I think you're great.

489
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:19,022
And obviously Cleveland
is great.

490
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,485
But I can't move.

491
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,489
I know.

492
00:18:22,526 --> 00:18:23,987
My life is here.
My friends are here.

493
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:26,380
The sh is here.
And I've known you a month.

494
00:18:26,383 --> 00:18:29,533
Oh, you hate me right
now, don't you? No.

495
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:31,825
No, it was a crazy idea
to begin with.

496
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,738
We were on a vacation high--

497
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:34,798
Exactly.
It's like a drug.

498
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:36,942
Right--
if the whole world

499
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,540
moved to their favorite
vacation spots,

500
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,399
then the whole world
would live in Hawaii

501
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:41,650
and Italy and Cleveland.

502
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,750
Totally, I mean...

503
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:44,747
But just knowing
that C-Town is out there

504
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:46,340
as an option for the future--
Liz...

505
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,758
it's gonna make it so
much easier-- Liz...

506
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,452
I took that job.

507
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:53,955
Blurgh.

508
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,825
Did you locate Tracy?

509
00:19:00,855 --> 00:19:02,225
Ugh, not yet.

510
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:03,466
I'm working on it.

511
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,028
You know, you never answered
my question the other day.

512
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,230
What do you think of Phoebe?

513
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,030
Honestly, I wish
I had the guts

514
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,276
to do what you're doing.

515
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,973
Just...going for it.

516
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:12,682
God bless.

517
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,185
You still haven't answered
my question.

518
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,285
I...think she
likes you a lot.

519
00:19:18,341 --> 00:19:21,488
And I think
she takes care of you.

520
00:19:21,545 --> 00:19:23,443
And she's smart
and pretty.

521
00:19:23,489 --> 00:19:25,648
And completely wrong.

522
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,691
And she doesn't
deserve you.

523
00:19:27,697 --> 00:19:29,196
I think she's weird,

524
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,499
and I don't like her,

525
00:19:30,555 --> 00:19:32,449
and her ex-boyfriend
is old.

526
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:34,496
And I don't even think
she's British!

527
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:36,198
And you
shouldn't marry her, Jack.

528
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:38,206
Please don't marry her!

529
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:42,961
Oh, my God.

530
00:19:43,005 --> 00:19:44,464
Lemon, Phoebe was right.

531
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:46,510
You are infatuated with me.

532
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:47,515
What?

533
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:48,515
No! No, no, no.

534
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:50,620
Lemon, you
are a wonderful woman.

535
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:52,620
And you deserve to be
as happy as I am.

536
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:54,516
Maybe with Floyd, right?

537
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:55,717
No, don't mention Floyd.

538
00:19:55,722 --> 00:19:58,020
Floyd is not happening.
Floyd is moving.

539
00:19:58,025 --> 00:20:00,021
Floyd is moving?

540
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:01,030
What did you do?

541
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:02,229
What didIdo?

542
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,025
I acted like
a rational adult!

543
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:06,533
I didn't get engaged
to some gold digger,

544
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,135
and then delude myself
into thinking

545
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,237
that I could
keep up with her.

546
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,694
Yeah, Jack, I know
that you fell asleep

547
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,486
on top of her in Paris.

548
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:16,098
In Paris, France.

549
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:22,246
I think you should go.

550
00:20:32,858 --> 00:20:36,359
Uh, Phoebe, darling,
Lemon was just leaving.

551
00:20:51,677 --> 00:20:53,675
Blurgh.



9999
