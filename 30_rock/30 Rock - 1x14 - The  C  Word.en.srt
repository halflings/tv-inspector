2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:05,714
Come on in, Tracy.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:07,716
Yo, is this about that little
red-headed intern?

4
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,218
'Cause she asked me to take it out.

5
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,385
No, no, no.

6
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,887
I wanted to invite you to join me

7
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:14,681
at a charity golf tourney
that Don Geiss is hosting

8
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,308
at his country club in Old Saybrook.

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,186
I'm not familiar with about
half the words in that sentence.

10
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:24,690
How 'bout you come with me to a big party
in Connecticut, and meet Don Geiss?

11
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:26,810
Is that the gay guy from Project Runway?

12
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:27,695
 No.

13
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,984
He's the CEO of this corporation.

14
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:30,783
The big man.

15
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:31,902
The dude from my checks?

16
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:33,990
The dude from your checks.

17
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,610
And a good person for you to know.

18
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,623
A'ight, sure.

19
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,490
Thanks for inviting me.

20
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,411
 Okay false alarm.

21
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:43,581
It turns out she asked him to take it out.

22
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:45,290
Oh, hey.

23
00:00:45,506 --> 00:00:49,213
I'll see you in CT, Jackie D.

24
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:50,092
What's that about?

25
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:53,302
I've invited him to join me at
a GE charity golf tournament in Connecticut.

26
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,182
Was Courtney Love not available?

27
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:58,013
Liz, all the VPs will be angling
to golf with Don Geiss,

28
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:01,012
but my partner will be Tracy Jordan,
his grandchildren's favorite movie star.

29
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:03,103
Geiss will absolutely choose us,
and that's a big deal

30
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:06,902
because being in a foursome
with this man can change your life.

31
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:08,483
You might want to rephrase that.

32
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,482
Golf with Geiss means four hours of face time

33
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,400
with a man you normally
only get 20 minutes with.

34
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:14,192
Which one is Geiss again, the bald one?

35
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,901
No.

36
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:17,490
That one.

37
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,281
Where did that come from?

38
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,990
I painted it myself.

39
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,912
Wow, that's really good.

40
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,002
You want one?

41
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:27,000
Consider it done.

42
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,590
Thanks.

43
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,882
Simply the best

44
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,110
Has anybody seen Condoleeza
on Meet the Press yesterday?

45
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,202
She always sounds so terrified.

46
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:01,202
She's always, like,

47
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,290
The President has a plan for Iran,

48
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:08,002
and we are currently adhering to that plan.

49
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:09,291
Hey, Frank, wake up.

50
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,083
You're not allowed to sleep
through the topical meeting.

51
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,212
Dude, I'm exhausted.

52
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:15,212
I stayed up all night watching
a Designing Women marathon.

53
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:15,881
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:16,721
Oh, yeah, me too.

55
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,012
At first, I hated it.

56
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,090
And then I liked it.

57
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,011
And then I hated it again.

58
00:02:21,186 --> 00:02:23,600
And then I got horny,
and then I fell asleep.

59
00:02:23,817 --> 00:02:27,390
Well, focus up, we have
a lot of work to do.

60
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,892
Lutz, not while we're working!

61
00:02:29,106 --> 00:02:30,982
Ay, pero ay Dios mio!

62
00:02:31,195 --> 00:02:32,692
Oh, I'm sorry Theresa.

63
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:35,480
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:38,782
Okay, maybe something about
the mid-term elections?

65
00:02:38,998 --> 00:02:41,492
Hey, what about my Dancing
with the Hobo sketch?

66
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:44,913
I didn't like it two weeks ago
when it was called America's Next Top Hobo,

67
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,713
and I didn't like it a month ago,
when it was called Hobo Eye for the Straight Guy.

68
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,082
Deal or No Hobo?

69
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,793
Hey, Lutz, why don't you approach your job
with the same creativity

70
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,091
and excitement you have for
all-you-can-eat buffets?

71
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,800
Ooh. Ooh.

72
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,510
Okay, the van to take you up
to Connecticut will be leaving at noon.

73
00:03:01,686 --> 00:03:04,603
And once you get up to the golf course,
you'll be working in pairs.

74
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:10,101
So, Tim and Shyla, Amy and Becca,
Kenneth and Grace, and Eric and Pat.

75
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,111
Okay, have fun.
Don't get drunk.

76
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:14,402
Buddy up.

77
00:03:14,616 --> 00:03:15,403
Mr. Hornberger.

78
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:16,403
Yeah?

79
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:17,990
Grace and I cannot work together.

80
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,191
Why not?

81
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,283
We have a past.
A romantic past.

82
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:28,200
Well, Grace, it's been
a pleasure talking to you.

83
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,710
Grace Park!

84
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,582
You know this can't happen.

85
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,082
We're pages.

86
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,382
I just don't want to
disgrace the peacock.

87
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:40,883
Oh, Kenneth, if you're worried about disgracing
the National Broadcasting Company,

88
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,092
you're too late.

89
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,991
Look, Grace, this is obviously
incredibly awkward for both of us,

90
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:07,080
but let's just try to be professional.

91
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,580
Your peacock earrings look nice.

92
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,582
Doggone it, Grace,

93
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:14,881
I just don't know myself around you.

94
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:15,883
Hello, gentlemen.

95
00:04:16,086 --> 00:04:18,592
Welcome to the ninth annual
Cure Diabetes Now golf tournament.

96
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:19,883
Has Don Geiss arrived yet?

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,302
No, sir, but if you'd like,
we could work out a signal,

98
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:23,800
so I could let you know
when he does arrive.

99
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,093
Like--

100
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,181
That won't be necessary.

101
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:30,810
I'll probably just do it anyway.

102
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,892
That cold open you guys wrote last night
came out really good.

103
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:34,103
Oh, thanks.

104
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:35,402
It was like pulling teeth.

105
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,193
They're so lazy sometimes.

106
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:38,193
Especially Lutz.

107
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:39,982
Well, good job whipping 'em into shape.

108
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,401
That thing is really smart.

109
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,401
Now, when Dennis Hastert farts,
should that be live, or pre-recorded?

110
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:43,903
Live.

111
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,280
It has to be live for the timing.

112
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:48,413
I thought so too.

113
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:49,993
Look at these guys.

114
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,290
Yeah.

115
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,792
They like you.

116
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,580
They're very good at sensing
debilitating loneliness in a person.

117
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,381
Maybe you ought to adopt one.

118
00:04:57,587 --> 00:04:58,293
Oh, I can't.

119
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,593
I'm allergic to anything
warm and adorable.

120
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:02,013
I'm sick of it.

121
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:05,590
I'm doing my job, and she just shoots me down
in front of everybody.

122
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,801
I don't care if she's the boss,
Liz is a grade-A--

123
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:09,890
Runt!

124
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,012
What?

125
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,481
This kitten, he's such a runt!

126
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:15,600
I'm gonna name you Runty.

127
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,690
You're such a little raging little runt!

128
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:19,691
Come on, Runty.

129
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:22,401
Come on.

130
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,110
Jack, how are you?

131
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:26,780
Ted, Amanda, so nice to see you.

132
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:27,613
Hello.

133
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,912
This is Tracy Jordan.

134
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,492
Ted here is the head of our
commercial aviation division.

135
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,291
You need to hook me up
with one of them helicopters.

136
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:34,082
Absolutely.

137
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:35,713
I'd be happy to arrange
for you to take a ride.

138
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,290
No, I don't want to get in it.

139
00:05:37,507 --> 00:05:42,880
I want to blow it up and run away
from it in slow motion.

140
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,381
Pleasure to have met you.

141
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:45,510
Damn straight.

142
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,892
I'm delightful.

143
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,600
You're doing great.
Everybody loves you.

144
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:54,890
On season five, when Delta
was really packin' it on---

145
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,985
Glorious.

146
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,394
We need to fire Lutz.

147
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:58,312
Why, what happened?

148
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,611
He called me the worst name ever.

149
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:01,693
What did he call you?

150
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,482
I'm not gonna repeat it.
That's how much I hate it.

151
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,113
Fat can?

152
00:06:04,286 --> 00:06:04,613
No.

153
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:05,192
Mouth hooker?

154
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:05,693
No.

155
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,200
Monster bitch.

156
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:06,783
Hatchet face.

157
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:08,201
No!

158
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:11,911
The one the rhymes with the name
of your favorite Todd Rundgren album.

159
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,492
It rhymes with Hermit of Mink Hollow?

160
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,081
No!

161
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:17,003
Oh.

162
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:17,921
Oh boy.

163
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,503
Well, you know, he was probably
just blowing off steam.

164
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:21,790
You can't fire a guy for cursing.

165
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,591
I'm not upset about cursing.
I mean, I love cursing.

166
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:26,590
I love it.

167
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:31,181
But this word is not acceptable
because there's nothing
you can call a guy back.

168
00:06:31,396 --> 00:06:33,600
There is no male equivalent to this word.

169
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,482
Well, why don't we come up with one
and then you can call him that?

170
00:06:36,685 --> 00:06:38,893
Like...monkus.

171
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:39,980
Fungdark.

172
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,902
No, I'm serious, you guys.

173
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,110
You're just in reaction right now.

174
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:45,280
You need to just take
a few hours and calm down.

175
00:06:45,486 --> 00:06:47,693
Don't tell me to calm down you fungdark.

176
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,201
Yeah, you're right.

177
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:49,782
It doesn't work.

178
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:52,123
I don't know, I think
Liz is right about this.

179
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,411
Lutz has been totally slacking off
since his grandma died.

180
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:56,203
What?

181
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:57,413
Why didn't you guys tell me?

182
00:06:57,587 --> 00:06:59,583
I thought you knew
and you were just being a...

183
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:02,381
You know, that word Lutz called you.

184
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,713
Wait, are you saying that
I am like that sometimes?

185
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:05,501
Um...

186
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,302
Um...

187
00:07:06,517 --> 00:07:09,513
And they thought my sister
couldn't even have a baby,
so she's really excited.

188
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:11,802
Oh, he's adorable.

189
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:16,311
Okay, we're at the bottom of page two.

190
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:24,822
Hey, look everybody Sherlock Homo is here
to solve the case of the gay sweater.

191
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:30,782
I'm telling you guys...

192
00:07:30,998 --> 00:07:36,410
watching that isn't gonna
get us out of here any faster.

193
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,083
Oh, my God, I am.

194
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:40,082
I'm a total...

195
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:41,210
Runt!

196
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,002
Runt!

197
00:07:43,215 --> 00:07:44,500
I lost my kitten.

198
00:07:44,718 --> 00:07:46,091
Has anyone seen my runt?

199
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:47,303
Runt!

200
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:49,093
Runt!

201
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,590
Bringing Tracy Jordan was a smart move, Jack.

202
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,680
He's the hit of the party.

203
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,300
You got that right, my friend.

204
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,812
Tomorrow I'm gonna be in an intense
six hour foursome with three other men.

205
00:07:58,025 --> 00:08:01,102
And one of them will be Don Geiss
and he's gonna get all of my attention.

206
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:05,810
And you're just gonna sit back and watch.

207
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:10,992
Would you excuse me?

208
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,700
You know the army's been messing with the sun.

209
00:08:12,915 --> 00:08:14,493
That's why I keep my junk covered.

210
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,700
Once that stuff get in your hang,
you're done.

211
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,410
Would you excuse us for a moment, please?

212
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:19,203
What's going on?

213
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:20,913
It's game time.

214
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,713
Jack, you handsome son of a gun!

215
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,791
This guy gets younger every time I see him!

216
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,000
No, you're the one.

217
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,502
Oh, hair like a Viking.

218
00:08:27,718 --> 00:08:28,711
God bless you.

219
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,880
Don, I want you to meet
my friend Tracy Jordan.

220
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,380
Tracy Jordan.

221
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:33,683
This is exciting.

222
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,513
My grandchildren just love your movies.

223
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:40,023
Thank you so much for being here
and supporting diabetes research.

224
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,101
Hey, I feel you.

225
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:43,893
Messed up sugar runs in my family too.

226
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,690
So, how's your short game?

227
00:08:46,907 --> 00:08:47,810
You'll find out tomorrow.

228
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:52,402
This guys spends so much time in the sand
that his nickname should be Falu-ser.

229
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,283
That's humorous.

230
00:08:54,498 --> 00:08:56,622
Hey, how come you don't hire
more black people around here?

231
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,782
Beg your pardon?

232
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,792
How come there's no black people here?

233
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,792
Black people can't make light bulbs?

234
00:09:02,006 --> 00:09:05,922
No, actually we have
an award winning diversity program.

235
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,710
How come there's just me
and Carlton over there?

236
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,380
I believe Tracy's referring to Carlton,
the straight laced brother

237
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:18,180
from Fresh Prince of Bel Air,
1990 through 1996. On NBC.

238
00:09:18,398 --> 00:09:21,012
Are we having fun or what?

239
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,982
My associate's name is Francis Callier.

240
00:09:24,187 --> 00:09:25,983
And he's a lawyer.

241
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:28,812
Excuse me.

242
00:09:39,418 --> 00:09:43,413
So what time does this
golf thing kick off tomorrow?

243
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,582
It doesn't matter now, Tracy.

244
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:46,921
We're not in Geiss' foursome,
thanks to you.

245
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,213
What?

246
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:49,380
I can't help it if he got mad.

247
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:50,383
You know me.

248
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:52,002
I'm gonna say what's on my mind, Jack.

249
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,301
No, not in here you don't.

250
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:57,092
I wanted you to entertain these people,
not publicly humiliate them.

251
00:09:57,308 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm supposed to just be a funny black man
who says funny things.

252
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,180
No, I wanted you to discuss your
astounding medical breakthroughs.

253
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:03,813
Okay.

254
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:07,692
Bartender, could you bring me a Mustang Melon
and a bag of barbeque potato chips?

255
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,483
'Cause apparently I'm only here
to be a stereotype.

256
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:11,401
Would you keep your voice down, please?

257
00:10:11,616 --> 00:10:12,403
You're embarrassing yourself.

258
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:14,991
No, I'm not embarrassing myself,
I'm embarrassing you.

259
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:19,992
And guess what, Jack?
I'm just getting started.

260
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:26,583
Son, I wasn't joking
about those chips.

261
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:27,790
Hey hey hey.

262
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:30,502
What do you wanna do about Lutz?
Should I call him into my office?

263
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:32,091
I think we should wait on that.

264
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:33,503
Really? Okay.

265
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:34,383
Whatcha got?

266
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,301
A-ha!

267
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:37,221
I made something for the writers.

268
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,592
Brisket!

269
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:42,010
No, it's two dozen cupcakes
with melted mini-candy bars in the middle.

270
00:10:42,187 --> 00:10:42,511
Mmm.

271
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,603
Oh, I get it.

272
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:46,101
You're trying to be nice now
'cause of what Lutz said.

273
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:47,890
No, I'm not trying to be nice.

274
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,391
I am nice.

275
00:10:49,606 --> 00:10:52,902
I'm a nice person
you bald, gangly...

276
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:57,993
I'm gonna try harder.
I'm gonna try and be nice.

277
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:07,003
I sure hope Mr. Jack
plays his game good today.

278
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:10,003
Otherwise he whups my ass
right well when we get home.

279
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:11,712
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack?

280
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:14,710
You know, Ted, Kenneth here is one of our
most promising young pages.

281
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:16,883
He knows everything there is
to know about the business.

282
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:20,012
I studied TV theory at
Kentucky Mountain Bible College.

283
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:22,391
I studied fried chicken
at the school of hard knocks.

284
00:11:22,596 --> 00:11:23,802
Ain't that right, Mr. Jack?

285
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,101
You still here?

286
00:11:25,316 --> 00:11:27,603
I'm ridiculous.
I'm black!

287
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,481
I may even be ugly.

288
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:31,980
But dear God...
I'm here!

289
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,402
I'm here!

290
00:11:33,618 --> 00:11:38,113
And nothing but them
can keep me from it!

291
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:48,790
Oh, I'm so sorry.

292
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:49,501
I'm so sorry.

293
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:50,500
I thought I turned it off.

294
00:11:50,717 --> 00:11:52,921
No, Cooper, take the call.
I mean, come on.

295
00:11:53,085 --> 00:11:58,010
This isn't Hitler's bunker.
That would make me Hitler.

296
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:58,513
What?

297
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:00,011
This is the new me.

298
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:02,011
Do you like the new me?

299
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:06,011
Before you answer, superballs!

300
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:07,182
Awesome!

301
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:11,310
What a fun boss you have, right?

302
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:15,813
Would you like me to do a tap dance for you
and your big time friends, Mr. Jack?

303
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,693
Or I could run around while
y'all are throwing rocks at me.

304
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,611
Kenneth, play this hole for me, would you?

305
00:12:20,787 --> 00:12:23,610
Come with me.

306
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:26,992
What are you doing?

307
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:27,913
Payback.

308
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:29,701
The way you treated me.
You used me.

309
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,711
God, it's like dating
Katie Couric all over again.

310
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:32,290
I didn't use you.

311
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:35,580
I created a situation that could have been
mutually beneficial, and you blew it.

312
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:38,883
If you can't handle Tracy Jordan,
don't invite Tracy Jordan.

313
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:41,010
This is what I do.
I drop truth bombs.

314
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,013
I don't care about Don Geiss!

315
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:45,093
I'm a movie star!

316
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,010
Oh, my.

317
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:48,682
No, no.
You were a movie star.

318
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:51,180
You haven't gotten a movie made
in over two years, and you know why?

319
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,481
Because of your truth bombs.

320
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,693
Remind me, Tracy, what did you tell
the president of Warner Brothers?

321
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:55,692
Told him he could suck it.

322
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:56,610
And the president of Paramount?

323
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,400
Told her she could
kiss my delicious ass.

324
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:01,781
And how's that working for you?
Yeah, I thought so.

325
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:04,610
Hey, why don't you play the game with me?

326
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,911
Like it or not, guys like Geiss
run everything, including movie studios.

327
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,081
And we could be playing golf
with him right now instead of Ted,

328
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:15,923
who's best known for getting caught using
a corporate credit card at a gay strip club.

329
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:21,801
I'm sorry, Amanda, you were bound
to find that out eventually.

330
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:30,600
Where is everybody?

331
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:33,100
Oh, they all had personal problems
they had to take care of.

332
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,101
Go, go.

333
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:37,480
If I thought I left my coffeemaker on,
I wouldn't be able to focus either.

334
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,813
No, no, I get it.

335
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:41,782
Everyone should see
Mama Mia before it closes.

336
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,993
What kind of sinus stuff?

337
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,490
I'm just having some weird sinus stuff.

338
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,491
Okay. Go home.

339
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:53,791
Then I sent Lutz and Frank out to get us
some pizzas and they never came back.

340
00:13:54,006 --> 00:13:55,790
So you're finishing up everyone's
re-writes by yourself?

341
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:56,713
That's not right.

342
00:13:56,925 --> 00:13:59,001
Yes, but at least I know
that nobody hates me today.

343
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:03,301
You think Jack Donagee sits up there and worries
if people are saying bad things about him?

344
00:14:03,516 --> 00:14:04,381
It's different for women.

345
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:05,381
I don't think it is.

346
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,010
Sometimes people hate their bosses.

347
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:07,892
Big deal.

348
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:09,600
But you gotta stick up for yourself.

349
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:15,020
Because if you don't...
they'll take advantage of you.

350
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,391
Oh, hey, could I borrow 60 bucks?

351
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:22,193
I'm going to meet Frank and Lutz at Scores.

352
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:29,781
So I founded the Don Geiss
Diabetes Research Foundation

353
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:33,081
which is why you're all here tonight.

354
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:36,503
Gwen and I really hope you'll be
as generous with your checkbooks

355
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:41,591
as you were on the links today
with your scorekeeping.

356
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,382
Thank you.

357
00:14:47,885 --> 00:14:50,092
What's he doing?

358
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,802
Excuse me!

359
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:56,101
I know I wasn't asked to say anything,
but I would like to share my experience with you.

360
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,390
When my daughter Shahita was born,

361
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,692
she had chubby arms
and legs and a big bald head.

362
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:05,193
She looked like
my Uncle Rupert in a diaper.

363
00:15:05,407 --> 00:15:07,612
By the time she was five,
she was 87 pounds.

364
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:09,703
I mean, she could eat!

365
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:11,702
But then, when was around
eight years old...

366
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,200
I remember it was Easter.

367
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:19,290
We stayed up all night the night before
watching bible movies and eating Fiddle Faddle.

368
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:21,793
I remember the next day, Easter Sunday,

369
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:26,592
she threw up right
in the middle of the Jaguar dealership.

370
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:28,592
She was mad sick.

371
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:32,801
And I carried her all the way
to St. Luke's Roosevelt.

372
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,891
The doctor said she had diabetes.

373
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,601
I get very upset because
I think I was the cause

374
00:15:38,817 --> 00:15:42,190
of that due to my ignorance of nutrition.

375
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,310
And I promised Sha that night...

376
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:50,112
that I was gonna dedicate
all my efforts to raise awareness...

377
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:52,910
and finding a cure.

378
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,782
And I just hope that
all of you will join me.

379
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,582
Thank you.

380
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:07,502
Unbelievable!

381
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:09,380
Record donations.

382
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:10,880
I can't thank you enough.

383
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:14,683
Jack, I'm gonna be on
the Vineyard next month.

384
00:16:14,896 --> 00:16:17,013
I want you and Tracy to come up,
and we'll talk about

385
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:19,020
getting you back in the movie business.

386
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,102
I'll set that up, sir.

387
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:21,391
Okay.

388
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,101
Tracy, bring your daughter.

389
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,193
That's a deal.

390
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:25,900
Thanks again.

391
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,113
Congratulations, Tracy.

392
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,281
And welcome to the grown up world.

393
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:30,692
Yeah.

394
00:16:30,905 --> 00:16:34,281
I don't have a daughter.

395
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:40,293
Let's have a casting session on Monday.

396
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:52,011
Grace...

397
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,180
There is something
that I must say to you.

398
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:56,600
But my words cannot suffice.

399
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:59,681
So to quote Mr. Jerry McGuire....

400
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:02,981
you make me a complete person.

401
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:07,111
When you said hello,
you had me.

402
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:11,902
My wife needs her sweater.

403
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:12,402
Ow!

404
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:15,112
Yes, sir!

405
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:19,200
You're watching the Designing Women Marathon
on Nick at Nite.

406
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,580
Sir, you may be right.

407
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:23,583
I may be not capable of understanding
normal thinking

408
00:17:23,797 --> 00:17:26,582
because I think a woman is just
as powerful as a man.

409
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:28,592
And until you learn to respect me,

410
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,010
you better learn
to stay out of my way.

411
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,593
'Cause this is my house.

412
00:17:37,517 --> 00:17:40,512
This is my house.

413
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,903
Staying up all night re-writing
The Amazing Hobo.

414
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,191
You fat nerd.

415
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:52,280
Good morning, Lemon.

416
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:54,190
Hey, Jack, come on!

417
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,493
You stay up all night?

418
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,703
How can you tell?

419
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,783
This is the men's room.

420
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh!

421
00:18:05,505 --> 00:18:07,213
Did you win your golf parade?

422
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,423
Even better.

423
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:12,501
Next weekend Tracy and I are gonna
double team Don Geiss with our big ideas.

424
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:13,803
You're so weird.

425
00:18:14,016 --> 00:18:16,722
Now get out of here.
I have to yell at my staff.

426
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:22,392
Because I'm not just feminine,
I also can project my power.

427
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:29,190
Didn't you bake us anything?

428
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,821
Hey, I thought you were gonna
being snickerdoodles in.

429
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:33,321
That's the only reason I showed up.

430
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:36,783
I mean, you can't promise snickerdoodles
and then not bring any.

431
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:39,622
That's not cool.

432
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,202
Listen up, everybody.

433
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:41,910
Listen to me.

434
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:42,581
Listen!

435
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,081
Shh shh shh shh shh.

436
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,913
There will be no more baked goods.

437
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:48,211
No more walking all over me.

438
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,291
I was here all night doing your work.

439
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:53,003
But at 3:30 this morning,

440
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,722
I happened to see this episode
of Designing Women.

441
00:18:56,887 --> 00:19:00,181
And when it came on again at 5:30,
I taped it.

442
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:02,601
And I want you all
to watch very closely.

443
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:08,192
Because it sums up so perfectly
what I wanna say to you.

444
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,812
What do I hit, input?

445
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:12,480
Is there a TV/VCR button?

446
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:13,983
What is aux?

447
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,482
Hey, can I go now?

448
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:16,190
Hang on.

449
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,991
I want your full attention!

450
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:24,082
Why is it making that noise?

451
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,501
Ugh.

452
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:29,792
Okay, never mind.

453
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:34,000
But I want to say something to all of you.

454
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,591
I am the boss here.

455
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,383
And sometimes that's gonna
make me unpopular.

456
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,511
But the point is...

457
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:44,102
I know what you called me, Lutz.

458
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:45,391
Oh.

459
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,680
I'm sorry that I said that.

460
00:19:47,897 --> 00:19:49,890
Please don't make me
move back to Alaska, Liz.

461
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:50,982
I hate it there.

462
00:19:51,195 --> 00:19:53,112
You can stay.

463
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:54,693
But if you ever...

464
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:58,690
If any of you ever call me
that horrible word again,

465
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:00,202
I will fire you.

466
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:03,413
And you will never alter drapes
in Atlanta again.

467
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:08,003
Because you do not cross
a Sugarbaker woman!

468
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,502
I'm so tired.

469
00:20:10,715 --> 00:20:14,080
I'm so tired, you guys.

470
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:23,301
All right, champ.

471
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:27,393
It's nonny time.



9999
