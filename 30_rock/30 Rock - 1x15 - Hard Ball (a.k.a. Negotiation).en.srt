2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,091
Wow, this is an honor.

3
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:13,138
I am friends with number four
on Maxim's list comedy.

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,014
Thanks.

5
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,558
At first I was mad that Jessica Simpson
was ahead of me.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,185
But then I saw the Dukes of Hazzard.

7
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,020
Funny!

8
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,271
What is that, baby oil?

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,234
Actually, they use salad dressing,
'cause it gets a better sheen.

10
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:26,360
This is ridiculous.

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,770
What does any of this have to do with comedy?

12
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:29,905
Ya burnt!

13
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:30,904
Listen, I just...

14
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,860
I wanna make sure you're not
gonna regret this, you know?

15
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,823
Because it's not just cute guys
that buy these magazines,

16
00:00:35,998 --> 00:00:38,782
it's teenage boys with weird rashes

17
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,871
and old guys that live at the Y.

18
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,162
Liz, posing in Maxim is a great career move.

19
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,463
There's no shame in it.

20
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,963
I'm laughin', I'm horny,
let's do this!

21
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:53,841
Put the chicken near your mouth.

22
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:57,893
Awesome.

23
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,221
Oh!

24
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,522
Well, you look happy.

25
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,310
Somebody just have
a root beer float?

26
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,530
No, Josh's contract is up, which means

27
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,361
it's time for my favorite thing
in the world, negotiation.

28
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:17,912
The essence of capitalism.
There's nothing like it.

29
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:20,371
God, I wish there was something
I could negotiate with right now.

30
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:22,121
Hey, Jack?

31
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:25,040
Just a reminder, I need a couple minutes
to go over breakage today-- how's noon?

32
00:01:25,216 --> 00:01:26,461
Can't do that.
Make it 4:00 AM.

33
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,332
That's no good.

34
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:28,501
What about after rehearsal?

35
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:29,131
10:00.

36
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:29,843
Stop insulting me.

37
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:30,501
3:00 AM.

38
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:31,041
Midnight.

39
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:31,712
You bring the coffee.

40
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:32,840
2:30, you bring the coffee.

41
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:34,343
That's my final.

42
00:01:34,515 --> 00:01:36,800
Done.

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:39,680
Wow, you do have a talent.

44
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:41,851
I can't wait to go mano a mano with Josh.

45
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:44,562
Right, I think you mean mano a toddler.

46
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:47,312
Josh is a very sweet,
very dumb kid.

47
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:48,650
Please go easy on him.

48
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:50,901
I'll try to remember that when you
and I meet with him later.

49
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,071
What, me? No.

50
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,363
Don't make me be part of this.

51
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:54,991
Lemon, I would like to teach you something.

52
00:01:55,155 --> 00:01:57,742
I would like to be Michelle Pfeiffer
to your angry black kid

53
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,031
who learns that poetry
is just another way to rap.

54
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,082
No, Jack, I don't wanna learn
about negotiation.

55
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,543
I just want Josh to stay.
The show needs him.

56
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:08,461
Lesson number one,
you don't need anyone.

57
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,830
Sure, Josh tests well
with female viewers 12 to 24,

58
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:11,922
which is important to advertisers,

59
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,673
because young women will buy
just about anything.

60
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,010
These sunglasses have a chip in them
that makes the lenses change color

61
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:20,262
as my iPod loses power.

62
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:24,310
But whatever Josh brings to the show,
he's still replaceable.

63
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,102
He's not replaceable as my friend.

64
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,390
He's not your friend now,
he's your opponent.

65
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:32,230
He's going to try to grab all the marbles,
and it's our job to hide them.

66
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:33,612
That's not how you play marbles, Jack.

67
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:37,531
But that's how you keep them.

68
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:42,532
Yo, remember that email we got
from those Nigerians

69
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,662
that needed our help gettin'
all that money out of Africa?

70
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:47,041
We did it!

71
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,413
I got the check today.

72
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,122
Say word?

73
00:02:49,298 --> 00:02:50,041
Word is bond.

74
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,633
I would have been happy
if our only reward was just helping

75
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:55,420
that dethroned prince of Nigeria,
but this is great!

76
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:56,760
We should treat ourselves.

77
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:58,840
Want to go to Vegas
and buy a bunch of sarcophagi?

78
00:02:59,016 --> 00:02:59,260
Nah.

79
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,760
I don't even use
the ones I have.

80
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,551
We could add someone else to the entourage.

81
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:05,012
That's a good idea.

82
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,021
Yo, what's young Larry doing these days?

83
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,433
He's in Jay-Z's entourage.

84
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:09,310
What about Cheese?

85
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:10,942
He's rolling
with Ghostface Killer now.

86
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:11,601
Fatballz?

87
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,022
Studying hotel administration at Cornell.

88
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:16,021
Well, go ahead, Fatballz!

89
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,940
That's a good program.

90
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,152
Hello there, Mr. Jordan.

91
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,533
Mr. Slattery, Mr. Griswold.

92
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,073
I picked up your lunch from Sylvia's.

93
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:23,822
Extra cornbread
because I know you like it.

94
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:24,412
Like it?

95
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,913
I love it!

96
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,793
I love this cornbread so much
I wanna take it

97
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:32,211
behind a middle school
and get it pregnant.

98
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:33,962
Pregnant cornbread.

99
00:03:34,135 --> 00:03:36,091
K, you like doing stuff for me, right?

100
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,553
How would you like to be in my entourage?

101
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:40,222
Well, that sounds like fun!

102
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,131
What would I do?

103
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,053
Well, let's see.

104
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:44,142
Dotcom does the driving
and the cooking.

105
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:47,312
Grizz is in charge of sitting on me
when I get over stimulated.

106
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:52,021
But I have been looking for someone
to harmonize with me.

107
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:54,023
The sun'll come out

108
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:55,562
Tomorrow

109
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:56,402
Tomorrow

110
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,571
Bet your bottom dollar

111
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,190
that tomorrow

112
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,441
Fa la la la

113
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,162
There'll be sun

114
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,072
This is a really special day.

115
00:04:05,247 --> 00:04:08,660
Just thinking about to--

116
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:28,560
Nice.

117
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,180
Yowza.

118
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,311
Isn't it great?

119
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:34,273
These are the sexiest women in comedy?

120
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:36,313
Where's Jackée?

121
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,482
Jenna, have you read your interview yet?

122
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:38,982
Oh, no.

123
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,192
Did I come across as interesting?

124
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,193
'Cause I tried to mention Bono
as much as possible.

125
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,492
No, you come across as crazy.

126
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,532
Why did you tell the reporter
that you hate the troops?

127
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,202
What?

128
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:52,252
I didn't say
I hate the troops.

129
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:07,053
but it's just
a bunch of gay guys

130
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:10,932
that like to get in silly costumes
and prance around.

131
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,722
No, Liz, he heard me wrong.

132
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,732
You know
that I love the troops.

133
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,520
Do you remember that fleet week
after I broke up with David?

134
00:05:17,697 --> 00:05:19,233
Oh, God, this is bad.

135
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:21,530
Nobody reads the articles
in these things, right?

136
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,361
Maybe no one'll pick it up?

137
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:30,080
These Hollyweirdos from La La Land
like Jenna Moron-ey are just un-American!

138
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:34,791
So we are calling for a boycott of NBC,
General Electric,

139
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:39,382
and their parent company
the Sheinhardt Wig Corporation.

140
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:41,092
Jack, I was misquoted.

141
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:41,803
This is my fault.

142
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,341
I never should have let her do
this Maxim thing in the first place.

143
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:45,920
We're going to nip this thing in the bud.

144
00:05:46,094 --> 00:05:50,050
Jenna is going to make a public apology
tomorrow on Hardball.

145
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,015
You know what that is, don't you?

146
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:51,934
Yes.

147
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:53,970
Should I prepare a song?

148
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:56,891
I really can't wait
to renegotiate your contract.

149
00:05:57,068 --> 00:05:59,982
Thank you, sir.

150
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:03,610
What?

151
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,280
Hey.

152
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,032
Does my vulva look swollen?

153
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:08,323
Come here.

154
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:11,533
I just wanna warn you as a friend
about this contract thing.

155
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,743
Jack is gunning for you.

156
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:14,953
Really?

157
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:16,912
Don't worry, you're not going anywhere.

158
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:21,591
Jack said advertisers love you,
because you test great with women 12 to 24.

159
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:22,542
Which advertisers?

160
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,303
Could I get free Choco Sticks?

161
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:28,182
Just don't be pushy about your contract,
and I promise we will get through this.

162
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,220
Yeah, um...

163
00:06:30,395 --> 00:06:33,893
Alan actually told me
not to talk to anybody about this.

164
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:35,060
Alan?

165
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:36,560
Who's Alan?

166
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:38,443
Jacuzzi, the whole nine yards.

167
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:39,692
Jack.

168
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:41,272
Jack Donaghy.

169
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:42,443
Alan Steiner.

170
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,273
Good to see ya.
I'm Josh Gerard's agent.

171
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:45,573
Oh, really?

172
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,573
Listen, I'd love to grab
a little face time with you

173
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:50,492
re: Josh's contract offer.

174
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:52,782
We've got some serious troubs, my friend.

175
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,490
We are not smiles-times.

176
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,913
I'm sorry to hear that, Alan.

177
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:59,000
What your skedge mañana?

178
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,840
'Cause this is gonna be one serious negosh.

179
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,502
My skedge is wide open, Alan.

180
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,260
Hasta mañana.

181
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:09,472
What a man, what a man

182
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:11,840
what a mighty good man

183
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,553
Mighty mighty good man

184
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:16,013
Yeah!

185
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:19,061
So, entourage, what's
on the schedule for today?

186
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,442
I have us penciled in for Halo.

187
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,852
I love Halo!

188
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:23,980
I love Halo so much,
I wanna take it out

189
00:07:24,155 --> 00:07:28,742
behind a middle school
and get it pregnant!

190
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,740
Why are you guys laughing so hard?

191
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:33,070
That's the same joke
Mr. Jordan said earlier.

192
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,620
I don't think so, K.

193
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,743
 'Cause I like
to keep my material fresh.

194
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,583
I like to keep things fresh so much,
that I wanna take it out

195
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:44,463
behind the middle school
and get it pregnant.

196
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:49,340
Whoa, who just killed me?

197
00:07:49,517 --> 00:07:50,471
That's never happened before.

198
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,551
I did, Mr. Jordan!

199
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:52,971
That's impossible!

200
00:07:53,146 --> 00:07:54,893
I've beat all the world's best players.

201
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,350
Grizz, Dotcom, my publicist,
my stylist...

202
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,643
Oh, well...

203
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:00,891
I just killed you again!

204
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,021
You're cheating!

205
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,401
And I don't wanna play no more!

206
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,860
I hate this!

207
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:06,611
Grizz!

208
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,993
I think it's best
you come sit on me.

209
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:17,661
And I just want the troops to kill everyone
and come on home.

210
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:18,992
Pretty good.

211
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,662
But this is Hardball, Jenna,
so you might wanna be more specific.

212
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,132
You could say
that you support the troops,

213
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,883
but you feel that the war was poorly planned

214
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,673
and started under false pretenses.

215
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:32,050
And that we should have used those resources
to hunt down Osama Bin Laden.

216
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:33,342
Liz, I'm just worried
that I'm gonna

217
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,143
sound like I don't know
what I'm talking about.

218
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,970
Hey, would Sharon Stone worry about that?

219
00:08:38,146 --> 00:08:38,932
Mm-mm.

220
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:40,432
Would Richard Gere?

221
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:41,602
No.

222
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:46,563
Then you go out there
and you voice your opinions like a star.

223
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay, what are you gonna do
if they ask about '08?

224
00:08:48,658 --> 00:08:51,033
Well, of course I want Hillary
to be the first woman president.

225
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:51,612
Ugh.

226
00:08:51,785 --> 00:08:52,442
No, Obama.

227
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:54,153
You support Barrack Obama.

228
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:56,491
Remember, you liked those pictures
of him at the beach?

229
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:57,870
Oh, right.

230
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:00,080
Obama, what is he, Hispanic?

231
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:00,953
No, he's black.

232
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,542
And he's running for President?

233
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,292
Good luck.

234
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,171
Is this new furniture?

235
00:09:11,348 --> 00:09:13,631
This is my negotiation set.

236
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:15,433
What?

237
00:09:15,595 --> 00:09:19,223
Gentlemen, please sit down.

238
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:29,061
All right, let's skip the foreplay
and get right to the penetraish.

239
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:33,363
Josh is looking for a 15% raise,
a two-pic guarantee from Universal,

240
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:36,702
and time off for every Jewish holiday
no matter how ridiculous.

241
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,411
I mean, Yaznach is coming up.

242
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,160
That seems pretty reasonable, right, Jack?

243
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:43,703
Here's my counteroffer.

244
00:09:44,088 --> 00:09:46,002
One dollar.

245
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:46,830
What?

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,623
Oh, boy.

247
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:48,542
 That's absurd.

248
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:49,543
You know what's absurd?

249
00:09:49,807 --> 00:09:55,920
These photos I found of Josh
roughhousing with Lance Bass at SeaWorld.

250
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:57,631
What, we were just being silly.

251
00:09:57,807 --> 00:09:59,140
My offer is now 75 cents.

252
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,891
Tic toc tic toc tic toc.

253
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,223
It keeps getting lower.

254
00:10:03,398 --> 00:10:04,430
I think we should take it.

255
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,312
Relax.

256
00:10:06,487 --> 00:10:08,192
Look, Jack...

257
00:10:08,355 --> 00:10:09,771
we know about the testing.

258
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:13,400
Women from 12 to 24...
love my guy.

259
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:16,032
Who told you that?

260
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:16,860
Oh, Liz did.

261
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:17,822
Shut up.

262
00:10:17,996 --> 00:10:18,611
What?

263
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,450
That was privileged information.

264
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,951
That's what I thought.

265
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:23,332
Awse.

266
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,913
We are back in the game.

267
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:31,922
I knew you weren't ready for a big chair.

268
00:10:36,557 --> 00:10:39,092
Yo, Kenneth,
we need to talk, man.

269
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:41,510
Oh, I've had this conversation before.

270
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:43,433
You're marrying my mom, aren't you?

271
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:44,431
No.

272
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,643
It's about how you're treating Tracy.

273
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,652
You're beating him at Halo,
you're not laughing at his jokes.

274
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,483
He's the king around here.
You gotta respect that.

275
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,402
Oh, my gosh.

276
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:56,150
I had no idea
I was causing a problem.

277
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:58,823
Hey, I got next game.

278
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,861
Hold up.

279
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:02,910
How are you beating Kenneth, Grizz?

280
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,032
I don't know.

281
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:06,501
If Kenneth can beat me,
and you can beat Kenneth,

282
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,871
then by the transitive property,
you should beat me too!

283
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,381
Have you been letting me win?

284
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,171
Just at some things.

285
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:15,130
Things?

286
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,710
Plural?

287
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:22,893
What is the world's
only egg-laying mammal?

288
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:24,220
The Easter bunny!

289
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:25,973
Right again!

290
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,811
That's a green pie piece.

291
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,773
Amazed.

292
00:11:29,948 --> 00:11:32,310
Raaah!

293
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:33,980
Yeah, what, cat?

294
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:34,940
Yeah, Dotcom!

295
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:36,482
Yeah, Grizz!

296
00:11:36,657 --> 00:11:39,151
Have you two been treating me
like this all this time?

297
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:40,363
Like a child?

298
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,701
No no no, I won't stand for this.

299
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,081
Entourage disbanded!

300
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:51,793
Oh, my.

301
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:53,961
Tucker Carlson, you heard
what Jenna Maroney had to say.

302
00:11:54,138 --> 00:11:55,133
She supports the troops.

303
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:56,093
Well, here's a question, Chris.

304
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:57,803
Why do we care
what she thinks about anything?

305
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,761
This woman strikes me
as another empty-headed

306
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,382
self-involved member
of the Hollywood ignorati.

307
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,512
You know, for someone
who's super super hot,

308
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:05,801
you're really cranky.

309
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:09,350
I have just as much right
to my opinion as you or Chris.

310
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:10,270
I'm not sure you do.

311
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:12,020
You've been on the show
for 20 minutes now.

312
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,901
You sang six bars of something
called Muffin Top.

313
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:15,481
Thank you.

314
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:18,360
And then told a disgusting story
about Fleet Week.

315
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,033
I guess this is the state
of political
discourse in this country nowadays.

316
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:22,362
And that's fine,
let's just embrace it.

317
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:26,031
Let's have our policies determined
by former Cable Ace Award nominees.

318
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,791
First, I was great in that Arliss.

319
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,411
Second of all, if they president is so serious
about the war of terror,

320
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,463
why doesn't he hunt down and capture
Barrack Obama before he strikes again?

321
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,251
It's time for a change, America.

322
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:42,803
That's why I'm voting for Osama in 2008.

323
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,971
Oh, no comeback?

324
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,681
Ya burnt!

325
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:57,311
Hey, Jack, I was totally gonna call you.

326
00:12:57,488 --> 00:12:59,941
Which of your massive screw-ups
should we discuss first?

327
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,113
How about the Jenna situation?

328
00:13:02,285 --> 00:13:03,451
That is taken care of.

329
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:05,821
I have written an op ed piece
for the New York Times

330
00:13:05,998 --> 00:13:09,622
under Jenna's name
in which I put the media on trial.

331
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:10,953
Boo!
Here's the plan.

332
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:12,661
We're gonna take Jenna,
put some flags behind her,

333
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,422
have her sing a song that rhymes USA
with "Make them pay,"

334
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,331
dress her in an eagle costume,
and we're gonna call it

335
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,631
a salute to the troops episode.

336
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,251
Okay.

337
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:20,842
Moving on, Josh Gerard.

338
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,593
I had him right where I wanted him.

339
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,510
Until my partner
stabbed me in the back.

340
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:26,932
I didn't mean to do that.
I'm sorry.

341
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:28,892
I was just trying
to give my friend a head's up.

342
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:34,851
Why can't we all just sit down
in normal chairs and figure this out?

343
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:36,981
Suri, is Josh in yet?

344
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,401
Josh isn't coming in today.

345
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,191
He's sick.

346
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:40,572
He said he was throwing up all night.

347
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,232
A sick out?

348
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,611
I didn't think
he had it in him.

349
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:44,861
What are you talking about?

350
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:45,573
He's faking.

351
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:47,611
He's gonna stay home
until we give in to his demands.

352
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:51,121
No, Josh could not come up
with a sneaky plan like that.

353
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,331
He told me he was a pallbearer
at his brother's wedding.

354
00:13:54,506 --> 00:13:57,170
He's probably just sick
because he's stressed out about his job.

355
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,092
Lemon, what happened in your childhood
to make you believe that people are good?

356
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:00,922
You know what?

357
00:14:01,096 --> 00:14:03,592
If my friendships
and my job are in compatible,

358
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:05,303
I choose my friends.

359
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:07,633
And right now, I am going
to get some chicken soup

360
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,101
from Josh's favorite place
and take it to him

361
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,432
and say that
I hope he feels better.

362
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:17,141
Do you ever get any emails
other than from match.com?

363
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:20,730
No no, don't look at that.

364
00:14:20,906 --> 00:14:22,820
Aaah!

365
00:14:22,985 --> 00:14:25,283
Damn it!

366
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:26,530
Close, right?

367
00:14:26,706 --> 00:14:28,161
Feel like I'm above the rim.

368
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:29,911
Can't palm the ball.

369
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:33,541
Sir, I think you made a mistake
firing Grizz and Dotcom.

370
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,663
They just wanna make you
feel better about yourself.

371
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,292
They disrespected me.

372
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,672
But don't you miss them?

373
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,710
You're the only one
I can trust, K.

374
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:42,213
You're my whole entourage now.

375
00:14:42,385 --> 00:14:44,551
Oh, I'm not so sure
I can handle that.

376
00:14:44,716 --> 00:14:45,762
Yes, you can.

377
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,973
Because you were honest with me.

378
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,763
I don't need a couple of yes-men.

379
00:14:48,936 --> 00:14:50,390
I need the truth.

380
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:54,011
Well, if that's the case...
then you should know

381
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,432
that you're never gonna dunk this basketball.

382
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:58,773
Also, that Oscar you have
is made of chocolate.

383
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:00,771
And that lady
you European kissed last night

384
00:15:00,948 --> 00:15:01,613
was actually a gentleman...

385
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,983
Okay, that's enough.

386
00:15:06,076 --> 00:15:07,531
Oh, here comes one right now.

387
00:15:07,696 --> 00:15:09,613
Excuse me, do you work for NBC?

388
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,203
Oh, no, I was just passing through
there on my way to church.

389
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,491
Well, are you interested
in taking back your country?

390
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:15,240
Am I!

391
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:22,132
Then join here tomorrow night
for a protest against the freedom-hating
Jenna Maroney and TGS!

392
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,502
There will be snacks!

393
00:15:23,678 --> 00:15:27,301
I will definitely be there.

394
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:29,093
Large chicken soup to go, please.

395
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:30,262
John and I saw your tape.

396
00:15:30,436 --> 00:15:31,393
Very very impressed.

397
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,432
You seem like a perfect match
for The Daily Show.

398
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:36,722
We are always looking for new correspondents.

399
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:40,230
Josh? You stupid turd.

400
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:43,020
Hey!

401
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,613
Liz.

402
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,522
This is...

403
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:46,650
Yeah, I can guess who this is.

404
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you trying to get on another show?
Behind my back?

405
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,741
Look, Liz, I'm sorry.
It's just business.

406
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,660
No, it's not business.

407
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:55,913
I stood up for you.

408
00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:59,041
You were opening for a puppet
when I found you.

409
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,463
How could you
betray me like this?

410
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,250
You know, that's not even
the worst part.

411
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,422
You know what
the worst part is?

412
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:08,052
You proved Jack Donaghy right!

413
00:16:08,215 --> 00:16:10,591
Again!

414
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:13,011
And by the way,
what kind of moron

415
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:15,723
calls out sick
and then comes to work to have a meeting?

416
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:17,103
I get an NBC discount here.

417
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,681
Idiot!

418
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:22,481
I'm a big fan of your show.

419
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:28,901
I want you to crush Josh.

420
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:32,490
I want you to crush him.

421
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,622
Mr. Jordan, Keith called on your cell.

422
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:40,702
He said they were "at the thing,
and Lil' Zay just end up running."

423
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:41,830
What did you tell him?

424
00:16:42,007 --> 00:16:44,581
Well, he wanted Dwayne Jr.'s number,
so I gave it to him.

425
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:45,670
You did what?

426
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,762
Damn it, K, now I have to hear
from Tanisha's mom on how
they both mad at the twins.

427
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,383
You have to handle this stuff better.

428
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,592
Mr. Jordan, I don't know
any of these people.

429
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:55,892
But Grizz would have...

430
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,510
Damn it, turn on the TV for me.

431
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:00,471
Dotcom set this up.

432
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,692
I don't know how it works.

433
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,813
Television on!

434
00:17:05,987 --> 00:17:08,692
Pornography!

435
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:11,073
Good, you're here.

436
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:13,073
Josh and his agent
are on their way up.

437
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:14,033
Ha ha, yeah.

438
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,701
Then they're gonna be on their way down.

439
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:18,083
Um, you know,
that was weak.

440
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,453
But you're in the mix,
you're having fun.

441
00:17:19,626 --> 00:17:20,663
I like that.

442
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,040
Gentlemen!

443
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,872
Make yourselves comfortable.

444
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:30,670
What are all these headshots for?

445
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:31,262
Nothing.

446
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,473
Just some meetings we're taking.

447
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:34,173
Meetings?

448
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:35,262
And if...

449
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:39,012
Look, Jack, I think I should tell you,
Josh has an offer from The Daily Show.

450
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:40,223
Yes, Liz mentioned that.

451
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,023
I don't think that's gonna pan out.

452
00:17:42,188 --> 00:17:43,023
What, are you kidding?

453
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:43,523
What happened?

454
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:44,732
What'd you do to our offer?

455
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:46,063
I called my friend
Saul Sheinhardt

456
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:49,153
at our parent company Sheinhardt Wigs
who called his nephew Morty Sheinhardt

457
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:51,822
who called his son, John Stewart.

458
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,190
 Ah ha

459
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,281
Ya burnt!

460
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:55,201
Let's get down to brass tacks.

461
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,033
Josh can stay.

462
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:56,823
Thank God!

463
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:58,413
But no raise, no movies.

464
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,620
And only one Jewish holiday.

465
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:00,663
What's the one
where they go into the tent?

466
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:01,330
Sukkot.

467
00:18:01,495 --> 00:18:02,411
That's the one.
We have a deal?

468
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,660
Deal, thank you.
I need this money.

469
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:07,211
I have a really bad sex addiction.

470
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,002
Sorry.

471
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:08,881
That's it?

472
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,212
I thought you said
we could crush him.

473
00:18:11,387 --> 00:18:12,210
What are you talking about?

474
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:13,262
I took away everything.

475
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,012
That's crushing.

476
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,260
No, do more stuff!

477
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:17,803
You made me look like an idiot.

478
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:18,932
You have to pay.

479
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,393
Liz, he's not getting a raise.

480
00:18:20,556 --> 00:18:23,270
Do the worm!

481
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,442
Do the worm!

482
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,521
Good Lord, the worm!

483
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:31,902
That's so degrading.

484
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,571
Are its origins German?

485
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,112
Now say five reasons
I'm better than you!

486
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:36,900
Smarter than me.

487
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:37,702
One!

488
00:18:37,865 --> 00:18:38,823
You can beat me
in arm wrestling.

489
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:39,781
Two!

490
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,910
You read the paper.

491
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,581
Yeah, suck it,
I do read the paper.

492
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,490
You want me to do anything?

493
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,243
Be a crab!

494
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:46,710
Crab.

495
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,000
Fight the worm!

496
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,420
Wow!

497
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:51,460
Liz, you took to this
like a natural.

498
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:52,670
More than I ever...

499
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:54,842
Okay, now, the crab
is getting aroused.

500
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,300
Shut it down.

501
00:18:56,475 --> 00:18:57,972
Shut it down.

502
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,263
Small town worn fatigues

503
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,801
Big dreams and little leagues

504
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,893
Gigantic star-spangled

505
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:06,060
fireworks

506
00:19:06,235 --> 00:19:09,310
Light up the night

507
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:11,811
You know, you actually
did a good job on this.

508
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:13,021
Why do you sound so surprised?

509
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,070
I love America.

510
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:16,691
Just because I think gay dudes
should be allowed to adopt kids

511
00:19:16,866 --> 00:19:21,201
and we should all have hybrid cars,
doesn't mean I don't love America.

512
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:23,661
I said America

513
00:19:23,835 --> 00:19:26,833
She said America.

514
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:32,843
And cue the pinwheels.

515
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,422
Okay, the pinwheels are lit,
but they're not spinning.

516
00:19:35,595 --> 00:19:38,802
When they're not spinning,
they look exactly like...

517
00:19:38,975 --> 00:19:41,550
Swastikas.

518
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,820
TGS, Totally Godless Suckers.

519
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:55,863
Or Satanists.

520
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,732
Ooh, that's even better.

521
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:00,071
Hi!

522
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:06,291
Entourage...

523
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,540
Oh!

524
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:09,791
You gotta get me out of here!

525
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:12,623
Make a path, please!

526
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,091
Help!

527
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,102
Wow, Tray, you really saved us
from that crowd, yo.

528
00:20:33,278 --> 00:20:34,233
You sure did, man.

529
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,402
You sure did.

530
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,193
Yeah.

531
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,861
Of course I did!

532
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,612
I love you guys.

533
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,741
I love you so much,
I'm gonna take you

534
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:45,870
behind the middle school
and get you pregnant.

535
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,202
I love you, Dotcom.

536
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,790
I love you, Grizz.

537
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:53,502
And I will always love you

538
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:59,000
And I will always love you



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
