2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,213
I thought Tracy was
getting here at noon.

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:05,964
Movie stars move at
their own pace, Liz.

4
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:07,382
We have to
accommodate them.

5
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,051
Yeah, well, a lot of people
are still upset

6
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,427
about Tracy
joining the show.

7
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,386
That's not
my problem.

8
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,846
I have other things
on my plate.

9
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,515
You hear about that chemical
factory explosion

10
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:15,800
outside
of Colorado Springs?

11
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,305
No.

12
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,649
Good.

13
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:18,358
All right,
here he comes.

14
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,063
I just think when it comes
to this whole Tracy thing,

15
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:23,601
it's best to
trlightly.

16
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:26,773
No, no, no.

17
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,613
Stop, stop.
Stop, stop.

18
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:32,571
It's just us.

19
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:35,452
Lemon, to tread
lightly is your job.

20
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,662
My job is to keep
Tracy Jordan happy.

21
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:39,951
Girls, girls, girls.

22
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,083
Let's save it
for Mr. Jordan.

23
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:44,670
Studio 68 is where
we do The Girlie Show.

24
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,793
Did you all see
Tracy Jordan

25
00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,380
make a special appearance
the other night?

26
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,501
Wasn't that exciting?

27
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:49,800
That is what we
in the show business

28
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,341
like to call a "cameo."

29
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:57,760
Hey, this is the star
of The Girlie Show, Jenna Maroney.

30
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:58,893
Hi.

31
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:01,643
Thank you.

32
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,233
How do you feel,
NBC tour?

33
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:11,402
'Cause you look good,
like a solid gold candy bar!

34
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,193
Where else do you have
those piercings on your body?

35
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,070
This is it,
everybody.

36
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,070
Here he comes.

37
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:18,780
Stop, stop, stop.

38
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:19,663
It's only Jenna.

39
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:21,333
All right, it's just Jenna.

40
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,750
How you doing, Jenna?

41
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:32,843
Okay,
I mean granted,

42
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:37,013
Tracy Jordan has some commercial appeal,
but within his remunenerative body of work

43
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:38,840
there's just
nothing of value.

44
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,143
What are you
talking about?

45
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,930
Did you ever see
his stand-up?

46
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,851
Give up the butt,
ladies.

47
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:47,020
Give up the butt.

48
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:51,573
This is it, I mean it.
Here he comes.

49
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:00,870
He's an imbecile.

50
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,700
Well, he's our imbecile now.

51
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:14,132
I'm just surprised he's
still got his shirt--

52
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:17,382
Oh, there it goes.

53
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:24,013
Jack!

54
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,143
Oh, my goodness!

55
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:27,433
It's good to see you
again, brother.

56
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,271
It's good to see
you again.

57
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,440
Oh, that is fantastic.

58
00:02:30,605 --> 00:02:31,943
You have to teach me
that handshake one day.

59
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:35,111
Listen, Tracy,
if there's anything you need,

60
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:37,403
anything,
you come to me.

61
00:02:37,578 --> 00:02:39,490
Come on, Jack,
you know I'm the kid.

62
00:02:39,665 --> 00:02:41,700
I'm easy like
Sunday morning.

63
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,621
Don't look at me!

64
00:02:42,786 --> 00:02:44,280
Do not look at me
in the eyes.

65
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,913
Do not look at
Mr. Jordan!

66
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:49,873
Do not look at him
in the eye.

67
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:55,171
Just look away.
Look away.

68
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,323
Tracy, this is our producer,
Pete.

69
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,113
Hey!

70
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:23,371
Hey, Pete.

71
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:24,830
You smoke weed,
right, Pete?

72
00:03:24,995 --> 00:03:27,543
Uh...
No.

73
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:28,873
Yeah, me neither.

74
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,791
Me and you, Pete.
Me and you.

75
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:33,291
Pete.
Good to see you.

76
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:34,670
Is it?
Oh, good.

77
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:35,790
It's good
to see you too.

78
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,711
'Cause that means
I'm not fired anymore.

79
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,882
I wasn't gonna
mention that.

80
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:40,763
But I did.

81
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:44,050
And now
I'm talking about it.

82
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,602
Relax your balls,
Pete.

83
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:51,141
Hey, everybody.

84
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:54,520
Tracy Jordan's here.

85
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,740
Don't just sit there.
Come and give me some sugar.

86
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:00,822
No, thank you.

87
00:04:00,996 --> 00:04:03,700
Well if you ever want to piss off
your parents, you come see me.

88
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,450
Right this way,
Tracy.

89
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,620
This is Tim Grandy.
He's from Bowie, Maryland.

90
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:09,332
Rachel Baze,
she just got engaged.

91
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:11,622
Josh Girard,
he got 760 on his SATs.

92
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:12,960
Graduated from
SUNY Courtland.

93
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,962
Frank Rossitano has every copy
of Black Tail magazine ever published.

94
00:04:16,136 --> 00:04:17,962
J.D. Lutz,
thyroid problem.

95
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:19,591
James Spurlock, 
but we call him Toofer,

96
00:04:19,766 --> 00:04:20,712
because with him
you get a "Two for One,"

97
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,420
he's a black guy
and a Harvard guy.

98
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,220
And, of course,
you know Lemon.

99
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,603
How did you do that?

100
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,430
It's my job.

101
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,142
Jerry from set design.

102
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:31,311
Wally,
cue cards.

103
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,940
Rupert Murdoch.

104
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:34,690
Melinda Gates.

105
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,612
Ziggy  from
the cartoon Ziggy.

106
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,443
Anthony Pellano.

107
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:40,783
Heidi Klum.

108
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,590
The guy that sleeps
with Heidi Klum.

109
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:45,783
This man's a genius.

110
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,452
Let me just say,
I'm excited to be here.

111
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:50,200
It's an honor for you
to meet me.

112
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,703
I've got a lot of characters
I'm ready to bust out.

113
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:54,500
I got a character
named Biscuit.

114
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:55,671
Write that up.

115
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,211
Got a another character
named Raylondo,

116
00:04:57,387 --> 00:05:00,050
who's a two-foot tall
Spanish hustler.

117
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,170
Glasses, I want you
to write that one.

118
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,091
Got another character
named Ching Chong,

119
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:06,180
who loves to play
Ping Pong.

120
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,101
I just made that up
right now.

121
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,600
'Cause that's
how I flow.

122
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,972
Now I'm up for anything.

123
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:14,483
I thought me and you could play
Seinfeld and Bill Cos--

124
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,980
No.
I don't like that.

125
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,240
How you doing?

126
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,703
There is no way I am
working with that guy!

127
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:34,501
Do you know that he once got arrested

128
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,213
for walking naked
through LaGuardia?

129
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,331
And that he once fell asleep
on Ted Danson's roof?

130
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,092
Yeah, Tracy has
mental health issues--

131
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,631
He bit Dakota Fanning
on the face!

132
00:05:44,806 --> 00:05:48,552
When you hear his version,
she was kind of asking for it.

133
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,470
I can't even believe that
you are doing this to me.

134
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,220
Listen, I understand
that this is tough for you.

135
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,981
But what did I tell you?

136
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:56,982
Not to freak out?

137
00:05:57,146 --> 00:05:58,150
Right.
And what else?

138
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,731
Stop falling in love
with gay guys?

139
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:02,232
About this.

140
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,481
That you're
looking out for me.

141
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,653
But  it doesn't seem--

142
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:06,241
Jenna, I'm your friend.

143
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

144
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,915
This show is called The Girlie Show,
and you are the girl.

145
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,959
Nothing is going
to change that.

146
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,418
Okay.

147
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,433
Glaub mir.

148
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:36,180
Diese "Advantium Microwaves"
sind die beste.

149
00:06:36,356 --> 00:06:39,440
How could you change the name
of my show without telling me?

150
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,483
Detlev, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

151
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,772
Yeah, wunderbar.

152
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:44,942
Plowchops.

153
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,951
The Girlie Show is now
T.G.S. with Tracy Jordan?

154
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,071
It tested very well
with the focus groups.

155
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:53,830
If you say you like it,
you can have some pizza.

156
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,122
You people like pizza?

157
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,451
You need to tell Jenna that
this whole thing was your idea

158
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,580
and that I didn't know anything
about it,

159
00:06:58,756 --> 00:07:00,830
and that she should
be mad at you, not me.

160
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:01,791
Oh, sure.

161
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,840
Then we could sit around
and braid each other's hair

162
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,921
until we get our periods
at the same time.

163
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,461
Look, Lemon,
you're a supervisor.

164
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,723
These people are
not your friends.

165
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,183
Yes, they are my friends.

166
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,221
No, they're your employees.

167
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:14,721
Well one of my employees
is extremely mad at me.

168
00:07:14,896 --> 00:07:15,642
Will you talk to her?

169
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,682
No, because then you're
not gonna learn anything.

170
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,443
You have to manage
these people, Lemon.

171
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,602
It's your show.

172
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:22,562
You have the tools.

173
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:23,811
Now get out there
and build the house,

174
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,283
add on a pool, and throw
yourself into the deep end.

175
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:27,400
What if I can't swim?

176
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,650
Then I'll do what my father
did when I was two.

177
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:31,910
Lure you to the edge
of the pool with a puppy,

178
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:32,870
and push you in.

179
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,622
Yikes.

180
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,790
Fine, I'll figure it out.

181
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,041
We're gonna be shooting
some promos

182
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,963
in an hour underneath
the new sign.

183
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,501
So have your people...
write some stuff.

184
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,301
So I said, "Rick, this chick's
got an Adam's apple."

185
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,130
And Rick said to me,
I'll never forget this.

186
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:56,640
He said, "Freaky deakies
need love too.

187
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:00,642
Freaky deakies
need love too."

188
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:03,230
Charming.

189
00:08:03,406 --> 00:08:06,692
So, how you doing over there,
Theo Huxtable?

190
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:08,073
I'm doing good.

191
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,151
Unh-unh.
Superman does good.

192
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:11,741
You're doing well.

193
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:16,070
You need to study
your grammar, son.

194
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,541
Wow. That was embarrassing
for you.

195
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,330
I don't even have lines
in these promos.

196
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,172
It's all Tracy
he doesn't even mention me.

197
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,173
I'll fix that.
Just stay calm.

198
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:30,133
Stay calm?

199
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:31,763
They changed the name
of the show.

200
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:33,220
You said that you were
looking out for me.

201
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,641
I am.
I will handle it.

202
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:40,432
Lemon, Lemon.
Can I be real with you?

203
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:41,982
Yeah.

204
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,982
I haven't had a real job
in like two years.

205
00:08:45,155 --> 00:08:46,441
I'm not used to
all these--

206
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:47,983
These cue cards
and all of that.

207
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:49,320
Don't worry about
the cue cards.

208
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,153
Look, you have two lines.

209
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:52,280
Just say,
"Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan,

210
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,400
I'm bringing the black
back to NBC."

211
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm proud as a peacock,
baby."

212
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,241
You  don't even
need these.

213
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:01,540
You're right.
I got this!

214
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:03,370
Thanks for looking out
for me, Lemon.

215
00:09:03,546 --> 00:09:04,580
I'm gonna crush it.

216
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:09,340
Show these people
how a movie star does it.

217
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:15,631
A little to your right,
Tracy.

218
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:21,101
Okay, here we go.
In three, two--

219
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:24,563
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

220
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:27,483
And I'm proud as a peacork,
baby.

221
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:29,441
That's great, Tracy,
but it's peacock.

222
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:30,232
What did I say?

223
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:31,532
Peacork.

224
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,742
Peacock.
Think peacock.

225
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:34,782
Right, Jenna?

226
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:37,163
In three,
two--

227
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:41,082
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan,
and I'm bringing the black back to NBC.

228
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:43,793
And I'm proud as
a pea cock, baby.

229
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,750
Okay.

230
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,330
That time I think you may have
hit it a little bit too hard.

231
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:52,422
Also, can you throw Jenna's
name in there for me?

232
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,972
In three, two--

233
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,682
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

234
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,012
Right, Jenna Mulvaney?

235
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,561
Maroney.
Rhymes with Baloney.

236
00:10:02,726 --> 00:10:03,431
Here we go.

237
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:05,230
In three, two--

238
00:10:05,398 --> 00:10:09,060
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan, and I'm
bringing the black back to NBC.

239
00:10:09,237 --> 00:10:12,321
And I'm proud as a peacock.
Right, Mabaloney?

240
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,400
Nope.

241
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,573
In three, two--

242
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,702
Hi, I'm Tracy Jordan.
I'm black, NBC.

243
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,870
Very proud,
like peacocks.

244
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,992
Right, Janet?
I think we got it.

245
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:27,252
I think we got it.

246
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah,
I think we did.

247
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,090
Okay, that was
beyond insulting.

248
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:34,880
The guy doesn't even
know my name.

249
00:10:35,058 --> 00:10:36,423
Why do you
love him so much?

250
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:39,301
No, no, no, no! 
I don't love him.

251
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:40,931
Donaghy loves him.
That's it.

252
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,763
Pete can't stand him,
Toofer thinks he's an idiot.

253
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,522
Even Cerie
says he's a pig.

254
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,770
Frank likes
his movies.

255
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:49,483
Frank also loves that video of the monkey
smelling his own butt.

256
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:50,102
Mmm.

257
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:53,443
Nobody wants Tracy Jordan here
except for certified

258
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:57,031
non-genius Jack Donaghy.

259
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,451
Sorry  to interrupt,
Ms. Maroney,

260
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,953
but the sound guys
want their microphone back.

261
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:02,621
So everyone can...?

262
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,332
Hear everything you are saying.
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,163
Oh my God. I didn't use
the N word, did I?

264
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:08,290
Oh, no, no, no,
Miss Maroney, you did not.

265
00:11:08,466 --> 00:11:10,541
Oh, good.
I mean, I never would, but, you know--

266
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:11,581
Jenna,
take the mic off!

267
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:13,501
Sorry.

268
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:17,552
Oh, my God.
That was bad, right?

269
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:20,471
It wasn't great.

270
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,140
Jack Donaghy
wants to see you.

271
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:23,893
No, no, no.
Tell him I'm very busy.

272
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,850
Come in,
she's very busy.

273
00:11:27,027 --> 00:11:29,353
Mr. Donaghy,
I sincerely apologize.

274
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:30,690
I'm so embarrassed.

275
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,770
I guess you must
be embarrassed

276
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:34,062
if you're hiding
in the storage closet.

277
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,151
This is my office.

278
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:36,982
Really?

279
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:38,363
I see you bring
a little feminine magic

280
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:40,070
to everything you touch.

281
00:11:40,246 --> 00:11:42,410
How did it go with Tracy Jordan
when you apologized?

282
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,161
I didn't think I needed
to talk to him.

283
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,662
I mean, he's not my friend,
he's my employee.

284
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:49,202
No, he's not your employee,
he's your product.

285
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:51,581
Like it or not, you're in
the Tracy Jordan business now.

286
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:53,790
And when you screw the pooch
the way you did today,

287
00:11:53,966 --> 00:11:56,712
it's your responsibility to get
in there and make things right.

288
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:59,012
How do I do that?

289
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,722
I don't know.
I'm a non-genius.

290
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm really sorry!

291
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,222
Lunch break,
that's a lunch break.

292
00:12:06,398 --> 00:12:07,973
Back in 30 minutes.

293
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:11,980
Tracy, I hope I didn't
hurt your feelings before.

294
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,232
Please.

295
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,690
You can't hurt me.

296
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,652
I did stand-up
on the road.

297
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:19,320
A crowd once threw
a motorcycle at me.

298
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:21,453
Good, 'cause, you know, I'm just
trying to calm Jenna down.

299
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,450
'Cause she's kinda
paranoid and neurotic,

300
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,782
and your being is just
bringing out all of her crazy.

301
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,791
Please don't think
that everyone hates you.

302
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:30,663
Pete thinks that
everybody's an idiot.

303
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:33,291
Especially Frank,
who is an idiot.

304
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,961
Josh is just jealous
'cause you're gonna get

305
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,252
more screen time
than him.

306
00:12:36,427 --> 00:12:38,422
And Toofer's just afraid
of black people.

307
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,463
Which one is Toofer?

308
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:40,422
The black guy.

309
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:41,170
Oh.

310
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,590
My point is,
don't worry about them.

311
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:46,893
You are the only person
that the network cares about.

312
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:47,643
Ms. Lemon?

313
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,680
I just wanted to let you know
y'all are on the monitors right now.

314
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:51,601
Everyone can--

315
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,690
Hear you and see you.
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:57,813
Son of a mother!

317
00:12:58,158 --> 00:12:59,272
Paranoid?

318
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,991
Well, that just confirms
all my suspicions.

319
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,160
Sorry, everybody.

320
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,683
Hey, buddies.

321
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:28,223
All right,
I deserve that.

322
00:13:28,397 --> 00:13:29,563
But I didn't say anything
about you guys

323
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,432
that I wouldn't have said
to your faces.

324
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:35,520
Fine. The important thing is
don't take this out on Tracy--

325
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:37,443
That dude sucks!

326
00:13:37,605 --> 00:13:38,903
Okay, are we going to talk
about this like adults,

327
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:43,033
or are you just gonna
throw things at me?

328
00:13:43,195 --> 00:13:44,703
All right.
Okay, fine.

329
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:46,660
Get it out of your system.

330
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:48,571
Nothing that plugs in,
you guys!

331
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:52,792
Nothing that could
really hurt me!

332
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,592
Hello.

333
00:14:01,755 --> 00:14:04,132
Lemon.

334
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,012
How are things
in the deep end?

335
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,430
Fine.

336
00:14:11,606 --> 00:14:13,390
The staff is meshing
together well?

337
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,773
Oh, yes, yeah.

338
00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,231
Good.

339
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:21,690
I'm counting on you.

340
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,661
We got to do something.

341
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:37,003
Let's crash my car
to see if the air-bags go off.

342
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,543
Let me explain what
I'm talking about first.

343
00:14:39,717 --> 00:14:42,713
Everybody is mad.
At us.

344
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:44,050
Mostly mad at you.

345
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,301
Yeah, well, that's
because Donaghy threw me

346
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,131
into the deep end of a pool
that I didn't even want

347
00:14:47,307 --> 00:14:49,091
to build in the first place!

348
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:51,221
Look, I'm just saying,
we both screwed up today.

349
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,140
I think we should make nice
and buy everybody some pizza

350
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:55,142
and some soft drinks--

351
00:14:55,318 --> 00:14:56,270
Nah, nah, nah.

352
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,270
This is what we're
gonna do, Lemon.

353
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,062
You're going to get
everybody on my yacht.

354
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:01,943
Harbor cruise.
Drinks.

355
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:03,112
Togetherness.

356
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,072
That's great.
You have a yacht?

357
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,240
I got a yacht.
I got a solid gold jet-ski.

358
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,782
Two Batmobiles.

359
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,492
The AIDS monkey's bones...

360
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:21,921
Welcome!
Welcome to your fantasy!

361
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:26,592
We're both hosting.
The ice cream bar was my idea.

362
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,303
This is surprisingly
tasteful.

363
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,971
Oh, yeah.
I've taken this boat many places.

364
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:33,722
Miami, Tokyo, Denver.

365
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,810
What does that mean,
Avanti Domani?

366
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:36,472
What?

367
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:37,431
The name
of the boat.

368
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,230
Oh, that's Spanish for
"remember your mother."

369
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,603
No, I don't think it is.

370
00:15:41,778 --> 00:15:45,023
Hello, boys.
I brought champagne.

371
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,112
I'm so glad you came.

372
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:46,982
Get away from me.

373
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:49,781
My Baloney!
Look at you. Wow.

374
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,742
Yeah, thanks.

375
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:54,993
Let me make you a drink.
You love apple martinis, right?

376
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,202
Yes, how did
you know that?

377
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,040
I read your interview
in Amtrak Magazine.

378
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:01,713
Really?
You saw that?

379
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,583
Mm-hmm.

380
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:03,543
Wow. 

381
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:06,753
Did you know that all the writers
in that magazine are also conductors?

382
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:07,592
I didn't know that.

383
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:11,180
Hey, Toofer,
see if I got any schnapps.

384
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:13,552
Good gravy.
This is a Dunwoody '62.

385
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,010
It's for you.
Take it, my friend.

386
00:16:16,186 --> 00:16:18,771
Thank you.

387
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,782
That is just wasteful.

388
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:32,573
I  hear you sing.

389
00:16:32,748 --> 00:16:33,860
I didn't know that.

390
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,370
Why don't you sing
something for me?

391
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,581
Oh, no.
Nobody wants to hear that.

392
00:16:38,746 --> 00:16:39,040
I do.

393
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:45,083
Some folks like to get away,
take a holiday from the neighborhood

394
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:50,463
Hop a flight to Miami Beach
or to Hollywood...

395
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,890
Let's get out of here.

396
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:59,260
Is that a real song?

397
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,392
It's going well, right?

398
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,190
It has to,
it has to go well.

399
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,650
Relax, everybody's
having a great time.

400
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:09,780
How's Jenna?

401
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:10,820
Furious and drunk.

402
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,403
But at least she's
getting along with Tracy.

403
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,610
Well, he does know
how to throw a party.

404
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,160
Think we're ever
gonna leave the dock?

405
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:16,663
I don't know.

406
00:17:16,826 --> 00:17:20,410
The engines haveeen running
for like three hours.

407
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:22,543
Hey, hey! Grizz!

408
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,210
Grizz, don't wreck
this boat!

409
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,921
Grizz is driving
the boat?

410
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't worry.
He was in the Navy.

411
00:17:39,478 --> 00:17:39,933
I got one,
I got one.

412
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:43,232
Jerry Seinfeld
and Bill Cosby!

413
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,481
What's the deal
with pudding?

414
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,523
I'm Bill Cosby.
Jell-o! Sweaters!

415
00:17:47,698 --> 00:17:50,361
Whoo! Yeah!

416
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:53,153
That doesn't even sound
like the Cos.

417
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,242
I'm gotta go lay down.

418
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,070
Got you on
that one, man.

419
00:17:56,248 --> 00:18:00,703
He got you again, man.
Get better references.

420
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:02,872
Tracy, thank you so much
for doing this.

421
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:04,371
You totally saved me.

422
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:05,543
You don't have to
thank me, Lemon.

423
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:06,500
We're a team now.

424
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:07,542
Like Batman and Robin.

425
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,421
Like chicken and
a chicken container.

426
00:18:10,598 --> 00:18:11,670
Hey, where's
your bathroom?

427
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,590
Second door
on the right.

428
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:18,681
All right,
let's do another one.

429
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,811
That's weird.

430
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,743
Por favor,
no me dueles.

431
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:39,953
Me llamo María.

432
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:40,452
What?

433
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:43,542
Please calling
Ted and Nancy Peabody.

434
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,410
You tell Who Dat Ninja
is on the boat.

435
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,460
What are you saying?

436
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,633
Tracy Jordan
is on the boat.

437
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:51,383
He no see me.
I hidden from him.

438
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,463
I hide from him.

439
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:55,672
Oh, my God.

440
00:18:55,847 --> 00:18:57,933
It's Spanish for,
"Remember Your Mother."

441
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,642
I've taken this boat
to Denver.

442
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:03,223
You can have that scotch.
Grizz was in the Navy!

443
00:19:03,395 --> 00:19:04,813
It's not his boat!

444
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,441
Sir, you need to
disembark immediately.

445
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:10,900
This is not his boat!
We gotta get off this thing!

446
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,360
This is not his boat!

447
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,403
Disembark immediately.

448
00:19:15,577 --> 00:19:17,530
Is this your boat?

449
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,033
Disembark immediately.

450
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:28,040
Run! Jump!
Get out of here!

451
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,141
Good morning.

452
00:19:44,305 --> 00:19:46,390
Morning.

453
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:48,311
Okay,
you were right.

454
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm sorry?

455
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,562
I can't do this.
I can't manage these people.

456
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,153
It was a disaster.

457
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,440
What are you talking about?
Everybody loved your little Lemon party.

458
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:58,820
I think it brings the team together
like a harrowing experience.

459
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,901
You pulled it off.

460
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:00,531
Really?

461
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:01,660
They bonded.

462
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,322
Good job.

463
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,663
Okay.

464
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:08,953
I guess now I just have to read about
how Tracy Jordan tried to steal a boat.

465
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:09,791
No, I took care
of that.

466
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:12,331
The Peabodys will be getting
some free rides on the NBC jet.

467
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:13,832
There won't be anything
in the papers at all.

468
00:20:14,008 --> 00:20:17,420
Really?
What about this?

469
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,593
Well, I had to give them
something.

470
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:20,092
Ugh.

471
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:23,261
Don't worry.
She's gonna love it.

472
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,353
That's just insulting.

473
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,933
Liz, Liz, did you see me
in the Post?

474
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,350
Oh, my God,
it's so embarrassing.

475
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,773
Look how thin I look.
And look how many emails I've gotten.

476
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:35,610
It's not even
8:00 AM in L.A.

477
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:36,981
Should I call Stern?

478
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:40,071
You're welcome.
