at you, not me.

163
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,735
Oh, sure.

164
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:04,964
Then we could sit around
and braid each other's hair

165
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:07,166
until we get our periods
at the same time.

166
00:07:07,275 --> 00:07:08,606
Lemon, you're a supervisor.

167
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,871
These people
are not your friends.
Yes, they are my friends.

168
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:13,038
No.
They're your employees.

169
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:15,547
Well, one of my employees
is extremely mad at me.

170
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,617
Will you talk to her?

171
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:19,186
No, because then you're
not gonna learn anything.

172
00:07:19,287 --> 00:07:21,585
You have to manage
these people, Lemon.

173
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,179
It's your show.
You have the tools.

174
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,623
Get out there and build
the house, add on the pool,

175
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:27,217
and throw yourself
into the deep end.

176
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:28,522
What if I can't swim?

177
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,825
Then I'll do what my father did
when I was 2.

178
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:33,730
Lure you to the edge of the pool
with a puppy and push you in.

179
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,803
Yikes.

180
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,768
Fine.
I'll figure it out.

181
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,806
We're gonna be shooting
some promos in an hour

182
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:41,704
underneath the new sign.

183
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,403
So have your people...

184
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:46,480
write some stuff.

185
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:51,079
So I said, "Rick, this chick's
got an Adam's apple."

186
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,119
And Rick said to me...
I'll never forget this...

187
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:57,351
He said, "Freaky-deakies
need love, too."

188
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,790
Freaky-deakies
need love, too.

189
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,890
Charming.

190
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:07,092
So how you doing over there,
Theo Huxtable?

191
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:08,998
I'm doing good.

192
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,401
Nuh-uh.
Superman does good.

193
00:08:11,506 --> 00:08:12,939
You doing well.

194
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,499
You need to study
your grammar, son.

195
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:21,507
Wow.
That was embarrassing for you.

196
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:26,119
I-I don't even have lines
in these promos.

197
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,949
It's all Tracy.
He doesn't even mention me.

198
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:30,115
I'll fix that.
Just stay calm.

199
00:08:30,224 --> 00:08:31,020
Stay calm?

200
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,649
They changed the name
of the show.

201
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,193
You said you were
looking out for me.

202
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:36,160
I am.
I will handle it.

203
00:08:37,532 --> 00:08:39,966
Lemon. Lemon.

204
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:41,467
Can I be real with you?

205
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:42,695
Yeah.

206
00:08:42,804 --> 00:08:45,796
I haven't had a real job
in like two years.

207
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,933
I'm not used to all these
cue cards and all of that.

208
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:50,374
Don't worry
about the cue cards.

209
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,174
You have two lines.
You say, "Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan.

210
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:55,374
"I'm bringing the black back
to NBC.

211
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:56,882
I'm proud as a peacock,
baby."

212
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,542
You don't even need these.

213
00:08:58,653 --> 00:09:00,416
You're right.

214
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:01,613
I got this.

215
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,123
Thanks for looking out
for me, Lemon.

216
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:05,192
I'm gonna crush it.

217
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,989
TRAC Y: Show these people
how a movie star does it.

218
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,698
A little to your right,
Tracy.

219
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:19,398
Okay.
Here we go.

220
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:21,839
In 3, 2...

221
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,535
Hi.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

222
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:25,578
And I'm bringing the black
back to NBC,

223
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,148
and I'm proud
as a peacork, baby.

224
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,149
That's great, Tracy,
but it's "peacock."

225
00:09:30,251 --> 00:09:32,151
What'd I say?
"Peacork."

226
00:09:32,253 --> 00:09:34,483
"Peacock."
Think "peacock."

227
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:35,988
Right, Jenna?

228
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,990
In 3, 2...

229
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:39,753
Hi.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

230
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:41,920
And I'm bringing the black
back to NBC,

231
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,589
and I'm proud
as a pea-cock, baby!

232
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:45,666
Okay.

233
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:48,065
That time, I think you may have
hit it a little bit too hard.

234
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:50,831
Also, can you throw Jenna's name
in there for me?

235
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,875
In 3, 2...

236
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,501
Hi.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

237
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,637
And I'm bringing the black
back to NBC.

238
00:09:59,747 --> 00:10:01,908
Right, Jenna Malvaney?

239
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:04,075
Maroney... rhymes with baloney.
Here we go.

240
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,085
In 3, 2...

241
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:07,745
Hi.
I'm Tracy Jordan.

242
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:09,982
And I'm bringing the black
back to NBC,

243
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:12,889
and I'm proud as a peacock,
right, my baloney?

244
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:13,892
Nope.

245
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:16,429
In 3, 2...

246
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:19,557
Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan.
I'm black, NBC!

247
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:23,068
Very proud, like peacocks.
Right, Janet?

248
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:24,536
I think we got it.

249
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,539
I think we got it.

250
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:30,573
Yeah.
I think we did.

251
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:33,905
That was beyond insulting.

252
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,778
The guy doesn't even know
my name.

253
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:37,373
Why do you love him
so much?

254
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,043
No, no, no, no, no.

255
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:41,815
I don't love him.
Donaghy loves him, that's it.

256
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:43,788
Pete can't stand him.
Toofer thinks he's an idiot.

257
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:44,915
Even Cerie says he's a pig.

258
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,755
Frank likes his movies.

259
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:48,351
Frank also loves that video

260
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:51,090
of the monkey smelling
his own butt.

261
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:52,860
Nobody wants
Tracy Jordan here

262
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:56,459
except for certified non-genius
Jack Donaghy.

263
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:57,469
[Door opens]

264
00:10:57,572 --> 00:10:59,403
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Miss Maroney,

265
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:01,304
but the sound guys
want their microphone back.

266
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:03,400
So everyone can...

267
00:11:03,511 --> 00:11:05,274
Hear everything you're saying.
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,176
Oh, my God.
I didn't use the N-word, did I?

269
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:08,942
Oh, no, no, no,
Miss Maroney, you did not.

270
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,075
Oh, good.
I mean, I never would, but...

271
00:11:11,185 --> 00:11:12,777
Jenna, take the mike off!
Sorry.

272
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:15,253
[Sighs]

273
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,587
Oh, my God.
That was bad, right?

274
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,024
It wasn't great.

275
00:11:21,362 --> 00:11:23,125
Jack Donaghy wants to see you.

276
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:24,823
No, no.
Tell him I'm very busy.

277
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:26,661
Come in.
She's very busy.

278
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,299
Mr. Donaghy,
I sincerely apologize.

279
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:31,666
I'm so embarrassed.

280
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:32,761
I guess you must be
embarrassed

281
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,933
if you're hiding
in the storage closet.

282
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,134
This is my office.

283
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:37,768
Really?

284
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,437
I see you bring
a little feminine magic

285
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,014
to everything you touch.

286
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,345
How did it go with Tracy Jordan
when you apologized?

287
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:45,510
Well, I didn't think I needed
to talk to him.

288
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,679
He's not my friend.
He's my employee.

289
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:50,154
No, he's not your employee.
He's your product.

290
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:52,453
Like it or not, you're in
the Tracy Jordan business now.

291
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,824
And when you screw the pooch
the way you did today,

292
00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:57,659
it's your responsibility to get
in there and make things right.

293
00:11:57,765 --> 00:11:59,289
How do I do that?

294
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,592
I don't know.
I'm a non-genius.

295
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:03,795
I'm really sorry.

296
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:07,370
<i>WOMAN ON P. A: Lunch break.
That's a lunch break.

297
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,840
<i>Back in 30 minutes.

298
00:12:08,943 --> 00:12:12,879
Tracy, uh, I hope I didn't
hurt your feelings before.

299
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,380
Please.
You can't hurt me.

300
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:17,451
I did stand-up
on the road.

301
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,076
Crowd once threw a motorcycle
at me.

302
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,451
Good, 'cause I'm just trying to
calm Jenna down

303
00:12:22,556 --> 00:12:24,683
'cause she's kind of paranoid
and neurotic.

304
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:27,818
Your being here is just
bringing out all of her crazy.

305
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,863
And please don't think
that everyone hates you.

306
00:12:29,964 --> 00:12:31,488
Pete thinks that everybody's
an idiot,

307
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,931
especially Frank,
who is an idiot.

308
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:34,967
Josh is just jealous

309
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:37,367
'cause you're gonna get
more screen time than him,

310
00:12:37,471 --> 00:12:39,234
and Toofer's just afraid
of black people.

311
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,069
Which one is Toofer?
The black guy.

312
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:42,073
Hmm.

313
00:12:42,176 --> 00:12:44,440
My point is,
don't worry about them.

314
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:47,673
You are the only person
that the network cares about.

315
00:12:47,782 --> 00:12:49,340
Miss Lemon,
I just want to let you know,

316
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,384
y'all are on the monitors
right now.

317
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:52,611
Everyone can...

00:20:14,194 --> 00:20:16,958
Really?
What about this?

480
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:20,066
Well, I had to
give them something.

481
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,501
Don't worry.
She's gonna love it.

482
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:26,004
That's just insulting.

483
00:20:26,106 --> 00:20:28,370
<i>Liz, Liz,
did you see me in the Post?

484
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,534
Oh, my God.
It's so embarrassing.

485
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,906
Look how thin I look.

486
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,639
And look how many e-mails
I've gotten.

487
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:35,044
It's not even 8:00 a. m.
in L.A.

488
00:20:35,149 --> 00:20:37,208
Oh!
Should I call Stern?

489
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,511
You're welcome.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
