2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:04,505
What class do you wanna take?

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,923
Oh, anything that doesn't have the word

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,259
"strip," "salsa," or "beatz"
with a Z in the name of it.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:11,595
Cardio Hip-Hop Groove it is then.

6
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,013
Hey, what's up?

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:13,847
Hey!

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,850
Nothing, just... going into
the same class you're going into.

9
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,311
Cool.

10
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:22,680
That's a flower guy.

11
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:23,940
Hey, I hope I don't sweat on you.

12
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:25,609
You can sweat on me.

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,861
This is my girlfriend, Liz Lemler.

14
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,192
Hi!

15
00:00:30,485 --> 00:00:31,492
That's Liz Lemon.

16
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,200
Oh, the girl who got my flowers.

17
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:33,823
Yes.

18
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:34,992
Hope you enjoyed them.

19
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:37,572
I did--actually, I finally just
threw them out this morning

20
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,202
'cause they got
that really bad flower smell.

21
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:43,962
I kind of couldn't stop smelling them.

22
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,293
Advanced hip-hop!

23
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,000
You ready, here we go!

24
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,753
Here we go, take it--
five, six, seven, and...

25
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,711
One, huh!

26
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:52,842
Hup, yeah!

27
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:55,180
Uh! Whoo!

28
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:56,720
Turn it!

29
00:00:56,896 --> 00:00:58,473
Don't give up, ponytail.

30
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:01,972
Come on, you got this.

31
00:01:03,318 --> 00:01:05,270
Lemon, come here,
you've gotta see this.

32
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,691
It's a video of a baby panda... sneezing.

33
00:01:08,867 --> 00:01:09,942
Sit here.

34
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,742
Don't watch the mother,
just watch the baby.

35
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,911
That is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

36
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,242
Isn't that adorable?

37
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,870
You have to fire 10% of your staff.

38
00:01:22,045 --> 00:01:22,492
What?

39
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:24,712
We're synergizing backward overflow.

40
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:27,123
I don't write the policy,
Lemon, I only enforce it.

41
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,131
No, but I've never
fired anybody in my life.

42
00:01:29,296 --> 00:01:30,882
It's an acquired skill.

43
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm not trying to make your life miserable,
but this is coming from the top.

44
00:01:34,017 --> 00:01:38,803
Now, there are 140 people on this show,
so go out there and make 126 people very happy.

45
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:39,890
No, I don't think I can do that.

46
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,183
Everyone that works
at this show is indispensable.

47
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:43,472
Marco.

48
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,100
Polo!

49
00:01:44,275 --> 00:01:44,433
Marco!

50
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,811
Polo!

51
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:46,100
Polo!

52
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,440
Polo!

53
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,572
Josh, you suck at this game, man.

54
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:13,050
10%? I can't fire any of these people.

55
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:13,633
Who cares?

56
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,921
Getting fired is better
than getting killed by my wife.

57
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:19,223
Those big farm people hands
crushin' my windpipe.

58
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,642
Everything okay at home, buddy.

59
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:24,521
Remember that little secret I told you
about Hornberger family planning?

60
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,141
You mean that you flat-out lied
about getting a vasectomy?

61
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,940
Don't tell me that backfired.

62
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,400
She's late now.

63
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,611
And she's starting to ask questions.

64
00:02:32,776 --> 00:02:33,362
Oh, boy.

65
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:34,481
Do you need a key to my apartment?

66
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:35,900
Just for my own safety.

67
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,530
Hey, Liz Lemon, you know
where I can find a good church?

68
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,032
How good, like Judaism good,
or just like Unitarian?

69
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,330
My attorney told me I should
join a church preemptively.

70
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:49,083
'Cause juries are suspicious of celebrities
who find religion after getting into trouble.

71
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,210
Why don't you try the Church of Practicology?

72
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,501
They love movie stars and stuff.

73
00:02:52,677 --> 00:02:53,923
They already turned me down.

74
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:56,051
I'm still not sure
what happened.

75
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,970
I believe the moon doesn't exist.

76
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,932
I believe that vampires are
the world's greatest golfers,

77
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,350
but their curse is that
they'll never get to prove it.

78
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,642
I believe that there are 31 letters
in the white alphabet.

79
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:10,730
Wh--what was the question again?

80
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,903
So what's your religion, Liz Lemon?

81
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:18,241
Mm, I pretty much just do
whatever Oprah tells me to.

82
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:21,781
Can I help you?

83
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:22,992
Yes, sweetheart.

84
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,322
I'm looking for Jack Donaghy.

85
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,660
And you are?

86
00:03:25,836 --> 00:03:27,911
Eddie Dona-hee, Jack's brother.

87
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:28,542
Really?

88
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:29,962
'Cause Jack never mentioned a brother.

89
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,420
And his name is Dona-gee,
not Dona-hee.

90
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,593
You know, you could be pretty
if you didn't scowl so much.

91
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,803
Tracy, this is Jack's brother, Eddie.

92
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:41,130
Hi.

93
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,680
Look who I found.

94
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:49,313
Eddie Donaghy.

95
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,690
As I live and breathe.

96
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,230
You're a disgrace!

97
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:56,193
You're not the boss of me, Jack Donaghy!

98
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:00,151
That's Dona-gee, not Dona-hee!

99
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:01,702
You ruined my suit!

100
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,280
Aw, shut up, you baby!

101
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:03,990
Oh, my God, stop!

102
00:04:04,165 --> 00:04:05,742
Someone's gonna get hurt!

103
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:08,160
Look, this is about Dad.

104
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,372
What'd you two dirtbags do now?

105
00:04:09,546 --> 00:04:11,500
Fix the Cotton Bowl?

106
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,042
Dad's dead.

107
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:17,171
It's over.
Okay?

108
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:23,341
This watch was Dad's.

109
00:04:23,515 --> 00:04:27,011
He wanted you to have it.

110
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:34,731
Are you okay?

111
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,271
Yeah, I'm okay.

112
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,980
I haven't seen my dad in 17 years.

113
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,742
I haven't seen Eddie
since I bailed him out of Disney jail.

114
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:44,072
And now this watch.

115
00:04:44,246 --> 00:04:45,240
I'm sorry.

116
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:46,413
Don't be.

117
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:49,873
My dad and Eddie are a blotch
on the Dona-hee name--

118
00:04:50,046 --> 00:04:52,871
Dona-gee name.

119
00:04:54,796 --> 00:04:56,501
That's how it's pronounced.

120
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:57,131
Say it.

121
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:57,712
Donaghy.

122
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,253
Right.

123
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,680
I really appreciate you bringing me
to your church, Ken.

124
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,012
Hola, Julio.

125
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:12,601
I'm glad to help you
on your spiritual quest, Mr. Jordan.

126
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:16,772
What kind of Presbyterian is this?

127
00:05:16,947 --> 00:05:19,900
No, we're the Eighth Day Resurrected Covenant
of the Holy Trinity.

128
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:21,733
We haven't been Presbyterian for months.

129
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,863
And y'all always meet on Wednesday nights?

130
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:28,573
Yeah, we lose half the congregation
every time American Idol starts up.

131
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,120
Reverend Gary's starting.

132
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:31,951
God sees the wicked one.

133
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:34,870
Eternal damnation is upon the sinner.

134
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,082
The stench of rotten flesh fills the air.

135
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:40,632
Judgment is upon us all!

136
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,050
How will you be seen in his eyes?

137
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:43,922
What?

138
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:45,593
He pointed right at me!

139
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,011
He sure did!

140
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,590
No!

141
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,973
The fires of the pit crackle and pop.

142
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:54,390
Hi, I got you coffee.

143
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:55,100
Thanks.

144
00:05:55,274 --> 00:05:56,560
Oh, I forgot your muffin!

145
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:58,449
Banana walnut, your favorite.

146
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,901
Uh, that's not correct, but okay.

147
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
Good morning, Liz.

148
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:04,741
What's all this?

149
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:08,530
Sketches, promos, web content.
Thoughts for next season.

150
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,532
Uh-huh. Nice hat.

151
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,492
You haven't heard anything
about layoffs, have you?

152
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,451
What? No!

153
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:17,001
And even if I had,
I'm just being normal.

154
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,371
Gosh.

155
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,170
Okay.

156
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:19,830
Hey, Liz!

157
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:20,922
You wanna hang out tonight?

158
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:22,670
'Cause you're totally my role model.

159
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:25,553
You make smart sexy.

160
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:26,881
There's my beautiful boss.

161
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:27,671
Good morning!

162
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,052
Good morning, Henry.

163
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,983
There you go.

164
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:39,691
The YMCA, huh?

165
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,401
Congratulations, you've found me out.

166
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,362
So your life's a mess,
you go out and buy a new suit,

167
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:46,573
pretend everything's okay.

168
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:48,452
But...what happened, Eddie?

169
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,492
What do you care?
I'm happy here.

170
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,371
Gordon, so help me!

171
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:56,701
Look, I went broke
taking care of Dad-- end of story.

172
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,002
Then let me give you some money.

173
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,120
No, seeing Dad at the end,

174
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:03,171
it changed me, Jack.

175
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,423
I got a real job now.

176
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:07,131
I talk homeless people
into joining the Army.

177
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:08,921
Isn't there anything that you want?

178
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:11,182
One thing.

179
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,601
I'd like my brother back.

180
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,891
Look, I know I've been nothing
but trouble to you your entire life.

181
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:20,230
Juvie, Jonestown,
that time I punched Goofy.

182
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,731
Hell, I even blinded you
with a bottle rocket!

183
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:25,442
Ah, that was for a couple
of lousy months, big deal.

184
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:27,032
I had sex with your prom date.

185
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:28,402
I stole your identity.

186
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:29,442
I threw you out of a window.

187
00:07:29,617 --> 00:07:30,861
I convinced you you had lupus.

188
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,323
I microwaved your parakeet.

189
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:34,321
I hated that bird.

190
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:36,292
We had some great times, didn't we?

191
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:38,751
Yeah.

192
00:07:47,097 --> 00:07:51,133
Hmm, you're on my good list, Cary.

193
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:03,061
Hey, sorry about that.

194
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,771
Not super appropriate...

195
00:08:04,948 --> 00:08:05,900
in the workplace.

196
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,322
No, it's...

197
00:08:07,485 --> 00:08:11,070
it's only inappropriate
when it's ugly people.

198
00:08:11,247 --> 00:08:13,700
So, um, how long
have you guys been together?

199
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,741
Oh, well... that's tricky.

200
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:18,451
Uh, kind of off and on the past year.

201
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,373
But then she got
this job here, and...

202
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:26,631
It's kinda tough to stay broken up
with someone you have to see everyday.

203
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:28,213
Where does she work?

204
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,210
Your Liz.

205
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,552
In accounting.

206
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,052
On your show.

207
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:35,303
She works for you.

208
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,772
I know who I can fire!

209
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,731
You can't fire the other Liz
unless she's in the bottom 10%.

210
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,243
Ugh, you can just tell she is
by her stupid face!

211
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:52,952
You're a better person than this.

212
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,110
Jack has given me absolute power.

213
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:56,953
I am the decider.

214
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:59,080
Okay, you can't just do this.

215
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,872
I'm not gonna just do anything.

216
00:09:01,047 --> 00:09:02,202
I have a plan.

217
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,421
Step one, befriend the enemy
and gather information.

218
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:09,383
Then use the information to drive her
into the bottom 10%.

219
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:11,510
Good Lord...your eyes.

220
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:14,930
You look like that lady astronaut
who tried to kidnap that other woman.

221
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:16,640
Hey, that was a lady with a plan.

222
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,353
Diapers, Mace, Houston to Orlando
in nine hours?

223
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:20,723
Blammo.

224
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,350
I know I'm the guy
who lied to his wife

225
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:25,442
about having a vasectomy,
but this...

226
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:26,693
this is wrong.

227
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:28,230
No, it's not wrong!

228
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:31,230
I'm just staying the course,
and I'm enjoying it.

229
00:09:31,408 --> 00:09:33,743
Jack is out of my hair,
people are being nice to me.

230
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:38,371
There's a guy I like in the building,
and I have the authority to fire his girlfriend?

231
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:43,621
For the first time ever, things
are lining up for old Liz Lemon.

232
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:46,172
Stop! Stop it!

233
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:47,622
Jack, come on.

234
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:50,040
Mr. Donaghy,
your assistant's been looking for you.

235
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,840
Oh, thank you very much, Kenneth.

236
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:57,221
Uh, Eddie and I have just been
making up for some lost time.

237
00:09:57,386 --> 00:10:01,050
Hey, Jack, uh, you mind
if I take a few grapes for dinner later?

238
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,473
Why don't you just take the money?

239
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,641
No.

240
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:06,140
If you wanna give money to someone,
you give it to those nurses

241
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:09,150
who took care of Dad
at Chicago All Saints Hospital.

242
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:13,441
They never once said anything
about the racist stuff towards the end.

243
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,651
All right, I'll have
my assistant write a check.

244
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:16,743
Help yourself to some grapes.

245
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,991
But you had to go to the bathroom,
so Dad missed seeing Meredith Vieira!

246
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:21,583
Now I'm pissed!

247
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,703
Not one of you kids is
ever gonna amount to anything.

248
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:26,541
That's why your mom left.

249
00:10:26,718 --> 00:10:28,372
Yeah.

250
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:31,041
Maybe we should get all the Donaghy kids
back together again.

251
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,671
Aw, Jack, they don't wanna see me.

252
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,673
Oh, come on, we're Irish.

253
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:37,513
We're a forgiving people.

254
00:10:37,677 --> 00:10:39,183
Aww!

255
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,970
I'm so glad you asked.

256
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:45,721
Kabbalah is a wonderful religion
that mixes the fun part of Judaism with magic.

257
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,183
So where do you worship?

258
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:50,102
Where don't you worship?
My friend, Madonna...

259
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:51,230
Hey, Jack's brother.

260
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:52,732
What religion are you?

261
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:55,650
This one sounds really expensive and gay.

262
00:10:55,827 --> 00:10:58,323
Oh, well, uh,
I'm Irish Catholic.

263
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:01,820
Now, I know there's been a lot of controversy
around the church lately.

264
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,951
You know, because of The Da Vinci Code.

265
00:11:04,126 --> 00:11:06,082
But what's great is you can do anything,

266
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:11,921
anything, and as long as you go
to confession, it's forgiven.

267
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:15,213
I'm Irish Catholic.

268
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:18,590
Well, well, other Liz.

269
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:22,971
Played saxophone
in the marching band at Rutgers?

270
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:25,511
Kept that a secret
from your employer, didn't you?

271
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:26,682
Excuse me, Liz.

272
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:29,140
Jack said it'd be okay
if I put this here.

273
00:11:29,316 --> 00:11:31,902
It's, uh, for the hospital
that took care of my dad.

274
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,572
Oh, yeah--I'm so glad to see
you and Jack getting along.

275
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,153
Uh, absolutely, we--
we'll give money, right?

276
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,440
You want us to give money?

277
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:40,363
I'd be happy to.

278
00:11:40,538 --> 00:11:42,240
Heart of gold, L.L.

279
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,120
Is there a limit
to how much we can give?

280
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,081
I hope not.

281
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,241
Let's get our checkbooks!

282
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:47,621
Yeah!

283
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:48,751
Wow.

284
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,293
I bet Pops is looking down
right now and saying,

285
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:57,171
"If I could come back and do any broad,
it'd be that one right there."

286
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,512
Ew.

287
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,103
So Pop says, "What does it
look like I'm doing right now?"

288
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:11,102
So they ended up landing
in Dallas for six hours and it was on the news!

289
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,402
It was not on the news,
you're such a liar.

290
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,192
Excuse me, everybody, this is Kenneth.

291
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:18,781
Kenneth, this is my family.

292
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,863
That's Patrick, this is Patricia,
this is Katherine Catherine,

293
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,742
and her husband Bobby,
and this is, uh, Margaret.

294
00:12:25,915 --> 00:12:27,411
We just found out about her today.

295
00:12:27,587 --> 00:12:28,912
Oh, uh, welcome!

296
00:12:29,085 --> 00:12:31,081
Kenneth's going to take you all
downstairs to the studio.

297
00:12:31,257 --> 00:12:33,173
I would like to make
a toast to Pop.

298
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,332
Well, we've been toasting Pop
for over an hour now.

299
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,002
Maybe we should pace ourselves.

300
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:39,132
You know what, why don't you stop trying
to control everything, Jack?

301
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,380
He was a wonderful father.

302
00:12:41,556 --> 00:12:43,932
He was always ready with a joke.

303
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:48,562
Or rum balls in his pockets for the kids.

304
00:12:51,816 --> 00:12:54,193
Eddie?

305
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,983
Come here, you magnificent douche bag!

306
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:02,530
Eddie!

307
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,110
How the hell are ya?

308
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:07,911
Have a drink.

309
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:13,461
Uh, actually I've been clean
and sober for seven months.

310
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,463
Stop showing off and have a drink.

311
00:13:17,635 --> 00:13:19,921
Sure.

312
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:25,882
Hey, Liz.

313
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,302
Oh, hey, Liz.

314
00:13:28,478 --> 00:13:30,893
Right, so I'm doing
these quick performance reviews.

315
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:34,521
I'm gonna be doing them with everybody
every six months or so, so, um,
are you settling in okay?

316
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:36,903
Yeah, everyone's been great.

317
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,273
Learning where stuff is.

318
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:41,071
What would you say are your weaknesses?

319
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:43,783
Some people say
I'm too nice.

320
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,863
Where do you see yourself in five years?

321
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:48,371
Well, hopefully,
I'll still be working for G.E.

322
00:13:48,535 --> 00:13:50,743
It's a great company for working moms.

323
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:51,493
What?

324
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,503
You know, in five years.

325
00:13:53,668 --> 00:13:55,213
In--I mean, I'm in a relationship right now.

326
00:13:55,378 --> 00:13:58,673
By then I'll probably have a couple of kids,
be living in the suburbs--

327
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,543
just having it all, really.

328
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,510
You're fired!

329
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,383
I'm the decider!

330
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,601
Uh...

331
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,230
God, I missed you guys.

332
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,523
It's too bad it took Dad dying
to get us all together again.

333
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:21,823
He was always bringing people together.

334
00:14:21,985 --> 00:14:23,613
He was just like Lady Di.

335
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:24,740
He was.

336
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,571
This is Margaret.

337
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,280
Boy, she's really got
Mom's smile, doesn't she?

338
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:29,992
Yeah.

339
00:14:30,168 --> 00:14:31,123
To Pop!

340
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:33,621
The sorriest bastard
that ever walked the earth.

341
00:14:33,797 --> 00:14:35,333
Don't say that about my daddy!

342
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,753
Oh, Patricia, you're embarrassing yourself.

343
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:43,091
Yeah, well, you don't say that
about my father, Mrs.!

344
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,302
What do you say...

345
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,762
Good posture, who cares?

346
00:14:46,926 --> 00:14:48,723
Uh, what do you say
we all head downstairs right now

347
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:52,721
before this takes the traditional
Donaghy turn for the worse.

348
00:14:52,896 --> 00:14:54,680
Seriously, don't even start with me!

349
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:58,060
Don't start with me, Mrs.!

350
00:14:58,235 --> 00:14:58,522
You did it, you fired her?

351
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:58,982
Uh-huh.

352
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,440
You cant' do that, Liz!

353
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:01,770
I'm gonna tell human resources!

354
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:03,022
No, no, you're not!

355
00:15:03,196 --> 00:15:04,571
You're fired!

356
00:15:04,735 --> 00:15:05,730
Did you just fire Pete?

357
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,861
Yes! I'm gonna put his name on a list!

358
00:15:08,035 --> 00:15:10,950
And everything!

359
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:14,662
Can I help you?

360
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:19,963
Ms. Lemon, the, uh, accounting department
wishes to protest the firing of our colleague.

361
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:20,963
Now, we have discussed it--

362
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,213
You're fired!

363
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,793
You're all fired!

364
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:25,001
Clean out your desks!

365
00:15:25,178 --> 00:15:27,550
Fired!

366
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:37,430
Lemon, the purpose of these cuts
is to make us more efficient
so we make more money.

367
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,190
And the people who tell me
if I'm making more money are called accountants.

368
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,600
And if I don't have any accountants--

369
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,273
No, Jack, you would be proud of me.

370
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:44,521
It's all part of a plan.

371
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:45,860
It just got out of control.

372
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,573
A plan to do what?

373
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,570
Things were really lining up for old Liz Lemon.

374
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,412
And this other Liz,
this accountant girl,

375
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:57,412
was just getting in the way
of my happiness.

376
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,502
Your happiness?

377
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:03,041
Lemon, is this about a boy?

378
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:04,670
Mm-hmm.

379
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:07,172
Good God in heaven.

380
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:07,713
Who is he?

381
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,211
What's his name?

382
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,261
Flower guy?

383
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:16,102
Lemon, you've gone chicken killer on me
over a guy whose name you don't know?

384
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,933
And you still think our next President
should be a woman?

385
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:22,980
He just seems like a really cool guy,
and I think he likes me more than her.

386
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:26,231
That's...very sad.

387
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:29,741
It really is, isn't it?

388
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:34,411
I'm gonna go talk
to some food about this.

389
00:16:37,626 --> 00:16:39,581
Oh, Liz, did you
put your check in already?

390
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:41,753
Oh, no.

391
00:16:41,915 --> 00:16:42,621
Who do I make it out to?

392
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:44,672
Chicago All Saints Hospital?

393
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,920
Eddie just said to write
the initials on the check.

394
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:48,463
C...

395
00:16:48,637 --> 00:16:49,551
A...

396
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,593
S...

397
00:16:50,766 --> 00:16:52,880
H.

398
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:57,972
Son of a bitch.

399
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:04,772
Eddie already took
the other box.

400
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:16,243
Son.

401
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,540
Dad?

402
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,662
Your brother Eddie's dead.

403
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,752
He wanted you to have his watch.

404
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,841
Eddie.

405
00:17:36,017 --> 00:17:36,760
You.

406
00:17:36,936 --> 00:17:37,852
Me?

407
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:39,473
You! What are you doing here?

408
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:40,060
What do you think?

409
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,771
I'm pulling
the Dead Man's Curve on Jack.

410
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:45,233
When we parted ways,
we agreed that I would get Jack

411
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,021
and you would do
the thing in Sacramento!

412
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,610
You are both a disgrace
to the Donaghy name!

413
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:54,031
It's pronounced Dona-fee,
you lace curtain half-an-Englishman!

414
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:56,151
When I think of all the things
that I've been holding

415
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:58,282
inside me that I wanted
to say to you...

416
00:17:58,455 --> 00:18:01,743
Well, now I'm gonna let St. Patrick
and St. Michael do my talking for me!

417
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:05,462
You'll have to get through Tip O'Neill
and Bobby Sands first!

418
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,421
You call those fist names?

419
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,093
Say hello to Bono
and Sandra Day O'Connor!

420
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,460
Those are the stupidest
fist names I've ever heard.

421
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,263
Daddy's not dead!

422
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:17,932
Eddie, you lying sack of crap!

423
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,011
Jack Donaghy, you don't raise
your fists to my dead father!

424
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,182
Bobby, give me my keys.

425
00:18:23,355 --> 00:18:24,183
Let's go!

426
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:26,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

427
00:18:26,526 --> 00:18:27,192
Yeah, what--what are you doing?

428
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,020
You can't fight in front of my audience!

429
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:33,650
What, do you think
you're better than me?

430
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:37,201
Lemon, are you okay?

431
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,832
I want you...to punch
your sister in the face.

432
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,533
It's on.

433
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:47,333
I call same sides
as the bicentennial brawl!

434
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,332
I was impressed by
how you take a punch, Lemon.

435
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:52,963
I played dead for the worst of it,
but it didn't fool your family.

436
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:54,422
It sure didn't.

437
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:57,633
The whole thing was strangely reassuring, though.

438
00:18:57,807 --> 00:19:02,053
To know that they'll be there after I'm dead,
fighting over my corpse before it's

439
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,060
cryogenically frozen.

440
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,930
Where's Eddie now?

441
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:10,732
I gave him and my dad a three-day
head start out of love and sportsmanship.

442
00:19:10,906 --> 00:19:12,273
Hmm.

443
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,861
As always, it's been a pleasure
fighting with you.

444
00:19:16,037 --> 00:19:19,863
Oh, I had to rehire that Liz Lemler
that you fired.

445
00:19:20,037 --> 00:19:20,823
Okay.

446
00:19:20,997 --> 00:19:24,830
And I didn't want any more trouble with her,
so I had to give her a promotion too.

447
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,042
Fantastic.

448
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:31,713
It's an amazing opportunity for her out at,
uh, corporate headquarters.

449
00:19:31,886 --> 00:19:32,920
In Connecticut?

450
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,841
She's transferred to Connecticut?

451
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:35,923
Yes.

452
00:19:36,098 --> 00:19:37,671
That's right.

453
00:19:37,848 --> 00:19:42,302
It seems that things are lining up
once again for old Liz Lemon.

454
00:19:42,475 --> 00:19:43,431
And you say?

455
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:44,812
Thank you, Jack.

456
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,892
You're welcome.

457
00:19:57,577 --> 00:19:59,400
I hear your girlfriend got transferred.

458
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:00,403
Sorry.

459
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:01,453
Yeah.

460
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:04,031
I guess it wasn't meant to be.

461
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:04,781
Liz!

462
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:05,783
You forgot to give me
the key to your place,

463
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:09,162
and I need it, my wife knows
about our little secret.

464
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,543
I don't know how she found out.

465
00:20:10,718 --> 00:20:11,582
Oh, God.

466
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:13,383
I should've just gotten a vasectomy!

467
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,463
Let me explain.

468
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,461
Hey, did you hear the good news, J. D.?

469
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,133
I'm IrisCatholic now.

470
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,973
Like you, Regis,
and the Pope.

471
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:24,603
Oh, no, you're not.

472
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,560
The church already has enough lawsuits.

473
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,470
See, I could screw up now,
and then just go to confession.

474
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:33,060
No longer do I have to throw my parties
in international waters.

475
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,443
That's not how it works, Tracy.

476
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:37,443
Even though there is the whole confession thing,
that's no free pass.

477
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:41,322
Because there is a crushing guilt
that comes with being a Catholic.

478
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:44,993
Whether things are good, or bad,
or you're simply eating tacos in the park.

479
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:49,241
There is always the crushing guilt.

480
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,081
I don't think I want that.

481
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:53,711
I'm out.

482
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:57,251
Somehow I feel oddly guilty about that.

483
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:01,381
I don't want nothing crushing me.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
