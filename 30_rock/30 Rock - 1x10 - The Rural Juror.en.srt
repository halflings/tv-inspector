2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,427
The flowers are lovely.
Thank you.

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,055
No, you hang up first.

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,389
Okay, on the count of three.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,850
One, two, three...

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,353
No, I didn't hang up either.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,980
Donaghy, I need your help.

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,191
I miss you too.

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,859
I said I miss you too.
You're breaking up.

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,520
Maureen?
She cut out.

11
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,365
I need $60,000,
or I'm gonna lose my house.

12
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,329
Which house?

13
00:00:33,498 --> 00:00:36,628
I need $100,000,
or I'm gonna lose both my houses!

14
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,660
Tracy, I don't understand.

15
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:40,993
You've starred in 14 films.
You don't have any money saved?

16
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,580
Nah, I lost all of it.

17
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,212
Really?
Who's your money manager?

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,751
Grizz.

19
00:00:45,926 --> 00:00:48,463
Worldcom, man.
Worldcom.

20
00:00:48,637 --> 00:00:51,263
Look, Tracy,
I can't just give you money.

21
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,720
But what I can do is show you
how you can earn all the money you need.

22
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,051
You must know Arsenio.
Hall or Billingham?

23
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:56,268
You know someone
named Arsenio Billingham?

24
00:00:56,268 --> 00:00:57,472
Put his name
and face on a product.

25
00:00:57,648 --> 00:01:01,273
Because of Arsenio's "woof-woof" catchphrase,
we settled on dog food.

26
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:06,102
The product was a runaway success.
The company and Arsenio made millions.

27
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:10,441
I like that.
Put my name on something.

28
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:12,190
But what would I sell?

29
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:13,861
The product is irrelevant.

30
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,032
The people aren't buying that.
They're buying you.

31
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,701
Now, you come back with an idea
of a product you'd be willing to sell,

32
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:24,710
anything at all, and you'll have
all the money you can dream of.

33
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,790
I'm on it.

34
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:29,250
I forgot about that Worldcom mess.

35
00:01:29,427 --> 00:01:31,843
Why you gotta be so obsessed
with telecommunications?

36
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:36,760
Get me Maureen Dowd
back on the phone, please.

37
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,282
Hey, I've got to miss
an hour of rehearsal today

38
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:04,412
because I just found out from my publicist
I've been booked on The View.

39
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,703
Oh, Jenna, that's great.

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,580
For the first time in your life,

41
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:09,582
you'll be in a room full of women
and you'll be the least crazy one.

42
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:10,921
I know.

43
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:12,041
(Liz) Oh, you know
what clip you should show?

44
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,250
"MTV: Darfur."

45
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,051
You and Tracy
were really funny in that.

46
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:18,132
Oh, this isn't for TGS.
It's for my movie.

47
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,763
The Rurr-Jurr has
a limited release next week.

48
00:02:20,936 --> 00:02:21,762
Oh, congratulations!

49
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,430
I didn't know they had
a release date for The Rurr--

50
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,140
For that movie.

51
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:29,062
Oh, sorry.
Gotta take this.

52
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:29,813
Hello?

53
00:02:29,987 --> 00:02:30,852
You still don't know
what the title is?

54
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,900
No! No one does.

55
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,902
It's gone on way too long
to ask her about it.

56
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,611
This title isn't hard
to understand, right?

57
00:02:37,787 --> 00:02:39,660
No, it's awesome!

58
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,121
I love that we can work
while we're on cocaine!

59
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:45,743
Could it be Roar Her,
Gem Her?

60
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,661
No, that doesn't make any sense.
It's got to be Oral Germ Whore.

61
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,753
Okay, bye.

62
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:52,712
Sorry, that was my publicist.

63
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,210
You know, I have to admit,

64
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:58,551
I kind of like that Tracy Jordan is no longer
the only movie star on TGS.

65
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,051
Maybe I'll finally start getting
some respect around here.

66
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:04,181
What's up, flabby butt?
You look weird today.

67
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,350
Hey, Pete, you wanna see a comic book
with pregnant zombie nuns?

68
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:09,022
Yes, I do.

69
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,100
Cool.

70
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:12,942
And I have a screener
of the movie for you.

71
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:15,902
I want you to watch it.

72
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:20,400
Ah, The Rural Juror!
That is something.

73
00:03:21,918 --> 00:03:22,911
I can't wait to watch it.

74
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,991
Oh, you won't be disappointed.
The source material was amazing.

75
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,040
It's hard to go wrong
with a Kevin Grisham novel.

76
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:29,830
- You mean John Grisham.
- Oh, no.

77
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:31,541
Kevin, John's brother.

78
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:35,843
Did you know that before Kevin was a novelist,
he worked at a recycling center?

79
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:36,752
Wow.

80
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,591
Yeah, and he just finished
writing a sequel.

81
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,671
It's called Urban Fervor.

82
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:45,140
Boy, these titles--
They really make you think.

83
00:03:45,307 --> 00:03:47,433
Oh, wow!

84
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:51,060
Doesn't it seem like just yesterday
we were doing the show back in Chicago,

85
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,981
dreaming about being in the movies?

86
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:55,943
We've come a long way
from that apartment we shared
in Little Armenia.

87
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:58,071
Oh, it was so weird there.

88
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,822
You remember that neighborhood festival
where they killed a goat in the street?

89
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,153
Yes!

90
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,821
But we did have really
good luck that year.

91
00:04:03,998 --> 00:04:06,282
Yeah.

92
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:10,581
I need to come up with a big idea
for a product to put my name on.

93
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:13,672
Something no one has thought of.
Something crazy.

94
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:16,292
I know a gentleman
who had a lot of crazy ideas.

95
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:19,213
He was a carpenter. 
He wanted everyone to love one another.

96
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:20,383
Oh, you mean Jesus?

97
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:25,263
No-- Miguel from set design.
He's over there.

98
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:34,140
Eurek-o!

99
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:41,443
Hey.

100
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,703
What are you doing back here?
They're rehearsing your Paris Hilton sketch.

101
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,742
I'm trying to avoid Jenna.
She gave me a screener of her movie.

102
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,573
And?

103
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:51,543
Oh, Pete, it's awful!
I couldn't believe how bad it was.

104
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:55,871
Although, I guess it's no surprise that
Tony Hawk can't play blind.

105
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,172
So you must know the title!

106
00:04:57,337 --> 00:04:59,922
Yes, yes-- The Rural Juror.

107
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,132
- The Rrr--
- Rural.

108
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:02,092
- The Ruh--
- Rural.

109
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:02,920
Eh.

110
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,682
(Pete) So, what are you gonna
do about Jenna?

111
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:06,840
(Liz) Same thing I've always done
when she's done something terrible.

112
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:11,892
Think of one thing nice to say
and then hug her.

113
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,350
So, what did you think?

114
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:15,390
Oh, my God!

115
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,981
You looked so beautiful.

116
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:27,573
The lighting was really neat.

117
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:36,670
Ethan and I both thought
the programs were really easy to read.

118
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:39,503
So, what nice thing are you going to say
about The Roaring Junior?

119
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:43,300
Uh, I don't know.
It's a mess.

120
00:05:43,465 --> 00:05:45,300
No, you've got to tell them
that when Paris Hilton

121
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,842
tries to make out with the bear,
the bear has to act like he's into it.

122
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:50,603
All right.

123
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:55,931
Mr. Donaghy, stop what you're doing
because I'm about to blow your mind!

124
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,523
Hit it!

125
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:00,861
Tired of your sandwich making you angry?

126
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,993
Then behold the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine!

127
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:06,863
Stick any three meats--

128
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:08,033
Whatever you want!

129
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:10,741
Bologna, salami, boar--

130
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,993
Whatever!

131
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:15,792
Into this sexy lady
and she will melt them all together

132
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:17,250
into one delicious food ball.

133
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:20,582
Never again will you have to suffer
through the bread part of your sandwich.

134
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:25,212
I give you the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine!

135
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:29,552
(all) Meat is the new bread! Uh-huh!

136
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,933
What do you think?

137
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:35,930
Well, it's certainly not the worst
celebrity product idea I've ever heard.

138
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:37,432
Hi, I'm Whoopi Goldberg.

139
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:41,691
And you're Working Out
With Whoopi.

140
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:44,820
With Tracy Jordan behind this,
it just might work.

141
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,190
We'll roll it out in time for Christmas.

142
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:49,281
Manufacture it for four bucks,
slap your name on it, and sell it for 50.

143
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,820
So GE will produce
the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine?

144
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,585
Oh, no. No.

145
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:58,299
GE could never make something so, um...
Unique.

146
00:06:58,468 --> 00:07:02,848
We'll have to pass this off
to one of our subsidiaries.

147
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,050
You see, GE owns KitchenAll of Colorado,
which, in turn, owns JMI of Stanford,

148
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,762
which is a majority shareholder
in Pokerfastlane.com,

149
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,931
which recently acquired
the Sheinhardt Wig Company,

150
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:14,260
which owns NBC outright.

151
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:18,312
NBC owns Winnipeg Iron Works
which owns the Ahp Chanagi Party Meats corporation

152
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:19,943
of Pyongyang, North Korea.

153
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,273
And they will make the Meat Machine.

154
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,321
Jack Donaghy,
you are the best.

155
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:30,452
(Tracy) You know what?

156
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:34,072
I'm gonna make you a mix tape.
You like Phil Collins?

157
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:36,873
I've got two ears and a heart, don't I?

158
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:38,292
All right, Jenna's on next.

159
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,921
Everyone shut up so we can hear the title
of this stupid movie.

160
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,793
And coming up,
I'll be talking to The Girlie Show star

161
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,802
Jenna Maroney about her upcoming project,
The Rrr-Jrr.

162
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:52,842
That is not helpful.

163
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:54,760
Hey, do you know the name
of Jenna's movie yet?

164
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,562
Oh, yeah, she gave me a screener.

165
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:57,813
- Okay!
- No, no, no--

166
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:59,311
I'm not telling you
anything about it.

167
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,813
I'm not giving you more ammunition
to make fun of her with.

168
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,653
So it's bad.

169
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,650
How bad?

170
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,150
Please!
Just give us one detail.

171
00:08:08,325 --> 00:08:09,323
Okay, fine.

172
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:14,743
Jenna plays a southern lawyer
named Constance Justice.

173
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:17,830
You gotta let us see this.

174
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:19,291
- No!
- Come on, Liz!

175
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,120
No!

176
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:21,331
Oh, man.

177
00:08:21,506 --> 00:08:23,333
Constance Justice.

178
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,542
Justice has been served.
Good stuff.

179
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:29,461
Tracy to the stage please for
Pull Your Own Wisdom Teeth.

180
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:30,210
(Jenna) Oh, excuse me.

181
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,173
Hey, there you are.

182
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:34,182
So, what did you think of the movie?

183
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:35,303
Oh, my God, Jenna!

184
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:39,141
The soundtrack was so moody.

185
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,352
What else did you like about it?

186
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:44,190
What? Oh, um...
You were good!

187
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:50,480
Your face was very expressive.
And another cool part was...the trees.

188
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:54,820
I gotta get back to work.

189
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,202
You didn't like the movie.

190
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,532
What?
Yes, I just said I like the movie.

191
00:08:58,708 --> 00:08:59,622
No, you didn't.

192
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:02,291
You did that condescending
compliment thing you always do.

193
00:09:02,456 --> 00:09:06,292
What? When have
I ever done that?

194
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:08,340
So, what did you think?

195
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:12,591
Oh, my God...
You looked beautiful.

196
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,973
The lighting was really neat.

197
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:24,311
Ethan and I both thought
the programs were really easy to read.

198
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:26,810
Well, that's not how
I remember any of that.

199
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,443
Look, Liz,
for once, be honest with me.

200
00:09:28,617 --> 00:09:30,272
I want your real opinion.

201
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,030
Okay, I thought the story
was preposterous.

202
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:35,860
I thought the acting
was way over the top.

203
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,243
And I thought it was about
an hour too long.

204
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,160
It's only 90 minutes.

205
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:41,743
It's kind of a train wreck.

206
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,412
A train wreck? Okay.

207
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:47,212
I'm not trying to be a jerk here.
You asked me for my opinion.

208
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:51,343
No, no--
I understand.
Thank you.

209
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,510
I wasn't kidding about how cool
those trees were, though.

210
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,931
What were they? Oaks?

211
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:02,311
Damn it!
Where are my car keys?

212
00:10:02,765 --> 00:10:05,271
Jack, Tracy--
What can I do for you?

213
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,943
Leo, we have a product
we want you to give a medical endorsement to.

214
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,110
I'll do it!
What is it?

215
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,400
It's called the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.

216
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:14,860
It's a dual-press grill.

217
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:15,940
Say no more.

218
00:10:16,118 --> 00:10:18,663
If it's giving people meat,
then I'm onboard.

219
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:22,122
I've always said
humans need more animal blood.

220
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,870
It keeps the spine straight.

221
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:25,001
We appreciate it, Leo.

222
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,621
You boys need anything
while you're here?

223
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:28,751
Some reds, yellows...

224
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:30,540
Just got some purples in from Peru.

225
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:31,503
No, I'm good.

226
00:10:31,675 --> 00:10:34,300
Well, it would be rude not to take, uh...

227
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,091
One or two.

228
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,971
Now, The Rrr Jrr
is the true story of Rory Jerner,

229
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:45,181
whose pure furor
ensures a terrible murder--

230
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:47,941
Excuse me.

231
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:51,273
I feel like I'm getting
further away from it.

232
00:10:51,448 --> 00:10:53,982
Hey, last night
I broke into Liz's office.

233
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,032
I got Jenna's movie.

234
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,361
Oh, how'd you get in there?

235
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,451
That weird security guard
Tony let me in.

236
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,282
I also looked on Liz's computer.

237
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:05,371
Her last two Google searches
were for singles yoga and scalp pain.

238
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,332
That is grim.

239
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:12,130
The Rural Juror?

240
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,880
Man, that's disappointing.

241
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:18,170
I had to let Tony watch me pee
to get that tape.

242
00:11:18,346 --> 00:11:20,260
What?

243
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,140
Hey, you wanted to see me?

244
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:24,561
Yeah, I don't want to wear
this Paris Hilton nose.

245
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,180
(Liz) I'm sorry.
You have to wear the nose.

246
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,643
There's a whole bunch of jokes
in the sketch about the nose.

247
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:33,230
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I think the entire sketch is a train wreck.

248
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,441
Oh, I see.

249
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:36,112
We're not talking about the nose.

250
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:37,863
We're talking about the movie.

251
00:11:38,036 --> 00:11:41,820
You're wrong about it, Liz.
It's getting some very positive early reviews.

252
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,783
Teenmoviescene.com gave it five out of five iPods.

253
00:11:44,957 --> 00:11:48,833
Jenna, believe what you want.
I'm your friend. I'm telling you the truth.

254
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:49,832
Please--

255
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,080
Here's what's really going on.

256
00:11:52,257 --> 00:11:55,420
It's killing you that
I'm in something good
that you had nothing to do with.

257
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:56,713
And now you're taking it out on me.

258
00:11:56,886 --> 00:11:57,751
Oh, come on!

259
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,463
Well, enjoy kicking me around for now, Liz.

260
00:11:59,638 --> 00:12:02,131
Because I won't be on your crappy
little show forever.

261
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,840
Really?

262
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:04,891
Really.

263
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:05,720
Really?

264
00:12:05,898 --> 00:12:06,682
Really.

265
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,222
Really?

266
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,893
Really.

267
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:14,521
Well, Jenna,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

268
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,482
Ow! What the hell?

269
00:12:16,658 --> 00:12:17,441
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

270
00:12:17,618 --> 00:12:22,110
I didn't know
there was a person in there!

271
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:28,160
Pete, could you tell Liz Lemon
not to stand in my eyeline
while I'm rehearsing, please?

272
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:33,421
Pete, could you tell Jenna
she smells like a stripper?

273
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:34,461
So, uh...

274
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:35,880
Are you guys still fighting?

275
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,751
We've reached kind of an understanding.

276
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,051
She's not talking to me.

277
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,423
And to retaliate,
I'm writing impressions for her
that she can't do.

278
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:47,012
I did not have sexual relations
with that woman.

279
00:12:47,185 --> 00:12:50,102
You guys can't go on like this.
You have to apologize to her.

280
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:51,141
I didn't do anything wrong!

281
00:12:51,318 --> 00:12:54,312
She insisted on me telling her
what I thought of her crappy movie.

282
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,401
And then she attacked me.

283
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,442
Liz, I can't have the head writer
and one of the stars of the show fighting.

284
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:06,570
I can barely keep a lid on the feud
going on between Kenneth and Dougie from props.

285
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:20,462
Audience, let me ask you a question.
How many times has this happened to you?

286
00:13:22,345 --> 00:13:24,800
Or this:

287
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:27,850
Seem familiar?

288
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,641
Bread is one of the worst
things in the world.

289
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,183
But we've always needed it.

290
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:33,602
Until now!

291
00:13:33,777 --> 00:13:37,653
By burning three different types of meat together,
The Tracy Jordan Meat Machine

292
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:40,483
takes bread out of the equation!

293
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:45,241
Now your sandwich is
all of the good stuff.

294
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,373
That's delicious!
And it's healthy.

295
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:52,490
Hi, I'm Doctor Leo Spaceman.

296
00:13:52,667 --> 00:13:57,292
I'm a working physician with a degree
from the Ho Chi Minh City School of Medicine.

297
00:13:57,466 --> 00:14:00,922
Doctor Space-man,
is it true that bread eats away at your brain?

298
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:07,551
We have no way of knowing
because the powerful bread lobby
keeps stopping my research!

299
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:08,682
Well, folks,

300
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,432
bread will never maybe
attack your brain again!

301
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,601
Because with the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine--

302
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:14,772
Say it with me now!

303
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:18,601
(all) Meat is the new bread!

304
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,901
Where did you guys get this tape?

305
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,111
Oh, Josh broke into your office.

306
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,281
You went in my office
without permission?

307
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,120
Because I'm worried
about your scalp pain.

308
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,043
Hello, everyone.

309
00:14:35,205 --> 00:14:36,123
Frank, could you tell Liz--

310
00:14:36,296 --> 00:14:39,542
Nope, not interested.

311
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,711
Girl writer, could you tell Liz
that I don't--

312
00:14:41,888 --> 00:14:43,171
Jenna, stop this.
It's stupid.

313
00:14:43,346 --> 00:14:44,631
Let's just go in my office and talk.

314
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:46,013
Oh, there is nothing to talk about.

315
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,420
Stop making this something it isn't.

316
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:50,470
I just didn't like the movie
because it's bad.

317
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:53,351
These guys watched it.
They'll tell you.

318
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:54,721
Actually, we all kind of liked it.

319
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:55,931
What? No, you didn't.

320
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:57,180
Yeah, we all did.

321
00:14:57,355 --> 00:15:01,400
It's not the best thing in the world,
but it's solid and Jenna's really good in it.

322
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,113
Thank you, Frank.

323
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,110
Look! Look at her!

324
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,691
She can't stand
that I'm in something good.

325
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,571
It's probably because
of her own intellectual insecurities.

326
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:10,160
What? Frank, shut up.

327
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:10,952
Fine, dismiss me.

328
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:13,740
I guess because I look weird,
I can't be perceptive.

329
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,873
I can't believe
you like this movie!

330
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,212
Oh!

331
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:22,582
Jeez, I hope those two work it out.

332
00:15:22,757 --> 00:15:23,843
Relax, man.

333
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,762
As long as they're yapping at each other,
we're not working.

334
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:27,922
Enjoy it.

335
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,511
I want these everywhere!

336
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:35,563
I want every person here
eating from a Tracy Jordan Meat Machine.

337
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:36,971
Ow, ah!

338
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,231
Cheese and crackers,
that smarts!

339
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,271
What happened?

340
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:42,352
The grease burned me, Mr. Jordan.

341
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,942
The machine must be broken.

342
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,732
That one must be defective.

343
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:52,032
Oh, ow! My face!
My page jacket!

344
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,873
They all must be like that!
Where's Donaghy?

345
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,082
Can somebody
take me to a hospital?

346
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:02,332
Jenna, stop.
I just want to get past this.

347
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,133
What do you need me to do?

348
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,420
Well, you can start
by saying you're sorry.

349
00:16:06,597 --> 00:16:08,552
To--
Fine.

350
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:13,973
I am sorry that I assumed other people
would hate the movie just because I hate it.

351
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:14,853
That was wrong.

352
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:16,221
That's it?
That's your apology?

353
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:17,852
Yeah. Are we good?

354
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:19,473
- We're good.
- Great.

355
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,100
So, do I have to wear the nose tonight?

356
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:21,850
Yes, you do.

357
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:24,863
Okay, well then
I hope you get bird flu and die.

358
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:25,811
What did you just say to me?

359
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,980
You are a big fake,
you know that, Liz?

360
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,861
She doesn't even need those glasses.

361
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:33,610
Really, I'm a fake, blondie?
I'm a fake?

362
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:37,493
Burning jets of grease, huh?
Were any of our people hurt?

363
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,331
- Only Kenneth.
- Good.

364
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:41,292
What are we gonna do?
We can't sell this.

365
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,171
You're right,
we can't sell this...

366
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,790
in the United States.

367
00:16:45,966 --> 00:16:46,543
What?

368
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:49,383
We simply have to find a market
with lax safety regulations.

369
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,511
With your international appeal,
we can go anywhere.

370
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:52,550
How about the Ukraine?

371
00:16:52,728 --> 00:16:53,510
Not the Ukraine.

372
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,553
I own some property
on the Dnieper River.

373
00:16:55,726 --> 00:16:56,432
In Volyn?

374
00:16:56,606 --> 00:16:58,061
Closer to Cherkasy.

375
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:00,770
Well, we'll find another country then.
How do you feel about Venezuela?

376
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,231
Can't do it, Donaghy.

377
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,651
I can't put my name on a product
that's gonna hurt people.

378
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,773
That's disappointing.

379
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:09,652
Although I admire your integrity.

380
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:11,993
Mr. Donaghy, 
they need you on stage immediately.

381
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:13,283
Some kind of emergency.

382
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:16,662
For crying out loud.

383
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,541
I'm sorry that we're not
all weeping with gratitude
at getting to read your words.

384
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:25,042
I am so glad
I studied voice at Northwestern
so I could do raps about Suri Cruise.

385
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:25,670
Oh, please!

386
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,251
If it wasn't for me,
you'd still be slutting it up

387
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,712
for car dealership owners
so they'd put you in their commercial.

388
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:31,763
Oh, so now I'm a slut? Yeah.

389
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,713
Let me tell you something.

390
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,552
This slut slept with your brother!

391
00:17:34,728 --> 00:17:35,262
Mitch?

392
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:36,803
Yeah, and let me tell you
something about Mitch.

393
00:17:36,977 --> 00:17:38,791
He is disgusting in bed.

394
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:42,352
You know he's not right.
He was in a really bad skiing accident!

395
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:44,940
Ladies.

396
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,033
Sit down.

397
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:58,952
Now, what is this about?

398
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,203
It's about my movie,
The Rrr Jrr.

399
00:18:01,378 --> 00:18:04,750
They've adapted The Rural Juror?
I'm a huge Kevin Grisham fan.

400
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,251
Jenna has taken the fact
that I don't like her movie

401
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:09,460
and blown it completely out of proportion.

402
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:11,340
She twisted my boob.

403
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,513
Liz, you wanted the movie to be bad.
You wanted me to fail.

404
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,303
Okay, let me tell you something, Jenna.
Liz has always supported you.

405
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:19,051
Even when I wanted you out of here,
she wouldn't give in.

406
00:18:19,227 --> 00:18:20,553
I've never seen her so worked up.

407
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,683
She came at me with that
angry little badger face of hers--

408
00:18:22,858 --> 00:18:24,181
There it is right now.

409
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:25,771
The point is,
she went to the mat for you.

410
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:26,641
And she was right.

411
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,101
- I know, but--
- But nothing.

412
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,773
Now you're accusing Liz
of undermining you?

413
00:18:29,947 --> 00:18:32,691
They did warn me those diet pills
were mood altering.

414
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah?

415
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,323
I think you owe her an apology.

416
00:18:35,495 --> 00:18:38,740
Oh, Liz...
I'm sorry.

417
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:43,700
No, don't be.
You're right.

418
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,502
I did want the movie to be bad.

419
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:46,040
Wow.

420
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:49,170
The one time I try to take your side, Lemon,
and you sandbag me.

421
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
I'm sorry, Jenna.

422
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,713
I smelled crazy in here
and I assumed it was you.

423
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,342
God, Liz, I mean--

424
00:18:54,518 --> 00:18:56,592
I wish you had written my movie too.

425
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,341
No, it's not that.
It's just--

426
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:02,601
The dream that we had in Chicago of getting famous--

427
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:03,851
We had it.

428
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,683
It was my dream too, Jenna.

429
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:09,440
Yeah, but you couldn't have been serious
about acting for a living.

430
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,522
You have brown hair.

431
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,403
Look, I like what I do now.

432
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,690
But there's still this sad little part of me
that wants to be the center of attention.

433
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,703
That wants to get my hair done
and get free clothes.

434
00:19:20,866 --> 00:19:24,662
That wants to be you,
I guess.

435
00:19:25,548 --> 00:19:28,332
And your movie just brought
all that stuff up again.

436
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,082
This is boring.
I'm bored now.

437
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:33,171
Oh, God, Liz.
I had no idea.

438
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,883
I'm sorry.
I'm a jackass.

439
00:19:35,058 --> 00:19:37,463
No, I'm sorry.

440
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,343
So you really think I'm beautiful?

441
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:41,723
I never said that.

442
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:44,723
Oh, I'm sorry.

443
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:48,771
Tell me (in russian): Feed me, Whoopi!

444
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:51,730
(all) Whoopi!

445
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:56,190
What's this?

446
00:19:56,368 --> 00:19:58,071
I gave the Meat Machine to Whoopi.

447
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,610
Goldberg or Billingham?

448
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:12,923
Looks like Whoopi's made herself
another billion grivka.

449
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,673
Food ball?

450
00:20:17,428 --> 00:20:18,920
Let's get personal.

451
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:22,761
Your father Werner was a burger server
in suburban Santa Barbara...

452
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:23,971
Yes, that's right.

453
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:29,102
When he spurned your mother Verna
for a curly-haired server named Roberta,

454
00:20:29,275 --> 00:20:31,731
did that hurt her?

455
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:35,693
It was hard on all of us, yes.

456
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,570
I'll always be his little girl.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
