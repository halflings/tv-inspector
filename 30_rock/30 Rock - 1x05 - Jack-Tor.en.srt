2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,630
/Tracy Jordan to the stage, please.

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,341
/Tracy to the stage.

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,842
Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,093
They've been paging you
for rehearsal!

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,803
Rehearsal?
We did a show last week.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,222
I just came
to pick up a paycheck.

8
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,724
No. We do a show
every Friday, Tracy.

9
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,808
It's not gonna work.

10
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:19,260
Next Friday is Damon Dash's
birthday party.

11
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,855
And the Friday after that there's an orgy over
at Elizabeth Hasselbeck's.

12
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:23,199
Yeah? Well, you're part
of a team now, okay?

13
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:25,778
So you have to be in the shows
and you have to rehearse.

14
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,402
And when you rehearse,
Jenna would really like it--

15
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:29,362
I would like it too--

16
00:00:29,536 --> 00:00:31,781
if you would read exactly
what's on the cue cards.

17
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,201
It's making everybody crazy.

18
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,360
Can't do it.

19
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:35,911
I'm an improviser.

20
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,080
My acting style is like jazz.

21
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,620
Jazz that you laugh at.

22
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:46,003
"Ah ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!"

23
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:48,133
Just try, okay?

24
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:51,340
I have a meeting upstairs.
I'll be right back.

25
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:52,011
Pete.

26
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,050
Do you remember that song
I recorded last year

27
00:00:54,227 --> 00:00:55,843
when I was dating
that Persian record producer?

28
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,181
Oh...no.

29
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,353
It's a dance-pop techno hybrid
called Muffin Top.

30
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,853
I gave everybody copies
at Christmas?

31
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:02,852
Oh, yeah, right.
I don't remember that.

32
00:01:03,028 --> 00:01:06,520
Well, apparently
it's a number-one hit in Israel.

33
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:08,773
Hey, Israel.
Wow. Yes.

34
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,443
And I noticed we had
a couple of minutes left,

35
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:11,940
so I thought maybe
I could do it on the show.

36
00:01:12,117 --> 00:01:13,240
Okay, you can do the short version.

37
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:15,740
You should know that Muffin Top
is also number four in Belgium.

38
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:16,611
I said you could do it.

39
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:19,323
Why not?!

40
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:22,830
Oh. I mean, thank you.

41
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:30,132
Hello.

42
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:35,632
For over a hundred years,
GE has been imagining the future... today.

43
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:40,181
And I'm here to talk to you today
about a wonderful new synergy.

44
00:01:40,356 --> 00:01:44,312
It's called "product integration."

45
00:01:44,475 --> 00:01:48,692
It's revolutionizing the way
we monetize broadcast television.

46
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,692
How does it work?
Simple.

47
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:54,280
All you have to do
as the writing staff of an NBC show

48
00:01:54,445 --> 00:02:00,951
is incorporate positive mentions--
or PosMens--of GE products into your program.

49
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:05,250
For example, you could write an episode
where one of your characters purchases--

50
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:08,830
and is satisfied with...

51
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:15,553
one of GE's direct-current drilling motors
for an offshore or land-based project.

52
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,263
Product integration...

53
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:21,721
setting a new standard
in upward revenue stream dynamics.

54
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:24,721
For all of us.

55
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:30,400
Now, I'd be happy
to answer any questions.

56
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:34,483
I'm sorry. You're saying you want us
to use the show to sell stuff?

57
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:35,980
Look, I know how this sounds.

58
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,572
No, come on, Jack.
We're not doing that.

59
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:40,360
We're not compromising the integrity
of the show to sell--

60
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:41,660
Wow. This is diet Snapple?

61
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,740
I know, it tastes just like
regular Snapple, doesn't it?

62
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,541
You should try
Plum-A-Granate.

63
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,540
It's amazing.

64
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:48,660
I only date guys
who drink Snapple.

65
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,422
Look, we all love Snapple.

66
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,710
Lord knows I do,
but focus here.

67
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,673
We're talking about product integration.

68
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,551
No, no. We are not your shills.

69
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,761
Oh! Oh-ho.
I'm sorry.

70
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,472
That's right.
They're artists,

71
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,431
like James Joyce
or Strindberg.

72
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:03,300
Get real, kids.

73
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:07,601
You write skits mocking our presidents
to fill time between car commercials.

74
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:08,770
That's not fair.

75
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:13,940
Josh gets a lot of fan mail
for Gaybraham Lincoln.

76
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,783
Did you guys know that Holland
is the only country with a national dog?

77
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:19,572
I didn't know that.

78
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:24,031
Hmm. There's little facts under there.

79
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,762
/That's a lunch break, everybody.

80
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:45,350
Back in an hour, please.

81
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,521
Um, did you talk to Tracy
about reading the cue cards?

82
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,311
I tried.

83
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:51,061
Well, he's not reading them.

84
00:03:51,238 --> 00:03:52,732
He never reads them, Liz.

85
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:56,111
I'm starting to think...
he can't read!

86
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,650
Oh, that-- that's just offensive, Jenna.

87
00:03:58,826 --> 00:03:59,741
I don't know.

88
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,030
Have you ever seen him
read anything?

89
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:03,411
Of course.
Like when we shoot promos.

90
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:06,531
Hi. I'm Tracy Jordan.
I'm black, NBC!

91
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:10,663
Very proud, like peacocks,
right, Janet?

92
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:13,081
Hmm.

93
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,502
Hey, Tracy,
I missed that last run-through.

94
00:04:15,678 --> 00:04:19,513
Could you run it once
off cards for me?

95
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:24,381
Naw, Lemon. 
I'll do that later.
I gotta bounce.

96
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,640
Okay, that's the--

97
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,813
It says, "Emergency exit only".
He couldn't read that?

98
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:34,851
Man, Jenna's really gotten squirrelly
since Tracy came along.

99
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:36,101
It's so sad.

100
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:39,151
What's really sad is that
while she's in this fragile state,

101
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,652
none of her friends
are messing with her head.

102
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,700
I think we should do
something about that.

103
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:44,743
Hmm.

104
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,661
Shh. Okay.
All right.

105
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,661
Hey,  what are you guys
talking about?

106
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,080
Oh. Uh...nothing.

107
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,082
What, is it about me?

108
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:53,793
Okay. Um...

109
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:58,173
There's a rumor going around
that Donaghy has to cut costs around here.

110
00:04:58,345 --> 00:04:58,752
Oh.

111
00:04:58,927 --> 00:05:01,882
Yeah. My friend in accounting,
Lando Calrissian,

112
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:05,262
he says Jack's probably gonna
have to fire an actor.

113
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:06,343
Oh.

114
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:10,312
Thank you guys for telling me.

115
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:19,192
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel.

116
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:22,073
Yeah, if the fish have daddy issues.

117
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:25,071
I can't believe you guys actually
wrote a product integration sketch.

118
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:26,703
Jack said we had to.

119
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:27,910
It just seems weird.

120
00:05:28,075 --> 00:05:30,410
This show's not a commercial.

121
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,161
Excuse me.

122
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:33,911
Can you tell me
where Human Resources is, please?

123
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:35,872
That way. Thanks.

124
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,790
This is gonna sound crazy, but, um...

125
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,503
Tracy can read, right?

126
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:41,131
What? Are you serious?

127
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,590
The guy's done dozens of movies.

128
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,882
Yeah, but it's not like his movies seem
like he's reading a script.

129
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,300
Let's go rescue Karen
or whatever.

130
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:51,311
Is there a Cheryl?

131
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,603
Then she could tell us where drugs are--
I mean gold--

132
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:58,850
Then we got the car chase.
I'm getting way too old for this!

133
00:05:59,028 --> 00:06:01,062
Was I supposed to say that then?

134
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:01,941
That's true.

135
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:03,941
And he never reads
the cue cards...

136
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:07,282
God, I thought all that stuff was just crazy Tracy seeing
what he could get away with.

137
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:09,241
I know, but, you know,
it's not surprising.

138
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:10,990
Look at the educational system
in this country.

139
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:13,121
We spend all this money in Iraq,
but meanwhile,

140
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:17,371
our inner-city graduation rates
are lower than they are in the Sudan.

141
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,791
That  doesn't sound right.

142
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:23,462
Maybe it was Sweden.
Maybe it was teen pregnancy.

143
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:26,720
I gotta read more.

144
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,055
What can I do for you?

145
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,649
So we wrote a product integration sketch.

146
00:06:33,818 --> 00:06:35,858
Good. But we wanted to run it
by you first

147
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,642
because it's about
how GE is making us do this.

148
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:45,191
And we were kinda hoping that the GE executive
in the sketch could be played by...you.

149
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,150
Oh, I get it--

150
00:06:47,328 --> 00:06:48,782
The whole self-referential thing:

151
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,662
Letterman hates the suits,
Stern yells at his boss,

152
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:54,082
Nixon's "sock it to me"
on Laugh-In.

153
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,453
Yeah.

154
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,201
Hippy humor.

155
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,662
That's what I'm going for.

156
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,293
Well, as you know,
I've been studying comedy

157
00:07:00,466 --> 00:07:01,503
and learning what's funny.

158
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:04,210
I'm watching Friends right now.
What happens with Ross and Rachel?

159
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:06,960
No, no. Don't tell me.
Seriously. What were you saying?

160
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:08,380
So will you do it?

161
00:07:08,556 --> 00:07:09,763
I don't know, Lemon.
I'm not an actor.

162
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:11,470
This is your world.

163
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:12,851
Oh, come on.
You can do this.

164
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:13,891
You were great in that video.

165
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:14,851
Yeah!

166
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,563
This is live television.

167
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:22,231
I've never done anything
like that before.

168
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:25,273
Okay, I'll do it.

169
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:27,320
Ohh! Great, great.
Thanks, Jack.

170
00:07:27,485 --> 00:07:29,240
So rehearsal will be
tomorrow at 2:00.

171
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:30,360
Please don't be late.

172
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:34,490
And I will fax you
any changes by 9:00 a.m.

173
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:35,660
You're such a Monica!

174
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:38,751
Ah ha!
You are.

175
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,343
Uhh.

176
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:54,051
He never reads anything.

177
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,681
Uh, why is Jack Donaghy
on the cast list?

178
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:58,313
Oh, he's gonna do
this GE sketch.

179
00:07:58,475 --> 00:07:59,271
It's really funny.

180
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,562
Oh, so he gets to be in sketches,
but he's gonna fire one of the real actors?

181
00:08:02,736 --> 00:08:03,232
What?

182
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:07,362
I got inside information that Jack is gonna fire
one of the actors to cut costs.

183
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:08,691
No. I haven't heard anything like that.

184
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,440
Don't worry about it.

185
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:11,030
Oh, I'm not worried...

186
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,362
Because I have something
the other actors don't.

187
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:14,952
A secret weapon.

188
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:17,243
Oh, don't say your sexuality.

189
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,702
My sexuality!

190
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:22,123
Oh, God, Jenna,
when has that ever worked?

191
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,333
Uh, when has it not worked?

192
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:26,132
It'll be a 45-minute wait.

193
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:29,002
Oh, will it?

194
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:31,472
Uh, yeah.

195
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:33,591
Yeah. Yeah, it will.

196
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:37,393
Yeah, but this is different
because I know Jack Donaghy.

197
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:39,013
I know what he likes.

198
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:45,522
Yeah, so now you just have to make yourself
ten years younger and Asian.

199
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,360
I don't know
what to tell you.

200
00:08:47,525 --> 00:08:49,982
They're making me rehearse.

201
00:08:50,157 --> 00:08:53,612
I know Pat Benatar
rarely performs live.

202
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:56,992
Scalp the damn tickets.

203
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,160
These are the changes
for the sketches that you're in.

204
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:03,413
Cool. I'll read those later, Lemon.

205
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:08,712
Tray...
Can you read?

206
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:11,301
Can I read?

207
00:09:11,465 --> 00:09:12,463
Please don't get angry.

208
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,341
It's not your fault.
It's the system.

209
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,053
Did you ever see
Hoop Dreams?

210
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,052
It's like that.

211
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,353
So you're asking me
if I'm illiterate?

212
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,102
You  don't even have to answer me
if you don't want to.

213
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:25,192
Just know that if you need a tutor,
we will get you a tutor.

214
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:28,311
If you need to be in fewer sketches
until you get more confident,

215
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,861
we'll accommodate you,
whatever you need.

216
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:34,400
So I could, like,
leave work early if I need a tutor?

217
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:37,241
Absolutely.
We'll work around your schedule.

218
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:40,163
I can't read,
Liz Lemon!

219
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,951
My shameful secret is out.

220
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:46,833
Now you know why I'm always running
into the ladies' bathroom.

221
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,003
I can't read!

222
00:09:49,175 --> 00:09:52,423
I sign my name with an X!

223
00:09:52,598 --> 00:09:56,930
I once tried to make mashed potatoes
with laundry detergent!

224
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,850
I think
I voted for Nader!

225
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,391
Nader!

226
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:06,063
I feel as though a great weight
has been lifted off of me, Liz Lemon.

227
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,901
Today is the first day
of the rest of my life.

228
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,610
All thanks to one very,
very special white lady.

229
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:16,282
I'll be in late tomorrow.

230
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:27,211
Damn, George Will just gets more
and more conservative.

231
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:32,131
Liz?

232
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:33,712
Hi. Did you tell Jack
he can be on the show?

233
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,552
Yeah, he was kind of
excited about it, actually.

234
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:36,840
Oh, yeah,
he's very excited.

235
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,973
But you cannot put him on live TV.

236
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:39,933
Why?

237
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,553
Okay.

238
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:47,270
I'm only showing you this
because I care about him so much.

239
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:50,940
GE Promo.

240
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:54,113
Take one.
Action!

241
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,113
- Did you say, "Action"?
- Yes. Action!

242
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,243
- Could you say it louder, please?
- I'm sorry.

243
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,363
Action!

244
00:10:58,538 --> 00:10:59,660
GE Promo.
Take two.

245
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:03,033
Hello.
For over a hundred years--

246
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:03,953
Line?

247
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,540
Sorry.
My bad.

248
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:06,791
What's the first line?

249
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,252
Product integration!

250
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,713
Okay. 

251
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,130
Right, got it.
I just need the first word.

252
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:15,750
Product!

253
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,420
What's the second word?

254
00:11:17,598 --> 00:11:18,340
Integration.

255
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:19,801
Okay, I knew that.
Okay, d-d-uh...

256
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:21,681
If I ask for the line again,
don't tell me.

257
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,720
Line?

258
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:25,473
- Line?
- Product integration.

259
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,101
I  told you don't give me the line
when I ask for the line.

260
00:11:28,278 --> 00:11:30,271
I got it.
I got it.

261
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:31,233
Could we get a do-over there?

262
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:32,601
Let's go again, can we?

263
00:11:32,806 --> 00:11:34,233
What?

264
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,691
What is it?

265
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:36,483
I don't like this at all.

266
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:38,690
Okay, I got it.
Let's go again.

267
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,743
The pen doesn't really write.
Does that matter?

268
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,121
And I'm here today--

269
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,241
My bad.
I'm sorry.

270
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,951
Oh...God.

271
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,663
Why don't we go to lunch
and we'll come back and maybe--

272
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:51,172
Let's all go have lunch.

273
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:53,002
GE Promo.
126.

274
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:54,541
It's weird.
What do I do with my arms?

275
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:55,961
I've never thought
about that before.

276
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:58,800
Is it this?

277
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:02,970
Or, if I may, this?

278
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,262
Maybe I should just hold something.

279
00:12:07,438 --> 00:12:08,771
OK, yeah, this feels more natural.

280
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:10,311
Is that right? Yeah.

281
00:12:10,486 --> 00:12:12,941
"New synergy"--
does that sound odd to anyone else?

282
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:15,020
Does that sound like
"news energy"?

283
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:16,613
And this satisfies--

284
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,532
Oh. Ouch, ouch.

285
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,530
You all right?

286
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,200
Could I get a little, uh...

287
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:26,161
I'm here to talk to you television
about the monetizing of today broadcast.

288
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,452
Was any of that usable?

289
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,291
GE Promo. 129.

290
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:31,332
It's called,
"racial integration"--

291
00:12:31,505 --> 00:12:32,500
No, that's not right, is it?

292
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,832
It's called,
"product intergort"--
"intergortian"?

293
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:38,551
...the way we monetize broadcast television.

294
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,381
How does it work?

295
00:12:40,557 --> 00:12:42,262
Oh!

296
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:45,803
Could we turn off
the phones, please?

297
00:12:45,976 --> 00:12:48,010
Oh, I'm sorr--ha!
I'm sorry. That's me.

298
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,852
Let me turn this thing off here.

299
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,102
I think I just took a picture.

300
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,983
I'm sorry, everybody,
there's a [bleep] pigeon.

301
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:56,440
Shoo!

302
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:59,863
...purchases,
and is satisfied with--Oh.

303
00:13:00,035 --> 00:13:00,903
142.

304
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:04,323
...in upward revenue
stream dynamics.

305
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:05,780
For all of us.

306
00:13:05,956 --> 00:13:07,662
Cut.
That's a wrap.

307
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:10,081
Ha! That was fun,
you guys.

308
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:11,750
Didn't feel like
five days, did it?

309
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:12,872
No. Nah, that wasn't bad.

310
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:14,211
Everybody have a good weekend.

311
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:18,000
And... we'll be right back.

312
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,050
/Jenna to the stage, please.

313
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,510
Jenna to the stage
for Muffin Top.

314
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:23,760
Hey, Liz?

315
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,883
Liz...

316
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,511
I'm a little bit nervous
about this rehearsal.

317
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:28,933
Oh, I'm glad
you brought that up.

318
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:30,220
You know, you don't have to do this.

319
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:31,392
I know how busy you are.

320
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:32,851
Oh, no, I have to do it.

321
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,521
It's a new challenge,
and I like challenges.

322
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,020
I've summited Kilimanjaro.

323
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:38,902
I've showered
with Greta Van Susteren.

324
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,111
I--I'm gonna do this, yeah.

325
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,231
The time, sir.

326
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:43,401
Oh, that's right.
Do you mind?

327
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:44,703
We'll do it around the corner, okay?

328
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,952
I'll be with you in a minute.

329
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,162
I have a conference
with my corporate division head.

330
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,950
Oh, yeah?
Are you guys gonna...

331
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:54,961
...correlate overseas
earnings report dynamics?

332
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,883
Yes.

333
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:02,093
Liz?

334
00:14:02,256 --> 00:14:03,092
Did I just hear Jack?

335
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,421
Oh, no, no, no.
Please.

336
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,093
I know for a fact he is talking
to his boss right now.

337
00:14:07,267 --> 00:14:07,932
Really?

338
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,803
Don't bother him.

339
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:11,432
Fine.

340
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,972
Don't.

341
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:18,273
Of course, sir.

342
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:19,311
I'll look into it
right away.

343
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,272
Actions speak louder than words.
Take care of it.

344
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,483
Don't worry, I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

345
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,281
Look, I am tired of your promises!
I want this thing fixed.

346
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:30,702
I'm-- I'm on it, sir.

347
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,832
So...

348
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,463
You're Jack's boss, huh?

349
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:44,512
Oh, well, yeah,
that's what they tell me.

350
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:46,260
I'm Jenna, by the way.

351
00:14:46,425 --> 00:14:50,183
Oh, I, uh,
I know who you are.

352
00:14:50,346 --> 00:14:51,263
I'm Ron.

353
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:53,892
Oh, Ron.

354
00:14:54,646 --> 00:14:56,522
How do you take
your coffee, Ron?

355
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:57,352
I take it? Uh...

356
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:01,693
I--I take it, uh,
with the non-dairy creamer.

357
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,613
Mmm. Yeah.
Non-dairy creamer.

358
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:10,031
Yum.

359
00:15:18,215 --> 00:15:18,872
Ahem.

360
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:21,331
Ahem.

361
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:22,583
Mmm.

362
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,292
Ahh.

363
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:24,672
Oh, yeah.

364
00:15:24,847 --> 00:15:25,503
Eh-heh. Wow.

365
00:15:25,677 --> 00:15:26,342
Quiet, please!

366
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:27,552
Rehearsing!

367
00:15:27,716 --> 00:15:29,510
From Mr. Donaghy's entrance.

368
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:31,762
What's up, Mr. Donaghy?

369
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:34,642
That's Josh's line.
Your lines are in blue.

370
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:35,931
My bad.
I'm sorry.

371
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,391
Those cards are
a little confusing.

372
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,100
Hello, everyone.

373
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:43,481
Thanks for waiting,
please. Sit...down.

374
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:45,441
Okay, that's great.
Just one thing, sir.

375
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,323
You're looking into the camera
a little bit.

376
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:48,823
No, I'm not.

377
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:51,821
I want to,
but I'm not. No.

378
00:15:51,995 --> 00:15:54,742
Could I get
two coffee cups?

379
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,292
Yeah, you know,
let's take five minutes,

380
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,712
actually, uh, everybody, 
while we get Mr. Donaghy some coffee cups.

381
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,332
I know you want to do this,
but I don't think it's working out.

382
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,000
I agree. It's the writing.
It's not natural.

383
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:05,421
Uhh! Really?

384
00:16:05,596 --> 00:16:06,591
You think the problem is the writing?

385
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:07,672
Yeah. It's clunky.

386
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:11,633
Wow. Well, I was really trying to help you out of this,
but, you know what? You're the boss.

387
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,010
I think I can do it.

388
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:14,473
No.  You should definitely do it.

389
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:15,601
It'll be hilarious.

390
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:19,271
Oh, well, that'd be a refreshing change
of pace for the show, wouldn't it?

391
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,023
Excuse me.

392
00:16:28,285 --> 00:16:30,193
Why would Tracy
pretend to be illiterate?

393
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,403
To get out of coming to work.

394
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:34,033
Oh, so first you thought he was illiterate,
and now you think he's lazy?

395
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:36,781
Jeez, you are racist.

396
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:41,543
No. Tracy took advantage of my white guilt,
which is to be used only for good,

397
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:46,461
like over-tipping
and supporting Barack Obama.

398
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,590
Summon.

399
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,550
Hey, Tray.

400
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,680
Kenneth told me
you finally got in to work.

401
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,511
Yeah, I had to go to reading class.

402
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:58,723
You hear this mess
about sometimes Y being a vowel?

403
00:16:58,897 --> 00:16:59,931
What a world.

404
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:00,313
Ah...

405
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:03,601
Well, we just wanted to show you
the new posters for the show.

406
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:07,112
Yeah, all right. Cool.

407
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:15,320
So it's okay to hang these
all over the city?

408
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:17,623
Yeah.
It's good.

409
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,542
I like it.

410
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,203
Really?

411
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,793
Really.

412
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:29,710
I'll be leaving early today.

413
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:37,643
/Jenna and Ghostface Killah,
/to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.

414
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:47,521
Hello?

415
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,402
Jack?
It's 3:00 in the morning.

416
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:53,361
What's wrong?

417
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:06,500
That's quite a commitment
to such terrible writing.

418
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,843
Lemon, I don't know
how to do this.

419
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:12,420
I know.

420
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,182
I don't get it.
It's not the fear.

421
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:18,803
I thrive on fear.

422
00:18:18,976 --> 00:18:21,511
You're looking out a fake window
right now, by the way.

423
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:23,391
I bow-hunt polar bear.

424
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:26,233
I once drove a rental car into the Hudson
just to practice escaping.

425
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,773
And it's not the public speaking.

426
00:18:27,946 --> 00:18:32,402
There's just something about performing
that I can't wrap my brain around.

427
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,533
All this creative crap.

428
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:35,530
Acting!

429
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,150
oh...

430
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:40,160
I've never been able to do it.

431
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,201
Never.

432
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,623
Grains and cereals
are an important--

433
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:45,621
Oh!

434
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:46,412
Line!

435
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:50,000
Damn it!
Son of a bitch!

436
00:18:50,175 --> 00:18:51,422
Lemon.

437
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:53,460
I need your help.

438
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,961
Really...
Jack Donaghy needs my--

439
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:56,921
Don't gloat.

440
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:59,430
It makes you seem mannish.

441
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:00,183
Okay.

442
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:02,141
Look, this is not your fault.

443
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,352
This whole thing was a bad idea.

444
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,061
We should just have Josh do it,
and we'll just tell everyone
you're on a business trip.

445
00:19:06,236 --> 00:19:07,350
That's not an option.
I have to do it.

446
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,103
Once I set my mind to something,
I have to accomplish it.

447
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:11,611
Ten years ago, I was an inch-and-a-half
shorter than I am today.

448
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,862
Sheer willpower.

449
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:17,153
If I don't figure this thing out by Friday,
then failure wins, and that's not acceptable.

450
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:18,820
Oh, God, the room is spinning.

451
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:20,361
What do you want from me?

452
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm one of your actors.
I'm freaking out.

453
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,492
Talk me down.

454
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,000
Okay, here's your pep talk.

455
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,333
You're not an actor.
You're Jack Donaghy, all right?

456
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:31,580
So quit whining and nut up.

457
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,750
You're right,
if you can't do this,
you are a failure.

458
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:36,672
Josh can do this, and earlier today,
he ate a club sandwich

459
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:38,343
with the toothpicks still in it.

460
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,472
Jenna can do this,
and she was once engaged to David Blaine.

461
00:19:42,647 --> 00:19:48,061
Any dumb-dumb can act, Jack,
so be a man and get it done.

462
00:19:54,236 --> 00:20:00,451
If you were any other woman on earth...
I would be turned on right now.

463
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,862
Go home.

464
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:04,951
Get some sleep.

465
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:12,543
This stays between us,
right, Lemon?

466
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:15,381
Lemon?

467
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,380
Lemon?

468
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,973
Lemon?

469
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,403
Well, I don't think I have to worry
about my job anymore.

470
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,981
And I didn't bother Jack at all.

471
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,060
Oh, good for you.

472
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,690
That's right.
I took your advice.

473
00:20:37,865 --> 00:20:41,403
I hooked up with his boss.

474
00:20:42,286 --> 00:20:43,863
- Who, Ron?
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:46,833
That guy's an extra on the show.

476
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,990
No. He said he was Jack's boss.

477
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,922
No. In the sketch.
He doesn't even have a line.

478
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,211
He doesn't have lines?

479
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,543
Don't eat in costume!

480
00:20:56,718 --> 00:21:00,341
Give me a break. I'm just--

481
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,930
But he was yelling at Jack.

482
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,012
Actions speak louder than words.
Take care of it.

483
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,102
Don't worry, sir,
I'll have it on your desk
first thing in the morning.

484
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,851
I am tired of your promises.
I just want this thing fixed now!

485
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,942
I'm on it, sir.

486
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:21,993
What is the point of belonging to the Extras Guild
if I cannot get health coverage for my foot, hmm?

487
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,153
Ew.

488
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:24,912
Oh, God, Jenna.

489
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,071
I told you,
don't listen to rumors.

490
00:21:27,248 --> 00:21:28,582
But Frank and Toofer said to me--

491
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,371
Frank and Toofer?
That's where you're getting your information?

492
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:32,872
They're messing with you!

493
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,543
No. They wouldn't do that to me.

494
00:21:34,717 --> 00:21:35,711
Yeah, they would.

495
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:38,040
Oh!

496
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:43,303
I am gonna get back at them...
using my sexuality.

497
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:48,352
Do you have any left?

498
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:55,143
/Jenna, Ghostface Killah, and Yo-Yo Ma
/to the stage, please, for Muffin Top.

499
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:01,692
- Where the hot lesbians at, Lemon?
- I knew it!

500
00:22:01,865 --> 00:22:03,111
You can read!

501
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:03,651
Fine.

502
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,070
Yes, I'm literate!

503
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:08,073
I even have a column
in Ebony called Musings!

504
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:09,621
You are unbelievable.

505
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:10,783
I'm unbelievable?

506
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:14,000
What about your racist mess?
Thinking a grown man is illiterate.

507
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,583
That's the subtle racism
of lowered expectations.

508
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:18,923
Bing Crosby said that.

509
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:21,382
No, Bill Cosby said that.

510
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:22,710
That's racist.

511
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:27,181
Look, we can all agree
Liz is generally pretty racist.

512
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:30,261
The point is, you have people
counting on you.

513
00:22:30,438 --> 00:22:32,513
You can't be finding excuses
not to be here.

514
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,982
But this job is hard!

515
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,521
I just want to be able
to do what I want to do.

516
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:41,021
You know, I once shot a whole movie
without ever getting out of my car?

517
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:44,482
Yeah, I paid to see that.
That was supposed to be a western.

518
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:46,781
You're not a big shot
movie star anymore, Tray.

519
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,533
You're the star of TGS,
and you will read the lines as written,

520
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,411
starting tonight
because this show is important.

521
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:55,080
I set a very high standard
for myself,

522
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:58,121
and I expect the same
of the professionals who work with me.

523
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,420
When Gaybraham Lincoln gets hit in the crotch,
can I go cross-eyed?

524
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,672
Oh, yes, do that.
That's hilarious!

525
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:12,222
Hey have you seen
Frank or Toofer?

526
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:14,310
Pete!

527
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,812
The standards lady is saying
that my moaning in Muffin Top is too graphic.

528
00:23:17,988 --> 00:23:19,440
Which of these is less offensive?

529
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,732
Ahh! Ahh!

530
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:22,862
Ahhh!

531
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:23,771
Or...

532
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,360
Ooh-hunh!

533
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,823
Unh-hunh!

534
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:28,110
Ohhh!

535
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:29,661
Both sound good to me.

536
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:32,492
Hello, Ron.

537
00:23:34,126 --> 00:23:37,292
I would just hate
for Muffin Top to get cut
because of a standards problem.

538
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,331
I've already posted it
on my weblog though
I'll be doing it.

539
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:40,461
Jenna, we're not gonna cut it.

540
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:41,330
Are you messing with me?

541
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,091
Because people around here
keep messing with me.

542
00:23:43,258 --> 00:23:44,712
I'm not messing with you.

543
00:23:44,888 --> 00:23:47,172
So which one? Ahh!

544
00:23:47,347 --> 00:23:48,422
Or, ohhh!

545
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,641
Uh, I guess...
Uh, "ahh ahh! Ahh."

546
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:57,561
Oh, Hey. Look,
it's no big deal,

547
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,601
but we had to make some changes
in your sketch, okay?

548
00:23:59,777 --> 00:24:01,140
I have new pages for you.

549
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:01,692
You do?

550
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:04,362
Yeah. Tracy is now in it now,
so we had to change some of the cues.

551
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,820
Also, the opening VT is cut,
so you just go right out, okay?

552
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:10,242
Oh, and, um, you all say
the last line together.

553
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:11,451
Wow. So, uh...

554
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,781
So you're gonna be great.
Have fun.

555
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:17,950
Lemon, these pages are blank.

556
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:19,042
Oh.

557
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,003
Never mind.

558
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,291
Withdrawn.

559
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:25,961
And, remember,
don't look into the camera!

560
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:30,550
Toofer?

561
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:31,183
Yeah?

562
00:24:31,347 --> 00:24:32,262
Can I tell you a secret?

563
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:32,971
Sure.

564
00:24:33,146 --> 00:24:36,720
We've been working together a while,
and I know this may sound crazy,

565
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:39,022
but I've been watching you.

566
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:44,861
I have this fantasy of sneaking up to the roof of 30 Rock,
and we make love while looking out at the city --

567
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,192
Okay, let me guess.

568
00:24:46,365 --> 00:24:52,992
You figured out Frank and I lied to you, so to get even,
you're trying to get me naked on the roof and leave me there.

569
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,701
Nice try.

570
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,620
Where's Frank?

571
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:02,081
But we're cool,
right, Mr. Donaghy?

572
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:05,500
No, you're all fired.

573
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:15,141
No, you're all fired.

574
00:25:18,396 --> 00:25:20,180
Hey, good job the other night.

575
00:25:20,357 --> 00:25:22,520
Oh, you mean on the show?
Thanks.

576
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,230
What were you watching?

577
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:26,271
Nothing. Uh...

578
00:25:26,447 --> 00:25:27,691
Bloomberg.

579
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:30,110
Hmm.

580
00:25:31,785 --> 00:25:32,902
Aha!

581
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:37,820
Don't be cute, Lemon.
You're too old for that.

582
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:43,043
Good God!

583
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:45,002
Lemon!

584
00:25:45,178 --> 00:25:48,040
Mr. Donaghy, open up!
Please?

585
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:50,590
Lemon!

586
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,172
* Everyone knows

587
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:54,552
* The most delicious part of the muffin *

588
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,933
* Is the top

589
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:58,141
* My muffin top

590
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:00,891
* Is all that whole grain, low-fat *

591
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,680
* I know you want a piece of that *

592
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:04,393
* But I just wanna dance *

593
00:26:04,568 --> 00:26:06,313
* Ch-checkin' out my sweet hips *

594
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:08,152
* My sugar-coated berry lips *

595
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,110
* I know you want to get with this *

596
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,941
* But I'm just here to dance *

597
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:13,530
* So back

598
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,451
* Up off of me

599
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:17,411
* You're we-ee-ee-eirding

600
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:19,073
* Me out

601
00:26:19,248 --> 00:26:21,032
* I'm an independent lady

602
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,000
* So do not try to play me *

603
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,793
* I run a tidy bakery

604
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:26,670
* The boys all want my cake for free *

605
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,541
Does she know we went off
the air two minutes ago?

606
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:32,671
- No, she does not.
- Smart move.
