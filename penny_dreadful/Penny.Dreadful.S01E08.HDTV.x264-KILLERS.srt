1
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:08,582
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

2
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:09,650
Father!

3
00:00:09,684 --> 00:00:10,918
Mina!

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:12,586
No!

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,987
We'll find her again.

6
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,522
At least you know she's alive.

7
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,990
Is that what you call it?

8
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,292
Do what you have promised me.

9
00:00:19,327 --> 00:00:21,794
You will make me an immortal mate.

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,729
My bride must be beautiful.

11
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:26,499
You're brooding, Mr. Chandler.

12
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,268
It's Miss Croft. She's not well.

13
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,137
Best you didn't kiss me anymore.

14
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:32,805
Keep a safe distance.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,407
Hold her arms still!

16
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:36,041
Miss Ives is manifesting

17
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,210
a deep psychosexual responsiveness.

18
00:00:38,244 --> 00:00:40,913
Something or someone has triggered it.

19
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:43,850
You don't know what it's like
having this thing inside me.

20
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:46,318
An animal scratching to get out.

21
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,521
You're now in a very special place.

22
00:00:48,555 --> 00:00:50,189
Mina. Find her.

23
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,992
You must. We might never
have this chance again.

24
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,494
Whatever game you think
you're playing I've had enough!

25
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:56,828
I know he doesn't want her to die,

26
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:58,864
but I'm not quite sure
why he wants her to live.

27
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,832
- She's like a daughter.
- No. She's not.

28
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:02,267
That's the problem.

29
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:04,703
There cannot be a happy end...

30
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:08,140
For claw will slash and tooth will rend.

31
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:13,745
I know where Mina is.

32
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:43,616

"for claw will slash and tooth will rend."

35
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,051
And nothing more?

36
00:03:03,086 --> 00:03:04,519
There were images I'd seen before

37
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,188
from the theater where I saw the play.

38
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,591
I believe Mina is trying to be found.

39
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,294
We know they flee when they're discovered,

40
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,063
like a pack of rats seeking a new den.

41
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:21,368
Perhaps this time we'll be lucky.

42
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,037
And if we are?

43
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,841
I left my son to suffer without me.

44
00:03:28,043 --> 00:03:30,144
I'll not do the same to my daughter.

45
00:03:31,246 --> 00:03:32,312
Meaning?

46
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:34,548
If I can save her, I will.

47
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:36,951
If I cannot,

48
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,987
I will end her suffering.

49
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,992
And will that bring you peace?

50
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:49,363
Don't be naive. It doesn't suit you.

51
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,098
I'll contact the others.

52
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,833
We'll go after the theater closes tonight.

53
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,765
There is a gentleman here to see you.

54
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,952
Show Mr. Gray in.

55
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,417
Miss Ives.

56
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,218
Mr. Gray, hello.

57
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,286
Won't you sit down?

58
00:04:59,998 --> 00:05:02,133
I'm so glad to see you've recovered.

59
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,270
I stopped by, but they
told me you were ill.

60
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:09,006
I'm quite myself.

61
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,908
Of course.

62
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:17,915
I went traveling, you know,
since I couldn't see you.

63
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:23,253
Yes, um...

64
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,324
Italy at first.

65
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:30,594
Bought some manuscripts.

66
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:34,865
Welcome back.

67
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:40,003
Will you read my future?

68
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:42,072
I don't know that you have one.

69
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,473
Everyone has a future.

70
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:45,275
Not everyone.

71
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,844
Some people only have a past.

72
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,745
Then read my past.

73
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,849
Then you would have no more mystery.

74
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,351
Let me take you to lunch, at least.

75
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:56,419
I'm engaged today.

76
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:57,820
Then dinner, better yet. There's a new...

77
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,656
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

78
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,056
I would like to talk to you.

79
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:03,392
- If you'll excuse me...
- Miss Ives.

80
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:08,597
At 4:00 today

81
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:11,633
I'll be waiting at Rothschild's Slipper.

82
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:13,836
- Please...
- Good morning, Mr. Gray.

83
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,770
Sembene can show you out.

84
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,273
We ought to just take him.

85
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,143
Not here.

86
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:33,312
Have patience, Mr. Kidd.

87
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,615
Enjoy the hunt.

88
00:07:40,153 --> 00:07:43,272
This winter never ends
in this fucking country.

89
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:27,965
If you'll come this way, sir.

90
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,957
It's a prototype,

91
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,858
acquired by something less

92
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:57,760
than our usual standards
of professional etiquette.

93
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,597
It has something new.

94
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:02,933
Automatic firing mechanism.

95
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:15,745
7.63 by 25 millimeter cartridges.

96
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,048
Highest velocity pistol
shells in the world.

97
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,951
Stop an elephant.

98
00:09:20,985 --> 00:09:22,618
I'll take it.

99
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,224
Sir Malcolm.

100
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,095
Ma'am.

101
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,832
Wait a minute, Kali, is
it not? From the seance?

102
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,335
It's actually Evelyn Paul, from Brighton.

103
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,538
- Preferable.
- Yes.

104
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:45,541
But the clients do so
enjoy the legerdemain.

105
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:48,611
Who doesn't? Are you
interested in firearms?

106
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:50,846
My late husband was.

107
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:55,417
I suppose I'm sentimental
about the smell of gun oil.

108
00:09:55,451 --> 00:09:58,720
And a woman alone in a
city needs protection,

109
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,222
doesn't she?

110
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:03,291
I sense you're more than capable of
looking after yourself, Mrs. Paul.

111
00:10:03,326 --> 00:10:05,593
Oh, Evelyn, please.

112
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,369
You're planning another expedition, I read.

113
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:15,537
Yes.

114
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:16,838
How long will you be gone?

115
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:19,340
Matter of a year, perhaps two.

116
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,443
What a shame.

117
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:24,745
And us just getting reacquainted.

118
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,384
So how's your friend? Miss Ives?

119
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:32,853
A friend of my daughter.

120
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:35,221
Couldn't rightly say.
I don't see much of her.

121
00:10:35,757 --> 00:10:37,824
Who do you see much of?

122
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,560
Tired old explorers like myself.

123
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:46,400
Well, I must run.

124
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:49,402
This has been a pleasure, Evelyn.

125
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:52,405
Not so memorable as our first encounter.

126
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,374
I wouldn't say that.

127
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,910
I hope we shall meet again.

128
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,544
I'm sure of it.

129
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,746
Good day.

130
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,157
Die, die, die.

131
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:12,692
Line, line, line.

132
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,794
Watch your marks here, darling.

133
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:17,330
And...

134
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:20,299
Which of us is bound for heaven or hell?

135
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,335
Now comes the moment when we shall tell.

136
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:39,117
Oh, for Christ's sake.

137
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,253
The other line!

138
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,321
Release the other line.

139
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:44,256
Get me down.

140
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,691
Just bring him down.

141
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,093
I'm not doing this
again. To hell with this.

142
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:50,195
Calm down.

143
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,530
What's the problem?

144
00:11:51,564 --> 00:11:52,731
Sorry, Vincent.

145
00:11:52,765 --> 00:11:54,499
If he can't get the fucking pulls right...

146
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,566
Simon, stop it.

147
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,135
Look, would you get me out of this thing?

148
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,402
Mr. Gregor, please!

149
00:11:58,437 --> 00:12:00,605
I'm not going up until you get this sorted.

150
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
Now, he's a menace.

151
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,141
Sorry, Simon. It won't happen again.

152
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:05,576
Don't come near me.

153
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,612
God, I can't bear the bloody sight of you.

154
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,481
And neither can anyone else, I might add.

155
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:16,020
When you get your monster
to behave, we'll be back.

156
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,356
Maud, come.

157
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:21,625
Maud!

158
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,467
I'm sorry, Vincent.

159
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,769
No, pet.

160
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,738
Show business. All bitches.

161
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:17,913
Hello.

162
00:13:18,815 --> 00:13:20,282
Maud.

163
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:25,654
I brought you an orange.

164
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,493
Thank you.

165
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:34,963
Everyone likes oranges, I reckon.

166
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:37,299
Yes.

167
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,635
Thank you.

168
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,810
Reading again?

169
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,845
Yes.

170
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,398
Thank you for the book.

171
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:57,051
Paradise Lost.

172
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:58,820
That was sweet.

173
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:00,855
Are you reading it?

174
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,625
Well, it's awfully long.

175
00:14:05,193 --> 00:14:06,760
You've read it?

176
00:14:07,495 --> 00:14:08,762
Yes.

177
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:13,200
There are...

178
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:17,037
There are lines that speak to me.

179
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:21,642
"O fleeting joys

180
00:14:21,676 --> 00:14:23,577
"Of Paradise, dear

181
00:14:25,346 --> 00:14:27,714
"Bought with lasting woes!

182
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:33,352
"Did I request thee, Maker

183
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:37,257
"Out of my clay

184
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,559
"To mould me Man?"

185
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:50,203
I'm sorry about Simon today.

186
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:53,739
He's a beast sometimes,

187
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,274
but he doesn't really mean it.

188
00:14:55,309 --> 00:14:56,959
Yes, he does.

189
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,716
He makes you happy?

190
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,367
In a way.

191
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,321
I suppose we take the happiness we can.

192
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:11,856
Do you?

193
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,162
I believe that lot is for others.

194
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:23,735
What a sad thing to say.

195
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,608
You don't have to hide your face from me.

196
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:39,183
I'll see you later, then.

197
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:27,864
May I speak with you?

198
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:28,965
Yes.

199
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,934
You have not been honest with me.

200
00:16:30,968 --> 00:16:33,136
What do you want, Vanessa?

201
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,237
It's gone.

202
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,539
What?

203
00:16:36,573 --> 00:16:38,741
The photograph of Mina and Peter.

204
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,242
Yes, it is.

205
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,380
Why did you not want me on the ship?

206
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,818
I was trying to protect you.

207
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:51,185
I don't believe you.

208
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,122
Believe what you like.

209
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:55,824
What haven't you told me?

210
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:00,129
Nothing I would say
would come as a surprise.

211
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:03,332
So you simply want the
satisfaction of hearing me say it.

212
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:06,735
Very well.

213
00:17:10,406 --> 00:17:13,608
I would sacrifice you to save my daughter.

214
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:15,644
I would choose her over you.

215
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:18,447
I might even hope I get the chance.

216
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:21,316
But until then, you are invaluable to me.

217
00:17:21,684 --> 00:17:24,852
Your connection to Mina is my lifeline,

218
00:17:24,886 --> 00:17:27,721
so I must keep you alive.

219
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:31,759
I put the photograph in the
drawer because I couldn't bear it.

220
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:34,762
It broke my heart.

221
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,433
Not a young girl's heart, Vanessa.

222
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,433
A man's heart.

223
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:45,038
You must handle your guilt on your own.

224
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:47,107
I'll not help you.

225
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:49,042
Neither of us is free from guilt.

226
00:17:49,077 --> 00:17:51,378
Yes, but you want to be.

227
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:53,981
That's the difference between us.

228
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,684
Then you should put the picture back.

229
00:17:57,718 --> 00:17:59,986
Let it break your heart.

230
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:07,519
What have you done to yourself?

231
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,954
I, um...

232
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:14,258
I brought an orange.

233
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:17,562
You really shouldn't come in here.

234
00:19:17,596 --> 00:19:19,479
Simon comes in here.

235
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,834
How do you know what Simon does?

236
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,836
I...

237
00:19:26,738 --> 00:19:28,188
I'm sorry...

238
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:31,008
Will you have the orange with me?

239
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,543
Please get out.

240
00:19:32,578 --> 00:19:34,045
Clean that nonsense off your face.

241
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,845
Please? Please?

242
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:02,405
I'm sorry for this.

243
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:05,274
Ridiculous theatricals, are we not?

244
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,311
Nothing to be done.

245
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,948
We are mortals all,
extravagant in our weakness.

246
00:20:15,352 --> 00:20:19,255
Given half a chance, I'd
keep you and sack her,

247
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:22,125
but the public demands the ingenue.

248
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,727
I am a slave to the public.

249
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,864
Thank you for your kindness, Vincent.

250
00:20:30,433 --> 00:20:32,534
I've not known much of it.

251
00:20:45,381 --> 00:20:47,816
Remember us better than we are.

252
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,494
Mr. Gray.

253
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:12,664
Thank you for coming, Miss Ives.

254
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:17,302
May I call you Vanessa?

255
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,638
Of course.

256
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,411
The bloom is fading.

257
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes.

258
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,184
Another 15 years, and it will flower again.

259
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,586
A lifetime.

260
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,655
An instant.

261
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:43,694
Will you walk with me?

262
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,884
Do you feel I owe you an explanation?

263
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:08,351
For what?

264
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,920
My sudden flight from your house.

265
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:13,840
You owe me nothing but
your company this afternoon.

266
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:16,493
Yes, that's your way.

267
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,028
The pleasant neutrality that risks nothing.

268
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,664
Then allow me to risk everything.

269
00:23:20,698 --> 00:23:22,565
Mr. Gray,

270
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,034
I am not the woman you think I am.

271
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:27,403
And with you,

272
00:23:28,205 --> 00:23:31,207
I am not the woman I want to be.

273
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,410
It's too dangerous.

274
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:35,477
I have no fear.

275
00:23:35,512 --> 00:23:37,279
But I must.

276
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:44,085
Between us there's a rare
connection, I won't deny it.

277
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,455
But that very intimacy

278
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,556
released something...

279
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,960
unhealthy in me,

280
00:23:51,994 --> 00:23:54,830
something I cannot allow.

281
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:56,131
You will not be able to deny it.

282
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm sorry, I will.

283
00:24:02,171 --> 00:24:03,939
Poor Dorian.

284
00:24:03,973 --> 00:24:06,708
You've never known this
feeling before, have you?

285
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:10,362
I don't know what I'm feeling.

286
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,359
It's rejection.

287
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,603
Goodbye, Mr. Gray.

288
00:25:10,938 --> 00:25:12,405
Well, you can't stay here.

289
00:25:12,439 --> 00:25:13,606
I've no intention to.

290
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,673
Then why did you come?

291
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:16,475
Because I've nowhere else.

292
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,646
No, I have no one else.

293
00:25:23,717 --> 00:25:26,651
Is that not the saddest of all, creator?

294
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:30,855
I'm again cast on your barren shores.

295
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:37,897
My heart is not large enough to forgive you

296
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:40,232
for the murder of Professor Van Helsing,

297
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:46,104
nor for this monstrous thing
you have demanded of me.

298
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,543
And a futile thing, too.

299
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,766
Futile.

300
00:26:00,786 --> 00:26:02,653
All futile.

301
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:12,979
What dreams I had of my mate.

302
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:19,070
Of another being, looking into these eyes,

303
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:22,573
upon this face, and recoiling not.

304
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:27,844
But how could that happen?

305
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:32,348
For the monster is not in my face,

306
00:26:33,952 --> 00:26:35,785
but in my soul.

307
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:42,459
I once thought that

308
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:45,495
if I was like other men, I would be happy

309
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,897
and loved.

310
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,734
The malignance has grown, you see,

311
00:26:52,503 --> 00:26:54,804
from the outside in.

312
00:26:57,608 --> 00:27:03,212
And this shattered visage merely reflects

313
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:07,483
the abomination that is my heart.

314
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,158
Oh, my creator, why...

315
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:20,829
Why did you not make me of steel and stone?

316
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,332
Why did you allow me to feel?

317
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:32,208
I would rather be the corpse I was

318
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,342
than the man I am.

319
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,616
Go ahead.

320
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,120
Pull the trigger.

321
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:49,357
It would be a blessing.

322
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:27,159
Doctor?

323
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,700
Stay here.

324
00:28:49,448 --> 00:28:51,016
I need you.

325
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,109
I can give you a sedative.

326
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:24,448
It would ease things.

327
00:29:33,625 --> 00:29:35,125
You're comfortable, then?

328
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:37,994
My body?

329
00:29:39,197 --> 00:29:40,730
Yes.

330
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,266
And your spirit?

331
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:45,234
My soul?

332
00:29:46,137 --> 00:29:47,971
If you like.

333
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,375
I hated that fucker God, you see?

334
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,678
Cruel.

335
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:57,681
Cruel, he was.

336
00:30:00,484 --> 00:30:01,551
But now...

337
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:02,752
Yes?

338
00:30:02,787 --> 00:30:04,154
I'm frightened.

339
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,660
You have nothing to fear.

340
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:13,061
You're stepping through a door.

341
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,398
That is all.

342
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,500
Aye, but to where?

343
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,403
I've not been good.

344
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:25,841
Who waits for me on the
other side of the door?

345
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,454
It won't be long.

346
00:30:39,488 --> 00:30:40,655
Could you go to the end of the corridor

347
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,107
and fetch me a basin of fresh water?

348
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,377
I'll be right back.

349
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,175
I believe in a place

350
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,144
between heaven and hell,

351
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,414
between the living and the dead.

352
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,985
A glorious place of everlasting rebirth,

353
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:13,153
perhaps even salvation.

354
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:18,291
Do you believe in such a place?

355
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,502
Now, there is a...

356
00:31:29,737 --> 00:31:32,138
A price to pay for such a passage,

357
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,241
as there is with all things.

358
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:39,745
I know that you'll pay it easily.

359
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:36,867
I'm sorry, Ethan.

360
00:32:38,337 --> 00:32:39,995
It's over.

361
00:32:47,947 --> 00:32:51,115
Her passing was a thing
of grace, I promise you.

362
00:32:58,623 --> 00:33:00,825
Spend your time with her.

363
00:33:02,961 --> 00:33:05,262
And don't worry.

364
00:33:05,296 --> 00:33:07,397
I'll take care of the body.

365
00:34:06,856 --> 00:34:09,992
Beer, thanks. And one for my friend.

366
00:34:11,428 --> 00:34:13,695
This goddamn country, right?

367
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,530
What I wouldn't give for an ice chip.

368
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:17,132
Or a cherry phosphate.

369
00:34:17,166 --> 00:34:19,233
Yeah. What if?

370
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:22,603
You miss the cherry phosphates, Ethan?

371
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:26,507
Name's Warren Roper.

372
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,543
Friend here is Mr. Kidd.

373
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,912
No actual first name, so far as I know.

374
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:33,648
Of course, he was raised Chiricahua Apache

375
00:34:33,682 --> 00:34:36,216
before the Carlisle
School Americanized him,

376
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:39,453
made him the proper Christian
gent you see before you.

377
00:34:40,322 --> 00:34:42,523
What do you want?

378
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,992
Your father's eager to see you.

379
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:47,627
Don't you miss your daddy?

380
00:34:49,664 --> 00:34:50,730
Federal marshals.

381
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:54,301
Heavens, no.

382
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,903
We're in the private sector, you might say.

383
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:59,239
We're employed by the Pinkerton Agency.

384
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:00,607
We've been charged to bring you back

385
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,242
to the land of ice chips
and cherry phosphates.

386
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,413
You left some tears behind you, son.

387
00:35:07,448 --> 00:35:09,816
And a whole mess of blood.

388
00:35:09,851 --> 00:35:11,785
Whole mess.

389
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:13,769
Show him, Mr. Kidd.

390
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,032
You come along easily, now.

391
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,034
We'll smoke dime cigars and play canasta

392
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:29,235
the whole passage back.

393
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:31,303
I'll even let you win.

394
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,674
Give us any vexation,

395
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,276
and we'll drag you back like a monkey.

396
00:35:40,747 --> 00:35:44,082
Your daddy says, "Come
home," so home you come.

397
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:46,285
You can't run forever, Ethan.

398
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:51,890
I do miss the ice chips.

399
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:59,398
You won't be needing those, Mr. Kidd.

400
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:11,075
Who did that?

401
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,089
We have underestimated our prey, Mr. Kidd.

402
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:28,959
You're a damned Apache. Track him.

403
00:36:59,557 --> 00:37:02,625
Thank you for coming, Mr. Chandler.

404
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:04,427
Miss Ives.

405
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,333
I don't take tobacco.

406
00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:13,786
Neither do I.

407
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,885
I was so very sorry to
hear about Ms. Croft.

408
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:40,662
Thank you for your kindness when I was ill.

409
00:37:41,697 --> 00:37:43,665
Was it kindness, I wonder.

410
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:47,769
Let's say it was.

411
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:54,275
Good. You're here.

412
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:56,577
If Mina's inside, we
shall seize our moment,

413
00:37:56,612 --> 00:37:59,981
but under no circumstances
are you to approach her.

414
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,400
She is my responsibility.

415
00:42:57,602 --> 00:42:59,069
Help!

416
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,275
Vanessa.

417
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:49,686
Mina.

418
00:43:51,288 --> 00:43:53,056
Sweet Vanessa.

419
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,157
Mina.

420
00:43:55,192 --> 00:43:56,692
Father.

421
00:44:02,832 --> 00:44:04,133
Father.

422
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:09,738
You've brought her to me.

423
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,306
You've done well.

424
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:13,675
No, Mr. Chandler.

425
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,310
You have no role in this play.

426
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:17,079
Don't move, Ethan.

427
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:20,682
Mina, I can save you.

428
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:23,986
Why do you think I want to be saved?

429
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,620
Look at me.

430
00:44:27,023 --> 00:44:29,757
Somewhere inside, you know who you are.

431
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:33,995
Who you were meant to be.

432
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,497
I am who I was meant to be.

433
00:44:38,867 --> 00:44:41,903
You'll understand when you join the Master.

434
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:43,954
When you all join him.

435
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:47,575
And now that he has his bride,

436
00:44:48,476 --> 00:44:50,844
he'll sire generations.

437
00:44:54,115 --> 00:44:55,950
Don't do this.

438
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,685
It's already done.

439
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:05,158
I'm your daughter.

440
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:13,984
I already have a daughter.

441
00:45:54,608 --> 00:45:56,341
You were right.

442
00:45:59,245 --> 00:46:01,980
I was never going to go to Africa.

443
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,980
This room will seem empty without my gear.

444
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:15,543
We should get a Christmas
tree, should we not?

445
00:46:17,029 --> 00:46:19,864
We can have the boys come over to decorate.

446
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:40,032
Good to see you again, pal.

447
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:45,404
You ought to just come along now.

448
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,273
The fun's over.

449
00:48:49,076 --> 00:48:51,009
You think so?

450
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:57,116
You're gonna make us
chain you up like a monkey?

451
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:58,450
Mmm.

452
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,685
Got us a monkey here?

453
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:10,128
We got us a monkey here.

454
00:49:10,163 --> 00:49:11,730
Monkey?

455
00:49:12,064 --> 00:49:13,699
No.

456
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:15,367
No monkey.

457
00:51:37,005 --> 00:51:38,539
Father.

458
00:51:41,676 --> 00:51:43,611
May I speak with you?

459
00:51:51,352 --> 00:51:54,688
Do you believe in the mercy
of our Lord Jesus Christ?

460
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,057
Yes.

461
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:59,760
Do you believe our Lord forgives all?

462
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:02,353
- Yes.
- Then we've made a good start, haven't we?

463
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,733
What do you fear, girl?

464
00:52:12,873 --> 00:52:14,574
Those things

465
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:18,645
of which I am capable.

466
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,849
Of which I have proven myself capable.

467
00:52:22,883 --> 00:52:25,217
Are they really so monstrous?

468
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:32,424
Do you believe a soul can
be taken over by another?

469
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:34,760
That you can lose
yourself to something dark?

470
00:52:34,795 --> 00:52:36,661
I believe in the devil,

471
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,929
if that's what you mean.

472
00:52:37,964 --> 00:52:39,198
That's what I mean.

473
00:52:39,232 --> 00:52:41,500
I believe in curses.

474
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:44,670
I believe in demons. I believe in monsters.

475
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:46,305
Do you?

476
00:52:46,339 --> 00:52:49,274
I believe more in sicknesses
that can be treated.

477
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:51,210
But when the treatments fail.

478
00:52:51,244 --> 00:52:53,411
When science fails.

479
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:56,114
What is there then?

480
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,451
You mean exorcism?

481
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:09,027
You know, back in Wales, where I'm from,

482
00:53:10,595 --> 00:53:13,998
there was a boy who was ill.

483
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:16,401
The parish decided upon
the right of exorcism.

484
00:53:16,435 --> 00:53:19,103
They did not seek approval from Rome.

485
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:22,606
It was, uh, well, a community
event, you might say.

486
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:24,942
And I was asked to assist.

487
00:53:24,976 --> 00:53:27,544
To help that poor boy.

488
00:53:28,279 --> 00:53:29,780
What happened?

489
00:53:29,814 --> 00:53:31,248
He died.

490
00:53:33,618 --> 00:53:35,585
They all died.

491
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:39,657
Did he find God?

492
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,091
No.

493
00:53:42,126 --> 00:53:43,860
No one did.

494
00:53:46,797 --> 00:53:49,899
Before we continue our
conversation, my dear,

495
00:53:49,934 --> 00:53:53,170
there is one thing you must understand.

496
00:53:53,204 --> 00:53:55,539
Even if it can be verified,

497
00:53:55,573 --> 00:53:59,841
this is a long, grueling
and dangerous thing you ask.

498
00:54:02,546 --> 00:54:05,682
It could take months, or years,

499
00:54:05,716 --> 00:54:08,517
or always, or never.

500
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:12,789
But before we say another word,

501
00:54:12,823 --> 00:54:16,392
you must look into your heart

502
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:19,395
and you must answer me
a question. Just one.

503
00:54:22,466 --> 00:54:26,001
If you have been touched by the demon,

504
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:29,371
it's like being touched
by the back hand of God.

505
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:32,674
Makes you sacred in a way,

506
00:54:33,876 --> 00:54:35,443
doesn't it?

507
00:54:36,545 --> 00:54:38,379
Makes you unique,

508
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:41,183
with a kind of glory.

509
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:46,154

512
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:20,650
