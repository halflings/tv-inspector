1
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:15,168
# Because I love him so #

2
00:00:15,235 --> 00:00:22,713
# I'd be good
for nothing too, I know #

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,453
# Without good for nothing Joe #

4
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:47,846
# I'd be good
for nothing too, I know... #

5
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:51,715
Dr. Curan, I presume?

6
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,457
You work out of your home.

7
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:02,027
I think that's wonderful.

8
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,230
Well, I cater mostly to the
families in the neighborhood.

9
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,200
Makes it convenient
for them and for me.

10
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,401
And for your wife.

11
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:09,804
Oh, I'm not married, not currently.

12
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:11,840
Where did you say you heard of me?

13
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,042
My girlfriend Nabby Pierce?

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,511
You filled her cavity.

15
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:17,145
She said you were very good.

16
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:19,314
Nabby, yes, nice gal.

17
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,150
Nabby also said

18
00:01:22,218 --> 00:01:24,153
you sometimes made
special arrangements

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,889
with girls who were a little short.

20
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:28,523
You don't have any money?

21
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,858
Not very much.

22
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:32,660
I'm still trying to establish myself.

23
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:34,429
I'm an actress.

24
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:35,996
I'm going to make it big.

25
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:38,198
Everyone says so.

26
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:41,002
You can expect to see me up
on the silver screen one day.

27
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:45,640
Don't you think
we could come to some kind

28
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,976
of mutually beneficial arrangement,

29
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:49,578
Dr. Curan?

30
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:51,214
Well, I-I don't know.

31
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:52,916
It hurts, Doctor.

32
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:55,751
I really need you to fill it.

33
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:00,692
I'm just going to put this on you.

34
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:07,266
I don't want to crush your carnation.

35
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:10,803
It's not a carnation, silly.

36
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,238
It's a dahlia.

37
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:19,078
Just breathe.

38
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:34,726
Isn't it a beautiful day, Ava?

39
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,628
Mommy, what's that?

40
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:43,103
That's nothing, honey, it's just
a department store manne...

41
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:53,753

42
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,470
Violet's camping out in her room.

43
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,308
I was wondering if you could
make her a sandwich.

44
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:10,432
Of course, Dr. Harmon.

45
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:11,346
Thank you.

46
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:12,928
Could you help me a minute?

47
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:22,053
It must be hard on you
with your wife indisposed.

48
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,451
I miss Vivien.

49
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:25,890
We became quite close.

50
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,876
Don't worry.

51
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,079
Our secret is safe.
What secret?

52
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:33,241
The way you look at me, the
way you fantasize about me.

53
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:37,420
You have a diseased
mind, Dr. Harmon.

54
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,826
That must be why you
became a therapist.

55
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,428
I'm glad you and my wife are friends,

56
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:45,631
but I'm not interested
in your pet theories about me.

57
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,012
So maybe I'm way off base

58
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,503
or maybe I'm crazy like Vivien.

59
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:55,240
Is that what you think, Doctor?

60
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:58,009
I think you must have
pretty low self-esteem

61
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,510
to keep throwing yourself
at a married man

62
00:04:59,578 --> 00:05:01,946
who doesn't want you.

63
00:05:02,014 --> 00:05:04,016
So you don't want me?

64
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,584
You don't find me attractive?

65
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,821
Just make Violet a sandwich, please.

66
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:11,057
I don't believe you, Ben.

67
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,292
I know you want me.

68
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,429
No, I don't want this.

69
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,264
I love my wife.

70
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:18,599
I want her to get better

71
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:21,069
and come home
so I can take care of her.

72
00:05:21,137 --> 00:05:23,772
I just want a normal...

73
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,641
boring family.

74
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:31,046
That's a beautiful speech, Ben.

75
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:33,682
It's Dr. Harmon.
No more games.

76
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:37,486
No more bullshit.
Do you understand?

77
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,388
I'd better make Violet a sandwich.

78
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,861
You know, it's just
a matter of time, Ben.

79
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,197
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."

80
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Hey.

81
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:06,415
Did they all...?

82
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:07,449
Poo? Uh, yeah.

83
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:09,585
Oh, all except for that one.

84
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,653
Well, if he shits in the house

85
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,588
you're cleaning it up.

86
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:16,924
Damn, look at the mud you tracked in.

87
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,094
Nice.

88
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:25,633
You smoked the last one.

89
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,368
My daughter just died,

90
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,937
and you're on my back
about a goddamn cigarette?

91
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:32,774
Here, smoke that one, asshole.

92
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,744
I'm not another one
of your dogs. I got a job.

93
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,747
I work hard. I don't want
to come over here;

94
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:38,981
I don't want to have to work more.

95
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,517
You got a job.

96
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:44,121
Reading a script down at a call
center for two hours a day.

97
00:06:44,189 --> 00:06:45,756
Oh, my.

98
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,057
Let me rub your feet.

99
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,627
And how did those headshots
that I paid for

100
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:52,396
work out for you?

101
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,106
I'm sorry about Addie.

102
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,174
She was a cool chick.
Ugh!

103
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,912
Yeah. Maybe that's why you used
to come over here early, huh?

104
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,613
Before I got home?

105
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,984
So you could spend
a little time diddling her, huh?

106
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:18,186
Whispering sweet nothings in her ear?

107
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,387
I hate when you drink.

108
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,724
Hey!

109
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,127
What?

110
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,862
Why don't you run on down

111
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,199
to the Koreans and get us
another carton of ciggies?

112
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,534
That's where I'm going.

113
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:35,304
And take that goddamn dog with you.

114
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,906
And don't come back until he does

115
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,708
his business.

116
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,651
Come on, buddy.

117
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:53,457
That for me?

118
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,759
For the dog, actually.

119
00:07:57,595 --> 00:07:59,062
Where you headed?

120
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,930
The store.

121
00:08:00,998 --> 00:08:03,866
You want me to get you
some candy, little girl?

122
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:06,469
You're with that lady next door.

123
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:08,270
She a little old for you?

124
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,540
She seems like a royal bitch.

125
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,844
Maybe you and I should run away
together, then.

126
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:21,248
# In the cool of the evening #

127
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,017
# When everybody's getting
kind of groovy #

128
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,193
# You call me up and ask me
would I like to go... #

129
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,761
I came inside.

130
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:34,997
It's cool.

131
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,100
I can't get pregnant.

132
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,969
Really?

133
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,203
Sweet!

134
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,840
Your mom isn't gonna get pissed?

135
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:45,375
Freaking hope she does.

136
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,477
Then I'm some sweet revenge.

137
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:49,913
I'm not gonna tell her.

138
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:54,485
Then what is the point?

139
00:08:54,553 --> 00:08:56,654
Sex is the only weapon
you have against her.

140
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:57,989
She's treating you like shit

141
00:08:58,057 --> 00:08:59,257
because she's afraid of losing you.

142
00:09:00,526 --> 00:09:03,461
Prove to her that she's right,

143
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:06,230
and she'll be blowing rainbows
up your ass again.

144
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,098
I think that I love her.

145
00:09:11,536 --> 00:09:13,270
Hey!

146
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,006
What's your story? I mean,
how come you get to live here?

147
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:18,908
You know, I heard they took
that lady to the loony bin.

148
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,176
I don't live here yet.

149
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,710
I'm moving in soon, though.

150
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,080
Dr. Harmon and I are in love.

151
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,448
Okay...

152
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,550
then how come you rocked out with me?

153
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:32,254
To see if I could do it
with a guy who's still alive.

154
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,857
# Ah-ha-ha, spooky. #

155
00:09:37,426 --> 00:09:39,327
Dr. Harmon, Detective
Jack Colquitt.

156
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,661
Missing Persons, right?

157
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:43,230
Mm-hmm. This young lady
believes you might be

158
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,233
involved in a case we just opened.

159
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,868
You don't remember me, Ben?
Marla McClaine.

160
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:48,436
Hayden's sister?

161
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,305
<i>I honestly have no idea</i>
<i>what happened to her.</i>

162
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,207
In fact, I have a few questions
for her myself.

163
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,677
You're a liar.
Hayden is pregnant with your baby.

164
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,946
And she comes here with the crazy idea

165
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,983
that somehow, you're gonna leave
your wife, support her

166
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,051
and raise your child together.

167
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:03,520
So what'd you do, Ben?
Where is she?

168
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:05,055
In a hole somewhere?

169
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,590
Dr. Harmon, the last time
I was here, I saw Ms. McClaine's

170
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,158
sister coming out of the house.

171
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,195
Yes. We made plans to
go to lunch... at Norm's.

172
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:13,763
You were also working in
the backyard digging

173
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:15,198
weren't you, around the time
she disappeared?

174
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,766
Detective, you have no idea
what happened here.

175
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,035
That's what we're here to find out.

176
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:20,670
What's with all the drama?

177
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:23,573
- What the hell, Hayden?
- How come you haven't

178
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:26,176
answered your phone
or called or anything?

179
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:28,211
Uh, to be honest with you,
Marla, I didn't think

180
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,812
you gave a rat's ass about me.

181
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,715
I thought you were calling
to borrow money again.

182
00:10:31,782 --> 00:10:33,316
So you're okay, then?

183
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,317
Obviously you're not missing.

184
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,519
Nope.

185
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,188
You don't have to worry about me, sis.

186
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:40,423
You were wrong about Ben.

187
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,860
I've decided to stay
here in La-La Land.

188
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,663
This is my home now.

189
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,935
You got about ten
seconds to give me

190
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,871
some answers before
I call that detective back

191
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,740
and have you arrested
for assaulting my family.

192
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,541
I'm-I'm sorry, Ben.

193
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:00,011
I was pregnant, scared and hormonal.

194
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,514
I was a crazy bitch
when I came here on Halloween.

195
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:05,184
I deserve whatever punishment
you think is right.

196
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:07,319
Ben, this whole thing
has been so ugly.

197
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:08,520
It's not me.

198
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,322
It's not how I want you
to think of me.

199
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,924
I don't know if we have
a future together,

200
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,258
but I've always been there for you.

201
00:11:13,326 --> 00:11:14,860
From the beginning.

202
00:11:14,928 --> 00:11:16,729
I just want you to remember that.

203
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,802
By the way...

204
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,603
I had the abortion.

205
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:25,672
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

206
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:32,010
Dr. Harmon?

207
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,246
Excuse me, do we have an appointment?

208
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:36,814
I was told there was a doctor
here who might help me.

209
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:39,150
You need to call
and make an appointment.

210
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:41,552
Doctor, I think something
terrible might happen to me.

211
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,453
What do you mean,
"something terrible"?

212
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,522
I'm not quite certain.

213
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,323
It's a strange feeling.

214
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:48,092
An endless foreboding.

215
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,428
Like a dream I can't wake
myself out of.

216
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:52,163
Sounds like acute anxiety.

217
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,831
But you really--
It's worse than that.

218
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,900
I do things with men.

219
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,069
Things I shouldn't.

220
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,085
But I'm a great actress,
and it's frustrating.

221
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,855
I just need that break.

222
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:06,205
All you need is that one
person who believes in you--

223
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,564
and every time I go into an audition,

224
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,700
I think maybe he's the one and...

225
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,168
I get carried away.

226
00:12:13,236 --> 00:12:14,804
Do you know what I mean?
I do.

227
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:27,116
I have an opening tomorrow at noon.

228
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:28,417
What's your name?

229
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:29,585
Elizabeth Short.

230
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,388
I assume you're
covered by SAG insurance?

231
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:34,523
I see.

232
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:35,758
Well, you're a beautiful young girl.

233
00:12:35,826 --> 00:12:37,727
I just assumed that
you were working steadily.

234
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,195
In the meantime, we need to discuss

235
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:40,496
how you plan to pay for treatment.

236
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,934
Do you really think I'm beautiful?

237
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:47,702
Really?

238
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,537
You're, um...

239
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,405
an attractive young woman.

240
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:57,210
No, no, no, no, Beth,
we, we, we just discussed that.

241
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,512
You don't need to do that.

242
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,180
But I don't know how else to pay you.

243
00:13:00,248 --> 00:13:02,582
I know you're the one who can help me.

244
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,018
I can tell you understand.

245
00:13:05,086 --> 00:13:06,186
Well, we can...

246
00:13:06,254 --> 00:13:08,589
figure something out.

247
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,529
You never need to do that with me.

248
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm the one you should feel safe with.

249
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:30,645
Excuse me.

250
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,851
Uh, I need to, I need to get this.

251
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,019
You won't regret this.

252
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:36,886
Hello?

253
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,722
Uh, just-just slow down, Doctor.

254
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:39,989
I can't...
I can't understand you.

255
00:13:40,057 --> 00:13:41,624
I spoke with Vivien's psychiatrist,

256
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:43,426
and he doesn't feel she's
mentally strong enough

257
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:44,994
to hear this news right now.

258
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:46,496
Normally, I would be
very uncomfortable

259
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,531
giving a husband this information,

260
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:51,101
but you are her designated
health care proxy.

261
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:53,269
Would you just tell me
what's going on, Doctor?

262
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,439
Heteropaternal superfecundation.

263
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:56,206
Hetero-what?

264
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:57,407
Your wife's twins

265
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,109
have different fathers.

266
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:00,711
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:01,712
What did you say?

268
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,447
It's extremely rare.

269
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:04,748
Maybe one in a million.

270
00:14:04,816 --> 00:14:06,350
Your wife must have had

271
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:08,718
intercourse with two different men

272
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:10,988
during the same ovulation cycle,

273
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:12,799
within a 48-hour period.

274
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,084
Where is she?
Little slut.

275
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:22,918
Who?

276
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,010
Violet.

277
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,092
She's been catting around
with my dog walker.

278
00:14:26,212 --> 00:14:27,287
Nonsense.

279
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:29,625
The girl's taste in men
is hardly refined,

280
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:31,326
but I doubt it runs to rough trade.

281
00:14:31,394 --> 00:14:33,996
Well, when Travis came back
from dog walking--

282
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:37,533
a 15-minute affair that somehow
stretched into 45--

283
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,437
he smelled... of something
other than canine.

284
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:42,738
You're delusional.

285
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,007
That girl wouldn't give
your greasy boy toy

286
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,508
a second glance.

287
00:14:46,576 --> 00:14:50,479
She thinks she's in love
with your little angel.

288
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,382
But once the truth comes out,
I suspect that'll change.

289
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:56,318
What the hell are you babbling about?

290
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:59,254
The two babies her
mother is carrying--

291
00:14:59,322 --> 00:15:01,323
only one of them was
fathered by Dr. Harmon.

292
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:08,097
Tate?

293
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,600
Tate, honey, it's Mama.

294
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,935
I have to talk to you.

295
00:15:14,003 --> 00:15:15,770
Tate?

296
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:16,838
Tate...?

297
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:18,573
- So talk.
- Oh!

298
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,608
Oh, God.

299
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,410
Tell me it isn't true,

300
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:25,046
what I've been hearing about you.

301
00:15:25,114 --> 00:15:26,481
About what?

302
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,615
Your behavior.

303
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,652
God, after all the missteps,

304
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,954
we finally have somebody in this house

305
00:15:34,022 --> 00:15:36,190
that maybe can help you.

306
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:42,695
Tell me you did not crawl
on top of that man's wife.

307
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,833
Oh...

308
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,302
Mama... Mama, you can't
tell Violet, okay?

309
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,537
Please don't...

310
00:15:51,605 --> 00:15:54,706
What is wrong with you, for God sakes?

311
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,875
What's wrong with you?
Mama!

312
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:59,177
Don't you realize what you've done?

313
00:15:59,244 --> 00:16:01,679
Mama...!

314
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:11,989
Come play, Ben.

315
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,558
Come, Ben...

316
00:16:14,626 --> 00:16:16,393
Please...?

317
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:25,501
Oh, Ben...

318
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:40,183
Get out.

319
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:42,819
Elizabeth, put your
clothes on and leave.

320
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:44,820
I'm sorry, but I can't
treat you anymore.

321
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:49,992
You're not really gonna
turn this down, are you?

322
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,960
And you're fired.

323
00:16:51,028 --> 00:16:52,329
Sue me if you need to.

324
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,231
Make your last chore to show her out.

325
00:16:58,503 --> 00:16:59,937
You said this would work.

326
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,839
You said this is what he wanted.

327
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:03,040
She's using you, honey.

328
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:17,187
My dreams will never come true.

329
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:18,588
Your dreams?

330
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,692
I know it sounds terribly selfish,

331
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:24,426
but I must become famous.

332
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:27,764
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

333
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,365
Honey, don't you know who you are?

334
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:30,834
I'm Elizabeth Short.

335
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,536
You really don't know, do you?

336
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:57,395
God, you're beautiful.

337
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:01,498
Now, let's look at those teeth.

338
00:18:07,237 --> 00:18:08,070
Beth?

339
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:12,408
Beth...

340
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:14,177
Oh, God!

341
00:18:26,057 --> 00:18:27,090
Who are you?

342
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,691
My name is Charles Montgomery.

343
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:31,227
I am quite a renowned surgeon.

344
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,261
I'm here to help you.

345
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,422
What have you done?

346
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:00,691
I've bisected her body,

347
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,328
removed the intestines
and drained her blood.

348
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:06,064
Why?
A writer writes, a surgeon cuts.

349
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:09,301
I think you will find
these pieces more portable.

350
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:11,036
What are you doing now?

351
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,072
She seemed so sad.

352
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,509
I've decided to give her a smile
that will last forever.

353
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:20,814
<i>That's how they found me--</i>

354
00:19:20,882 --> 00:19:24,417
naked, on display for
the whole world to see.

355
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:27,554
You were the front-page news of
every paper for two months.

356
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,528
I really did become somebody.

357
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:37,732
She's been extremely agitated,

358
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,701
and the paranoia hasn't abated.

359
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,938
I'm sure the doctor will change
up the meds when he gets here,

360
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:46,108
but, in the meantime, we've
had to keep her restrained.

361
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:47,709
Restrained?

362
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:50,512
She attacked one of the orderlies.

363
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,215
He suggested that this
rapist in a rubber suit

364
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,684
was some kind of sexual fantasy.

365
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,854
Vivien...

366
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,288
you have a visitor.

367
00:20:13,535 --> 00:20:17,105
I know you can't carry on
a conversation right now.

368
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:18,273
That's okay.

369
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,209
I know what you're thinking.

370
00:20:20,277 --> 00:20:22,211
You're thinking, "Thank God he's here."

371
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,714
"Thank God he can see
what they're doing to me,

372
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,282
"and how wrong it is.

373
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,386
And thank God he's a shrink,
so he can get me out of here."

374
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:31,854
You're right.

375
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,758
You're in hell here.

376
00:20:36,826 --> 00:20:38,527
This is no place for my wife.

377
00:20:38,594 --> 00:20:40,329
And I'd move heaven and earth

378
00:20:40,396 --> 00:20:42,965
for the Vivien I thought
I was married to.

379
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,234
But you aren't her.

380
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:48,069
You're a stranger to me.

381
00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:52,640
You actually pretended,

382
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,043
maybe even believed, like a sociopath,

383
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:58,079
that you were some kind of
holy saint without sin

384
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,349
while you shit all over me...

385
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:03,185
our life...

386
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,720
and our family

387
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:08,257
with betrayal and lies.

388
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,994
The way I feel right now,

389
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,664
I wouldn't lift a finger
to help you get out of here.

390
00:21:32,135 --> 00:21:34,037
God, I miss college.

391
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,353
Enjoy it before real life
knocks you on your ass.

392
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:40,252
Do you want to talk about it?

393
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,209
Nope. I don't.

394
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,463
I miss beer.

395
00:21:46,531 --> 00:21:48,331
Vivien hates it when I drink.

396
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:49,198
Especially beer.

397
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,800
I like beer.

398
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:52,835
Mm! There you go!

399
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,764
Can I confess something to you?

400
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:58,874
Hmm! I think the smart answer
would have to be no.

401
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:03,078
I'm not really confused about
interpersonal aggression.

402
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:04,379
You're not?
Uh-uh.

403
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:07,015
That's a shame, because
I could tell you a lot

404
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:10,184
about interpersonal aggression.

405
00:22:10,252 --> 00:22:12,453
My marriage, for one thing.

406
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,588
Not in a happy place right now.

407
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:18,026
See? You do want
to talk about it.

408
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,529
I don't. I just want to--
I just want to drink

409
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:23,399
and get drunk and stumble
home on the T.

410
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:31,374
The thing is, Dr. Harmon--

411
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:33,109
I have a crush on you.

412
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:38,681
That's a bad move.

413
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:40,116
Seriously. I mean...

414
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:43,419
You're going to have
so many men in your life.

415
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,087
What does that mean?

416
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,422
It means you're a knockout.

417
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,991
You're smart as hell.
Is hell smart?

418
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:53,427
Oh, oh, listen to this guitar solo.

419
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:55,329
I mean, it's-it's incredible.

420
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:07,343
It was written in the stars.

421
00:23:07,411 --> 00:23:10,147
And I was meant to take your class

422
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:13,717
right at the moment
your marriage imploded.

423
00:23:13,785 --> 00:23:15,219
You needed me, Ben.

424
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:16,421
I did.

425
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:19,123
I did need you.

426
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:21,526
But I shouldn't have crossed the line.

427
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,527
Ben...
I abused my authority.

428
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:29,334
I was a consenting adult.

429
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:30,401
I still am.

430
00:23:30,469 --> 00:23:33,104
Hayden, please, listen to me.

431
00:23:33,172 --> 00:23:35,673
My marriage was a mess when we met.

432
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,344
And now? It's even worse, Ben.

433
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:41,513
You're right, it's bad.

434
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:43,950
It's really bad.
But here's the thing, Hayden--

435
00:23:44,017 --> 00:23:47,086
and I hope you understand this--

436
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:49,990
we weren't written in the stars.

437
00:23:50,057 --> 00:23:52,192
We're not meant to be together.

438
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,995
Not then, not now,

439
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,263
not six months from now.
Ben...

440
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,766
I was lonely, I was
heartbroken and I used you.

441
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,868
It was unforgivable.
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:01,935 --> 00:24:05,003
But no matter what
happens with my wife,

443
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:07,005
I can't be with you.

444
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:11,142
I don't love you, Hayden.

445
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,844
I'm sorry.

446
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:15,880
I never did.

447
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:19,117
You don't love me?

448
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,654
You don't love me.

449
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,324
Okay.

450
00:24:29,462 --> 00:24:31,296
Could I have a hug?

451
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:33,198
Of course.

452
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:48,313
Hayden, come on.
It's over.

453
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,381
You can't just hang around here.

454
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,617
I'm not just hanging around here.

455
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,218
I came for a reason.

456
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:59,357
When it concerns your family,
you have a right to know.

457
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:01,125
What are you talking about?

458
00:25:01,193 --> 00:25:05,430
Vivien and that black guy--
you know, in the uniform.

459
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:08,265
I came around here the other
morning and he was leaving.

460
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:10,601
Who knows how long it's been going on?

461
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:12,904
Just thought you should know.

462
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,776
Travis.

463
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:20,578
I need to talk to you, honey.

464
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:22,447
You mean yell at me some more?

465
00:25:22,514 --> 00:25:23,948
On the contrary.

466
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,751
I want to apologize
for my earlier manners.

467
00:25:26,819 --> 00:25:28,787
It was unnecessarily cruel.

468
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,756
Well, you've been going through
a lot of stuff lately, so...

469
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:37,195
It's true, I have.
But so have you. Here by my side.

470
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:43,569
Oh, and don't think it hasn't
gone unnoticed or unappreciated.

471
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:50,677
You know, in many ways,
you are a fine man, Travis.

472
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,648
Sit down, baby.
I want to ask you something.

473
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:58,418
Okay.

474
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:03,256
What do you want to ask me?

475
00:26:03,324 --> 00:26:05,926
Will you marry me?

476
00:26:05,993 --> 00:26:09,296
Marry you?!

477
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:11,998
Listen to me, there's
going to be a child

478
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,701
and I want to bring that
child into this home

479
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,803
and raise it as my own.

480
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,738
What child?

481
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:22,809
Our child-- or it could be.

482
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:24,344
We could be a family.

483
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:27,814
I won't make the same mistakes
that I made the last time.

484
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:31,785
And you would be a wonderful father.

485
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:34,789
Father, whoa. Um...

486
00:26:34,857 --> 00:26:37,392
I'm not ready to be a father.
Oh, but you are.

487
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:42,064
I've seen how you were with Addie,
and with the dogs.

488
00:26:42,131 --> 00:26:44,233
With Addie and the dogs, it's...

489
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,135
Okay...

490
00:26:46,202 --> 00:26:48,104
What about my career?
Your what?

491
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,973
My career, you know.

492
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,841
Maybe-- I don't know,
maybe we should wait

493
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,610
and let me get myself established

494
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,679
and then we could do whatever, you know?
What career?

495
00:26:56,747 --> 00:27:02,151
What? This dream you have
of-- of appearing half naked

496
00:27:02,218 --> 00:27:05,054
in your skivvies 60 feet
high above Times Square?

497
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:07,622
I don't know why
that's so funny to you.

498
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,427
I know that dream.
I had that dream!

499
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,429
I was going to be a big star,

500
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:16,766
and, baby, if it didn't happen for me,

501
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:19,001
it is not going to happen for you.

502
00:27:19,069 --> 00:27:22,471
Why are you being so mean?

503
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:25,074
I am being honest.
No, you're being mean.

504
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:29,346
A lean torso in this town
is a dime a dozen, baby,

505
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:31,448
and that's all you've got.

506
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:33,583
I'm offering reality,

507
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,487
community property,
a chance to be somebody.

508
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,456
A father.

509
00:27:39,523 --> 00:27:41,758
I mean, look at you. What are you now?
You're nothing.

510
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:46,362
No, I am something, and just
because you say that I'm not

511
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,230
going to make it, doesn't mean it's true!
Oh!

512
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,466
Doesn't mean it's true.
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

513
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:54,837
God, how could I have ever
thought you could be a father?

514
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:58,508
You are not even a man.

515
00:27:58,575 --> 00:27:59,976
Oh, come on...

516
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,645
Don't you dare!

517
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,714
You'd better be careful.
You know why?

518
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:08,620
Because the last man who thought
that he could strike me...

519
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:14,859
...came to a very unpleasant
end, and he was a man.

520
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,272
She said that I wasn't a man.

521
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,242
She said I'd never be famous.

522
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,444
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

523
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:43,053
Feel better?

524
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,389
Yeah.

525
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:46,924
I don't.

526
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,028
He said we weren't
meant to be together.

527
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,463
We were meant to be.

528
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:54,432
Let's go again.

529
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,101
What are you doing?

530
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,270
I totally thought you came.
No.

531
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,639
Really?

532
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:05,544
Look, uh, would you mind
finishing yourself?

533
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,146
I really got to go.

534
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,448
- I mean, I can't leave it like this
with Constance. - You're kidding me.

535
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,050
I thought you said you hated her.

536
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:14,353
I guess I love her.

537
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,588
And we got a baby coming.

538
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,423
A baby what, fossil?
I don't know.

539
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,192
I guess we're going to adopt.

540
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,094
After all that shit she said to you?

541
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,830
I'm going to come back, I promise.

542
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,769
Can I at least get a hug?
Yeah.

543
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:33,110
I had a really good time.

544
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,013
Shit!

545
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,830
I had a really great time, too.

546
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:08,731
Oh, shit, now what am I going
to do with you?

547
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:12,696
Whoa, Constance was right.

548
00:30:12,816 --> 00:30:15,934
Now I'm never going to be famous.

549
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:18,536
That's not necessarily true.

550
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:21,306
In fact, now you might
even have a better chance.

551
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:23,875
The only one who's going to be
famous out of this is Ben

552
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:25,310
when they find the body down here.

553
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:27,479
They'll send him to prison.

554
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:30,359
Or he'll move out.
Goddamn it.

555
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:32,984
Who's to say the body
has to be found here?

556
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,787
What, are you going to drag
him out of here, Casper?

557
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:37,956
Well, if you know someone who might,

558
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,626
I could certainly make it easier.

559
00:30:40,693 --> 00:30:43,061
There is someone who owes me a favor.

560
00:30:59,944 --> 00:31:02,012
Shit.

561
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,647
Holy shit.

562
00:31:03,714 --> 00:31:05,916
Yo, yo! Yo, come over here!

563
00:31:10,723 --> 00:31:12,390
What?

564
00:31:12,458 --> 00:31:14,459
Holy shit.

565
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,428
Holy shit. Yo!

566
00:31:47,361 --> 00:31:49,162
Knock, knock.

567
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,264
My dear--

568
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,934
look at you.

569
00:31:54,002 --> 00:31:56,804
Even this hideous place

570
00:31:56,872 --> 00:32:00,241
can't dim
your charming girlish spirit.

571
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:02,643
Hello, Constance.
What a surprise.

572
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,746
Well, I hope it is a good one.

573
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:08,450
You know, I've been
thinking about you so much

574
00:32:08,517 --> 00:32:11,987
and about this ordeal
that you've been through.

575
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:14,656
And being pregnant on top
of everything else.

576
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,425
My goodness, that poor baby.

577
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:19,227
Babies, it's twins.

578
00:32:19,295 --> 00:32:22,164
Oh, of course.
Babies.

579
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,902
And is everything all right
with the babies?

580
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,971
They're growing very fast.

581
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,108
You can't believe how much food
I've been consuming.

582
00:32:32,176 --> 00:32:33,810
Even in here, I'm just ravenous.

583
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:34,778
That's a good thing.

584
00:32:34,846 --> 00:32:36,280
Oh, Vivien, Vivien,

585
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:42,719
I want you to know that I
intend to be there for you.

586
00:32:42,787 --> 00:32:45,856
Whatever help you need.

587
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,525
I mean, babies are my thing.
I have a special gift.

588
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:50,560
And I've been a
single mother, I mean...

589
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:55,631
I know how we tell ourselves
that we don't need a man.

590
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:58,133
We can do it alone.
But the secret, Vivien?

591
00:32:58,201 --> 00:33:01,437
The secret is community.

592
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,039
Sisterhood.

593
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:07,277
Constance, I don't want to
be rude or seem ungrateful,

594
00:33:07,345 --> 00:33:09,413
I'm just so tired, and I just...

595
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,114
Probably from the meds.
I need to nap.

596
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:12,649
Of course, honey.

597
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:14,919
Oh, I'll just disappear...

598
00:33:14,986 --> 00:33:16,720
Vivien, you know,

599
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:20,692
I know the pain of being doubted
by everyone around you.

600
00:33:24,163 --> 00:33:26,698
It ravages the soul.

601
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,472
Well, those are for you.

602
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,875
Thank you.

603
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:39,079
I-I think I might stop by
at Sweet Lady Jane's,

604
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:42,282
and pick up some pastry for
that sweet little Violet.

605
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,383
Constance.

606
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:49,656
I was raped.

607
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:55,862
I didn't hallucinate any of it.

608
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:59,233
Well, of course not.

609
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,234
Oh, honey, I never
doubted it for a minute.

610
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,069
Please don't tell
anybody that I told you,

611
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,672
because I need for them to think
that I'm coming to my senses

612
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,674
so that I can get out of here.

613
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:09,576
Of course.

614
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:14,281
You poor thing.

615
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:16,683
What you've been through...

616
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:31,298
You didn't have to
trigger the alarm system

617
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:33,533
to get me over here.

618
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:36,503
I've been wracking my brains,
trying to figure it out.

619
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:38,839
I gotta hand it to you both.

620
00:34:38,906 --> 00:34:41,074
It was a terrific cover.

621
00:34:42,243 --> 00:34:43,710
I'm lost here.

622
00:34:43,778 --> 00:34:47,014
Where'd you meet her?
At Whole Foods? At the gym?

623
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:49,116
I installed your
security system, remember?

624
00:34:49,184 --> 00:34:52,286
We moved here in early fall.

625
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:53,654
You met Vivien...

626
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:55,923
whenever.

627
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:58,359
Started having an affair.

628
00:34:58,427 --> 00:34:59,894
Got her pregnant.
What?

629
00:34:59,961 --> 00:35:01,128
She's having twins.

630
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:02,897
And only one of them is mine.

631
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,901
Ah, okay.

632
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:10,671
So I guess the other one must be mine.

633
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:12,406
Look...

634
00:35:12,474 --> 00:35:15,075
I'm not asking you for child support.

635
00:35:15,143 --> 00:35:17,112
In fact, you're not even
gonna see this baby.

636
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:20,415
I just want to hear it
from you, man to man...

637
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:22,451
All right.

638
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:23,785
Man to man.

639
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:26,322
Hear this, Ben.

640
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,360
If that was my baby,
you couldn't keep me away.

641
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,796
But the sad fact is, is
that I'm shooting blanks.

642
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,732
You can ask my ex-wife.

643
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,000
We tried for five years.

644
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,635
All it takes is one good swimmer.

645
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:41,072
Look... I don't know
Vivien that well.

646
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,275
But clearly she has
been a very busy girl.

647
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:45,478
Hey, don't talk about
my wife like that.

648
00:35:45,545 --> 00:35:46,845
You don't know her.
And you do?

649
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:53,018
You called her a whore and a liar.

650
00:35:53,086 --> 00:35:54,787
That was just in
the last five minutes.

651
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,589
Your own wife...

652
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,958
You locked her away, Ben.

653
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,696
You know what?

654
00:36:06,899 --> 00:36:08,632
Maybe it's good.

655
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,767
Maybe she's safer there.

656
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,715
Kinky.

657
00:36:25,782 --> 00:36:28,351
You want me to try that on?

658
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,353
Looks like you went to
a lot of trouble to find it.

659
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,255
What do you know about this?

660
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,491
I know I get wet just thinking about

661
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:36,493
sliding that rubber on my body.

662
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,096
Stop it. Stop your bullshit
and listen to me.

663
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,499
You're in this house all
the time. You see everything.

664
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:42,733
What happened with Vivien?

665
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,102
Why do you care?
You're a man.

666
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,604
Isn't this what all men want?

667
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,741
The freedom to satiate
their needs, guilt-free?

668
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,042
Just tell me the truth.

669
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,613
I think I made a horrible mistake

670
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,049
by putting Vivien in the hospital.

671
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,818
She was attacked by someone.

672
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:07,891
Congratulations, Dr. Harmon.

673
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,437
You're finally beginning
to see things as they are.

674
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,983
I think we're gonna get
a pickup on my Lifetime pilot.

675
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,620
And as soon as we do, I want
to bring you on as my guest.

676
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,158
I can't focus on your...

677
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,560
career right now.

678
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:46,864
I may be looking at a rather
earth-shattering situation.

679
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:50,568
Could we be talking menopause baby...?

680
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:52,069
Why am I seeing baby pictures?

681
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,971
Tell me...

682
00:37:57,643 --> 00:38:01,546
What happens when a human...

683
00:38:01,614 --> 00:38:04,215
copulates with someone
from the spirit world?

684
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,118
Spirits aren't known
for their potency.

685
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:10,021
Yes, but...

686
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:14,125
what if there is,
in fact, a conception?

687
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:17,028
You do know about the box.

688
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,632
The Pope's box?

689
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,333
What the hell are you talking about?

690
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:27,571
When a new Pope has been chosen...

691
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,641
and the bells of
St. Peter's chime...

692
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:34,411
<i>...he is shown into</i>
<i>a small chamber</i>

693
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,814
<i>next to the Sistine Chapel.</i>

694
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,350
They call it <i>the Room of Tears,</i>

695
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:42,987
<i>named for the sublime mixture</i>
<i>of joy and sorrow</i>

696
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,757
<i>that he must contemplate</i>
<i>at this moment.</i>

697
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:48,927
<i>He is brought a key to this box.</i>

698
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:54,033
<i>It has been said that this box</i>
<i>contains the ultimate secret.</i>

699
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,169
<i>It holds the secret</i>

700
00:38:56,237 --> 00:38:57,837
<i>of the end of the world.</i>

701
00:38:57,905 --> 00:39:00,774
Well, for Christ's sakes, Billie Dean,

702
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,275
the cameras aren't rolling in here.

703
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:03,776
Will you just cut to the chase?

704
00:39:03,844 --> 00:39:06,646
This piece of paper
reveals the precise nature

705
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:08,547
of the Anti-Christ.

706
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:14,085
"A child born of human and spirit

707
00:39:14,153 --> 00:39:16,186
will usher in the end of times."

708
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:22,860
It is the essence of evil.

709
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,829
A perversion of
the Immaculate Conception.

710
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:28,332
What are you talking about?

711
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,100
Oh, come on, honey.

712
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:34,037
The Holy Ghost merely whispered
in the Virgin Mary's ear

713
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,572
and she begat the son of God.

714
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:41,651
If the devil's going to use
a human womb for his spawn,

715
00:39:41,956 --> 00:39:45,048
he's going to want a little
more bang for his buck.

716
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:52,176
