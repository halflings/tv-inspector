1
00:00:14,356 --> 00:00:16,454
I'll be home around 4:00.

2
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:25,457
I need help
carving these pumpkins.

3
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,703
Who is that?
It's Marie Antoinette.

4
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:31,541
I'm doing a famous
French figures theme this year.

5
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:32,643
I'm hitting the gym.

6
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,781
Well, make sure
you wear a condom.

7
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,417
And pick me up some Gala apples.

8
00:00:38,485 --> 00:00:40,921
I thought these Golden Delicious
would look dramatic

9
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,691
in the bobbing bucket; they just
look dull and depressing.

10
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,627
There's no contrast.

11
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:50,963
Why would I wear
a condom at the gym?

12
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,599
Maybe because you're screwing
that twink trainer of yours.

13
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:54,934
And I need gourds.

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,303
I'm going to hang them
on the tree out front,

15
00:00:58,371 --> 00:00:59,941
spray-paint them,

16
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:01,809
and they're going to be these

17
00:01:01,877 --> 00:01:03,745
clever little organic ghosts.

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,948
You know what? I am.

19
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,085
You are what?
Screwing my trainer.

20
00:01:08,152 --> 00:01:10,255
You know what else?
He's a power bottom.

21
00:01:10,323 --> 00:01:11,523
He loves it.

22
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:14,426
First of all, please
remember our agreement:

23
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:16,596
don't ask, don't tell.

24
00:01:16,664 --> 00:01:19,767
Secondly, is this crass
admission supposed to...

25
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:21,535
hurt me?

26
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,170
At this point with you,

27
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:25,605
I'm bulletproof.

28
00:01:26,607 --> 00:01:28,308
And I need some dry ice.

29
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,909
Have you picked out
a costume yet?

30
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,578
Why are you doing this?
Because there's gonna be

31
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:32,812
a party here in three days.

32
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,547
This is all bullshit,
this is all bullshit!

33
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:36,482
Everything we've become
is bullshit!

34
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,050
I don't give a shit
about carving pumpkins.

35
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:39,318
I want love,

36
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,021
I want passion, I want
a relationship with a man,

37
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:42,189
not Martha Stewart!

38
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:43,424
Then leave!

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,528
Oh, I forgot, you can't.

40
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,030
Because all of
your money and mine

41
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:49,364
is in this house that we agreed

42
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:50,799
to flip and make a mint on,

43
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,067
and now we can't because
the economy is in the shitter.

44
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,837
Do you think I like
carving 20 pumpkins

45
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:57,907
and getting squash guts
under my nails?

46
00:01:57,975 --> 00:02:00,009
I am trying here!

47
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:04,148
I'm trying to make
this place warm

48
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:06,751
and inviting and spectacular

49
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:09,088
and have this Halloween party
shot by <i>Elle</i> friggin' <i>Decor</i>

50
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:11,758
so someone will see it and
swoop in and take this place

51
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:13,894
off our hands, and
then I can feel free

52
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:16,497
to fall in love with a 25-year
old who has great biceps.

53
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:19,100
So get off my back,
carve a goddamn pumpkin,

54
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,169
go get a goddamn
outfit and man up.

55
00:02:26,642 --> 00:02:30,044
I can't believe
this is who we've become.

56
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:31,946
Halloqueens arguing
over pumpkins.

57
00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:38,519
We wanted to have a baby.

58
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:42,924
We were going to have this...

59
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:44,726
great life.

60
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:03,348
Red is wrong.

61
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:05,551
It has to be green.

62
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,794
Funny.

63
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,929
It's good, actually.

64
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:18,532
It's very... scary, sexy.

65
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,538
Come help me with these bats.

66
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,808
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:26,876 --> 00:03:30,379
I'm sorry for everything--
my attitude, my low sex drive.

68
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:32,681
It's probably low testosterone
from stress.

69
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:35,717
I'm seeing a doctor next week.

70
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:41,596
Did you get the apples?

71
00:04:49,928 --> 00:05:00,853
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

72
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:05,874
This is unacceptable, Marcy.

73
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:08,421
One person has seen
the house in two weeks.

74
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,379
And she didn't even stay
for the whole tour

75
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:11,903
because she was
so spooked out by it.

76
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,305
You need to do something.

77
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,307
Don't put the blame on
Mame here, Mr. Harmon.

78
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,283
This house has an image problem,
it's as simple as that.

79
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,625
Fix that problem and this property
will sell real fast.

80
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:22,679
What are we supposed to do?

81
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,414
I think we need a fluffer here.

82
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:25,582
A what?

83
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,917
Fluffers.

84
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,820
People we can hire

85
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:31,122
to come in at a nominal fee

86
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,359
and give a dash of style
and élan to this place.

87
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:36,694
We have style.

88
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:37,895
Everybody thinks
they have style,

89
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,330
and everybody thinks
they're funny.

90
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:40,698
Most people aren't.

91
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,701
That's why in my business
we have fluffers.

92
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:46,103
They come in,
they rent some accessories,

93
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:48,272
karate chop a few throw pillows,

94
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,709
make this home look
like a magazine spread.

95
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,277
It's Halloween.

96
00:05:53,345 --> 00:05:55,079
Imagine the mileage
you would get

97
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,714
if you could decorate
your front porch

98
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,850
with divine cheery pumpkins.

99
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,052
Lots of happy
trick-or-treaters

100
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,454
means parents who talk
to their friends,

101
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:07,156
means more looky-loos,
means better PR.

102
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:10,859
I heard you were egged
last night, Mr. Harmon.

103
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,432
Hey!

104
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,301
Happy Halloween, asshole!

105
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,669
Get out of here! Huh?

106
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:21,237
Little shit!

107
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:23,273
Why did you tell her that?

108
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,909
You know, on this one topic,
I agree with her.

109
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,411
We have an image problem.

110
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,148
We are on the murder house tour,
for God's sakes.

111
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:32,984
Marcy, do you know
any of these fluffers?

112
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:35,520
Can you get one
for us immediately?

113
00:06:35,588 --> 00:06:38,856
Yes, a wonderful English
lady, a real pro,

114
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:41,559
but she's more expensive than
the young gay fellow I know.

115
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:42,660
Let's go with the gay fellow.

116
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,495
Gay fellow.
I'll call the fluffer.

117
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:51,001
Halloween comes from
the Celtic holiday of Samhain.

118
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,004
It commemorated the end
of the harvest festival.

119
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:55,205
They celebrated it

120
00:06:55,273 --> 00:06:57,207
to ward off their fears.

121
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,108
The Celtic dudes believed that

122
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,677
on October 31,

123
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:04,114
the boundary separating the
realms of the living and dead

124
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:08,485
disappeared and the dead could
walk amongst the living.

125
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,023
That's why people dress up,
to scare away the ghosts.

126
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,092
No way I ever want
to be a ghost.

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,494
It's so sad.

128
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,063
What are you going to dress up
as this year, Addy?

129
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:21,400
Are you blushing?

130
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:23,102
Look at you.

131
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,905
You know what?

132
00:07:24,973 --> 00:07:26,306
I think that's

133
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,708
a hell of a costume.

134
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:29,743
I tell you you could
eat all my chocolate chips?

135
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:31,712
I was gonna make cookies
out of those later,

136
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,080
but now someone's

137
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:35,616
gonna have to run down
to the Korean to get some more.

138
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:36,717
I'll go.

139
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:44,390
Get me a carton of Pall Malls.

140
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,527
I'll use the change
to fill up my bike, cool?

141
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,400
Hmm?

142
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,339
Bye.

143
00:08:01,876 --> 00:08:03,377
What do you think you're doing?

144
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,380
You know how to read.

145
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:10,284
You just like mooning over him.

146
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:12,620
You remember what
happened to the last one?

147
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:13,955
It wasn't like that.

148
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:15,423
He was just reading.

149
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:16,691
Oh, one minute he's reading,

150
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,326
the next minute his hand
is down your pants.

151
00:08:18,393 --> 00:08:20,528
He smells better
than the last one.

152
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:23,264
What did you say?

153
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,735
Now, you listen to me
good, little girl.

154
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:32,005
I have given every inch
of my life to you

155
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,841
for the last 30 some years.

156
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,744
I would kill or die for you.

157
00:08:37,812 --> 00:08:39,012
But I will not

158
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,914
share the affections of the men

159
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:42,716
I bring into this house
with any woman.

160
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:43,784
You understand?

161
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,421
Hmm?

162
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,923
What's this?

163
00:08:48,991 --> 00:08:49,791
Halloween.

164
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:51,593
What did you tell him

165
00:08:51,661 --> 00:08:53,296
you wanted to go dressed up as?

166
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:54,563
Hmm?

167
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,432
You and your boyfriend
keeping secrets now?

168
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,102
I want to go as her.

169
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,937
As a pretty girl.

170
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,408
You can go as Snoopy again.

171
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:07,776
The costume will still fit

172
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:09,911
if you lay off
those chocolate chips.

173
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:11,146
Not Snoopy again.

174
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,647
You'll go as Snoopy
or not at all.

175
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,085
And when Travis comes back,

176
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:19,387
send him upstairs.

177
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:20,988
And no more of this.

178
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:23,057
The dead can walk freely

179
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:24,825
on Halloween.

180
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,129
We've always known that.

181
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:32,733
Trick or treat!

182
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:36,269
What are you doing here?

183
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:37,637
Um, trick or treat?

184
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,072
It's Halloweek.

185
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:40,406
I do the full seven days.

186
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,241
It's the only time I
can really be myself.

187
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:45,911
So, uh, just pop the thousand
dollars in the pumpkin here

188
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:47,479
and nobody will be the wiser.

189
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,347
Get off my property now.

190
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:50,348
Or what?

191
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:51,382
You'll call the cops?

192
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,150
You know what?
I just might.

193
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,319
I didn't do anything.

194
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:57,555
No? Well, that gazebo
in the backyard

195
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:59,157
sure went up pretty darn quick.

196
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,626
I have to wonder if you got
all the proper permits.

197
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:04,296
Maybe somebody should place a
call to the city's inspector

198
00:10:04,364 --> 00:10:06,499
and have him come down
here and check it out.

199
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,535
What's under that gazebo
is what you did.

200
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,437
But what's inside
what's under that gazebo

201
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:11,604
is what you did.

202
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:13,406
That is not my baby in there.

203
00:10:13,474 --> 00:10:15,341
Vivien finds that out,
your family is over.

204
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:20,146
Now... give
me my treat.

205
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:21,013
You don't want the trick.

206
00:10:25,618 --> 00:10:26,718
I'm done talking.

207
00:10:26,786 --> 00:10:28,419
I have a patient.

208
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,754
And I have patience.

209
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,589
But there is a limit.

210
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:37,962
<i>I've agreed to this meeting</i>

211
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,197
<i>because we need to clarify</i>
<i>a few things.</i>

212
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,499
Firstly, the psychiatrist

213
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,402
that I recommended to you,
Dr. Goldman,

214
00:10:43,469 --> 00:10:44,870
said you never showed up

215
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,707
for the first appointment
and you never called to cancel.

216
00:10:47,774 --> 00:10:49,609
I don't want to see
anyone but you.

217
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:52,112
We've discussed
why that won't work.

218
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,947
Which brings me
to my next question.

219
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:56,316
We're very grateful
to you, Tate,

220
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:58,485
for how you helped my family.

221
00:10:58,553 --> 00:11:01,355
But you need to explain
here and now

222
00:11:01,423 --> 00:11:02,923
what you were doing
in this house

223
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:04,391
at the time of the break-in.

224
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,260
The truth is

225
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:08,696
I was just, like,
hanging around outside,

226
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:11,432
and I was, I was throwing
pebbles at her window.

227
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,066
But she blew me off.

228
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:16,537
And then I noticed that the door
was unlocked,

229
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:19,940
so I... went inside.

230
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:23,344
It's not cool, I know.

231
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,945
I understand.

232
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:27,982
But this is why
I can't treat you.

233
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,386
It's inappropriate
for everyone concerned.

234
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,287
I really need your help.

235
00:11:34,355 --> 00:11:35,789
I don't want to be like this.

236
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:37,324
I want to be a good person.

237
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,259
And I know that
you can help me.

238
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:40,994
You're the one, okay?

239
00:11:41,062 --> 00:11:42,863
You're the only one
that I can trust.

240
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:46,467
I cannot see you in this house.

241
00:11:55,777 --> 00:11:57,344
Look, I have an opening.

242
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,579
I'll meet you someplace
for coffee, but you have

243
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:00,447
to promise me...

244
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,516
I promise you. Promise.

245
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:05,853
No more weird shit, okay?

246
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,157
This is your control panel.

247
00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,660
It operates one of the 15 window
and door sensors.

248
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:14,663
You're also gonna get

249
00:12:14,731 --> 00:12:17,332
this infrared motion detector.
It goes in your foyer.

250
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,367
This is your panic button.

251
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:21,678
Okay, I'm gonna hide one
of these in your nightstand,

252
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:23,717
probably put one in
the kitchen somewhere.

253
00:12:23,837 --> 00:12:25,334
Now, if something
goes bump in the night,

254
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:28,496
you hit this button,
and I'm on my way, all right?

255
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,805
Now given what you've gone
through lately,

256
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:33,848
I'm expecting some false alarms,
so don't be shy.

257
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,618
All right, if you say so.

258
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,439
Oh, I do.

259
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,257
Questions?

260
00:12:39,377 --> 00:12:42,010
I'm sure I have
a hundred questions, but

261
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,113
I can't think of anything
right now.

262
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,716
I mean, the system in
this house is so...

263
00:12:46,783 --> 00:12:48,150
Ah, yeah, it's from
the Reagan era.

264
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:49,485
Yeah.

265
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:51,653
You know if your power goes out
or someone cuts

266
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,021
your phone line,
something like that...

267
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:54,823
Yeah, we would be in
so much trouble.

268
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,891
Yeah, exactly. Right.

269
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,866
Did Marcy bring these pumpkins?

270
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,200
Yes.

271
00:13:06,268 --> 00:13:08,435
Oh, that's nice.

272
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:10,137
Thank you. I enjoy crafts.

273
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,771
Mrs. Harmon, a question.

274
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,873
Hmm?

275
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,841
May I have Halloween off?

276
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:16,643
I'd like to visit
with my mother.

277
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,178
Of course.

278
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,318
Done.

279
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,653
I'll put that one outside.

280
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:38,801
- Ugh!
- The roses have whitefly.

281
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:40,703
Jesus, what an eyesore.

282
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:41,838
Hi.

283
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:45,208
Hi.

284
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:48,245
Love the house,
so much potential.

285
00:13:48,313 --> 00:13:49,947
Thank you.

286
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,050
Are you Marcy's fluffers?

287
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:55,053
I'm Chad Warwick.

288
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,890
This is my ball
and chain, Patrick.

289
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,191
Welcome.

290
00:14:06,295 --> 00:14:08,310
This is actually kind of fun.

291
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,765
I never got to do this when I was a kid.
Why not?

292
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,363
So this is what you guys do
for a living.

293
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,355
That is amazing to me.

294
00:14:16,475 --> 00:14:17,563
And wonderful, you know.

295
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,755
I think style is so important.

296
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:21,774
It's everything.

297
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:26,712
It's so great that I get

298
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,060
to help you guys have
the best Halloween ever.

299
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,263
I love Halloween.
So does Patrick

300
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,557
because the bars are
just awash in twinks

301
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,576
with six packs in
revealing outfits.

302
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:36,669
Isn't that right, Pat?

303
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:39,980
The Abby, The O Bar, Rage.

304
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:41,567
That's where he was last year

305
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,023
instead of helping me
with the trick-or-treaters.

306
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,122
Have another drink, dear.
Crafting brings out

307
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,205
his inner George and Martha.

308
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:47,990
So, in addition
to Halloween night

309
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:50,558
and making everything look
inviting, which I get,

310
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:53,633
do you guys have any other
suggestions for what

311
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,974
we might do to the house
to make it sell faster?

312
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,208
Actually, yes.

313
00:14:57,873 --> 00:14:59,853
That gazebo's got to go.
The lattice is wrong.

314
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:01,655
I agree.
Oh, no, we just put it in.

315
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:04,855
Did you put that gazebo in yourself, Ben?
Yes.

316
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:06,493
Well, let's get through
tomorrow night,

317
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,629
and then we can tear it down,

318
00:15:08,697 --> 00:15:10,799
and put in an organic
cutting garden.

319
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,434
Ow! Shit!

320
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,002
Oh, my God!

321
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,038
Let me see.
I think I'm gonna need stitches.

322
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,307
No. No, it's okay.
I can fix this up.

323
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,475
Pat's an EMT.

324
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,710
Oh, I thought you were
a fluffer.

325
00:15:20,777 --> 00:15:22,512
You're hilarious, Vivien.

326
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:23,746
And I love the hair color.

327
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:24,714
I can barely see any root.

328
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:25,682
It's my natural color.

329
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:27,149
Where's your first-aid kit?

330
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,384
Upstairs.

331
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:31,553
Look at that.
It's a work of art.

332
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:32,688
Thanks.

333
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,059
What are you doing?!

334
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,827
Come on, Ben, we're the same.
I can tell.

335
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,829
You play the role
of the dutiful househusband,

336
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:44,632
but you like having that cock
sucked often and well.

337
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,367
I can do that.

338
00:15:46,434 --> 00:15:47,368
Four minutes. No one will know.

339
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,602
I'm not gay.

340
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,238
Neither was I until I got head
from a guy.

341
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:51,706
No.

342
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:53,041
No.

343
00:15:57,314 --> 00:16:00,150
Sorry. It's just...
been a long time for me.

344
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:06,490
Don't tell Chad, okay?

345
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:10,260
We're not doing well.

346
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:11,494
Your husband seems very...

347
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:12,629
Handsome?

348
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,898
Nervous.

349
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:17,334
I don't know.
It's just a feeling I get.

350
00:16:17,402 --> 00:16:20,704
Um... darkness.

351
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,909
Seems like you and Pat are
having problems.

352
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:28,146
Yeah. He can't keep his dick in
his pants.

353
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:31,884
You caught him cheating?

354
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:35,287
Yes. I'm a sneak and a snoop.

355
00:16:35,355 --> 00:16:36,655
How?

356
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:38,223
It's easy.

357
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,226
Cell phone records.

358
00:16:41,294 --> 00:16:43,829
You can delete a text,
but you can't erase the bill.

359
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,168
Vivien, that bat is terrible.
Let me finish it.

360
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,723
Trick or treat, smell my feet,
give me something good to eat.

361
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,459
Addy!
I want to be a pretty girl for Halloween.

362
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:14,860
You want what?

363
00:17:14,928 --> 00:17:17,529
Make me a pretty girl
like you, Violet.

364
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,236
I'm actually not
very good at this.

365
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:25,204
I don't care.

366
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:26,772
I'll like it.

367
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,940
Close your eyes.

368
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,977
How old are you, Addy?

369
00:17:32,045 --> 00:17:34,547
A lady never reveals her age.

370
00:17:34,614 --> 00:17:37,016
Is Tate your boyfriend?

371
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,151
Wait. You know Tate?

372
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:41,922
I talk to him when he comes here
for his head shrinking.

373
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:43,657
He likes you, I can tell.

374
00:17:43,724 --> 00:17:45,392
He thinks you're a pretty girl.

375
00:17:49,564 --> 00:17:51,064
Are you a virgin?

376
00:17:51,131 --> 00:17:53,066
Yes.

377
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,234
Aren't you?

378
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:55,168
Hell no.

379
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,540
You can't keep breaking
into our house, Addy.

380
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:03,409
But I like it here.

381
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:04,644
My friends are here.

382
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:10,951
Wow! Violet, I'm beautiful!

383
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:16,958
Goddamn it, come here!

384
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,660
Now, who did that to your face?!
Violet!

385
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,696
Violet, that girl's got
another cupcake coming.

386
00:18:21,764 --> 00:18:24,299
Now wash that smut
off your face!

387
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,234
No! I wanna be a pretty girl!

388
00:18:26,302 --> 00:18:29,437
Well, you're not a pretty girl
and you know it!

389
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:30,472
But I wanna be!

390
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,073
"Oh, put her in a home,"

391
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:34,108
they said. Even Daddy.
But no, I couldn't do that.

392
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,376
I don't want to be Snoopy!

393
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,910
I want to be a pretty girl!

394
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:41,448
Do you know what they think when
we walk down the street?!

395
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:44,084
"There but for the grace
of God go I."

396
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,219
You make them feel lucky.

397
00:18:46,287 --> 00:18:48,789
And they think I'm a hero.

398
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,758
As though I've had some choice!

399
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:53,427
No, wait!

400
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,567
Tate?

401
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,805
Tate?

402
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:05,408
You said she wanted
to meet at midnight.

403
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,712
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

404
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:20,323
You asshole!

405
00:19:20,391 --> 00:19:21,858
I scared you.

406
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:23,894
No, you didn't.

407
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,529
Where'd you get this thing?

408
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:26,864
My dad threw it out.

409
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,365
Finders keepers.

410
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:33,971
Really?
I didn't scare you?

411
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:36,674
I said no.

412
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,908
I bet I can.

413
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,247
You have to put your fingers
on the other side.

414
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,949
I don't believe in that shit.

415
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,284
Charles is gonna answer

416
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,453
all your questions.
He used to live here.

417
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,155
Is Charles going to tell me

418
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,556
what happened to those assholes

419
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,990
that tried to kill us?

420
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,258
What'd you do to them?

421
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,559
I told you
I didn't do anything.

422
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,794
I had some help.

423
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,567
What's in this basement?
I want the truth.

424
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:07,437
What I'm about to tell you
might scare you...

425
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,538
to death.

426
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:09,873
I can take it.

427
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,043
Dr. Charles Montgomery built
this house.

428
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,747
And here in this basement
is where he worked.

429
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,750
Charles was a doctor
to the stars,

430
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,287
<i>but he was also drug addict,</i>
<i>and his wife Nora wasn't gonna</i>

431
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,290
<i>let that get in the way</i>
<i>of her lifestyle.</i>

432
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,159
<i>So she set up a little secret</i>
<i>side business;</i>

433
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,994
<i>he would take care of</i>
<i>girls who didn't want</i>

434
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,762
<i>to be in trouble anymore.</i>

435
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,099
<i>This went on and on until one</i>
<i>day, one girl couldn't keep</i>

436
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,402
<i>the secret to herself,</i>

437
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,137
<i>and she told her boyfriend</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

438
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,809
Montgomery residence.
Whoever this is it's past 10:00.

439
00:20:42,877 --> 00:20:44,411
You shouldn't be calling
at this hour.

440
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,912
An eye for an eye.

441
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,381
Who is this?

442
00:20:47,448 --> 00:20:49,516
A tooth for a tooth.

443
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,018
I won't tolerate this nonsense
any longer unless...

444
00:20:56,023 --> 00:20:59,391
Charles, I've just had the most
peculiar conversation.

445
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,270
Charles...?

446
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:13,840
Oh, my God...

447
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,308
Charles!

448
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:18,344
Charles!

449
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:21,381
The boyfriend wanted revenge,

450
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,516
so he kidnapped Charles'
and Nora's baby.

451
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,685
Terrified, the Doctor

452
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:28,222
and his wife waited
for the ransom demands.

453
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,623
<i>This is your fault, Charles.</i>

454
00:21:35,896 --> 00:21:38,698
What is the meaning of this?

455
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,781
Charles? What is it, Charles?

456
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,749
Madame, there's no need for you
to see this.

457
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,619
<i>Driven insane by grief, the</i>
<i>doctor used all his experience</i>

458
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,820
<i>and surgical skills to try</i>
<i>and cheat death.</i>

459
00:22:03,888 --> 00:22:07,124
I want to bury our son in this.

460
00:22:14,865 --> 00:22:17,867
Charles?

461
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:20,303
What are you doing?

462
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,841
What have you done
to our baby?!

463
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:32,951
But what he created was ungodly,
and monstrous.

464
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,620
And even after their tragic end,

465
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,860
that "thing" remained,
down here, to this day.

466
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:41,795
Oh my God...

467
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:46,166
You are so full of shit.

468
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,034
I don't believe a word that
has come out of your mouth.

469
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,003
Forget it.
Forget I ever asked.

470
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:53,373
And I'm tired that
we keep hanging out

471
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:55,842
in this dark, dank place.

472
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,479
Why can't we go somewhere,
like on a real date?

473
00:23:01,033 --> 00:23:02,530
All right.

474
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,152
Tomorrow night.

475
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:07,653
We'll go out.

476
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,468
Your father agreed
to see me again,

477
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:13,926
but I'm not supposed to be here.

478
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:16,761
Come on, I'll be your lookout.

479
00:23:39,034 --> 00:23:39,882
Wow.

480
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,969
There's so many different
flavors, it's freaky.

481
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:43,604
I don't know half of them.

482
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,672
What did we say?

483
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,175
No eating until we
inspect 'em at home!

484
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:53,481
She reminds you of Violet,
doesn't she?

485
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:55,951
<i>Violet?</i>

486
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:58,286
Wow...

487
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,235
Oh, I'm so scared!
You look amazing.

488
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:05,326
She had to be scary.
My fierce little girl.

489
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:06,894
Just like her mom.

490
00:24:08,897 --> 00:24:12,366
Smart and beautiful...

491
00:24:12,434 --> 00:24:14,968
no need to be like anyone else.

492
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:22,143
The thing is, I was a...
I was a troubled kid, too.

493
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,411
I was kinda like you, Tate.

494
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,418
I didn't hold out too
much hope for myself.

495
00:24:29,485 --> 00:24:31,520
Not many other
people did, either.

496
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:35,156
It was a total shock to
everyone, including myself,

497
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,558
when I became a doctor.

498
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,961
But somehow I was given this...

499
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:44,765
amazing gift of family.

500
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:54,540
Hey, it's gonna be
okay, Dr. Harmon...

501
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:57,911
I'm sorry. Oh, God.

502
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:02,182
I'm sorry, Tate.

503
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:05,853
Addy? Addy?

504
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:10,192
Well, where's your costume?

505
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,628
I'm not trick-or-treating
this year. I'm too old.

506
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:15,997
It's Halloween! Everyone gets a
chance to be someone else,

507
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:18,299
let their hair down for awhile.

508
00:25:18,367 --> 00:25:21,269
I thought you wanted to be
a pretty girl.

509
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,672
Hmm?

510
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,712
Hmm?

511
00:25:33,347 --> 00:25:35,216
Ta-dah!

512
00:25:38,186 --> 00:25:43,224
And now you don't have to worry
about makeup or anything like that.

513
00:25:45,094 --> 00:25:49,331
Come on, let me see you smile.

514
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:52,802
Come on, little honeybear.
Let me see you smile.

515
00:25:55,338 --> 00:25:58,874
Okay? Let's go see if Mama's got
any clothes that'll fit you.

516
00:25:58,942 --> 00:26:00,942
Come on.

517
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,377
Maybe one of my old
maternity dresses.

518
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,084
Have you seen my... my fangs?

519
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,421
Ah...

520
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,857
Fangs a lot!

521
00:26:19,027 --> 00:26:21,561
Oh, come on, Viv, you're the
one who wanted to do this.

522
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,163
Can you at least try
to enjoy it?

523
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,831
How's Hayden?

524
00:26:24,898 --> 00:26:26,132
What?

525
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,901
I swear to Christ, Ben.

526
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:33,005
I told you if you lied to me one
more time...

527
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,407
that we're done.

528
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:40,814
I can't do this.

529
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:41,515
I can't do this.
Vivien...

530
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:43,217
Viv?

531
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,253
I read through the phone bills.

532
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:48,557
Her number is on there
20 times-- more.

533
00:26:48,624 --> 00:26:50,993
Yeah. Because I don't answer.

534
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,596
And when she does get me, I tell
her not to call back.

535
00:26:53,663 --> 00:26:56,231
Did you see her in Boston?
Vivien, no.

536
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,267
She keeps calling,
harassing me.

537
00:26:58,335 --> 00:27:00,102
I told her I'd call the police
if she doesn't stop.

538
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,170
And did she?

539
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:03,272
Yeah.

540
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:06,409
She won't be calling back.

541
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,278
Well, she might, 'cause I left
her a message.

542
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,085
Well, I wouldn't expect
a call back.

543
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:17,219
I was pretty forceful.

544
00:27:19,255 --> 00:27:23,824
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but...

545
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,796
after everything that happened,
after the-the break-in, I-I...

546
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,132
I didn't want to
add more stress.

547
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:32,800
Hey, you had

548
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:37,905
every right to react exactly
the way you did.

549
00:27:37,973 --> 00:27:40,241
But believe me--

550
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,578
Hayden is over.

551
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,756
It's Hayden.

552
00:27:57,727 --> 00:28:00,496
I'll call her back.

553
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,403
What is that racket?

554
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,740
The spooky sounds of Hallow...

555
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:12,542
Really?
What?

556
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,112
Let's see. The first impression
that anyone is going to have,

557
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,648
before they ever experience
my meticulously-appointed

558
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:19,649
candy/scare station
is of you going

559
00:28:19,717 --> 00:28:22,919
to the front door in
that Rite Aid witch outfit.

560
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:24,988
Ugh!

561
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:29,525
But never fear, Count Chocula's
here to really add some class.

562
00:28:29,593 --> 00:28:30,693
What's the matter?

563
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:33,629
He doesn't like our costumes.

564
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,698
Well, there's nothing that can
be done about it now.

565
00:28:35,766 --> 00:28:39,369
The doorbell's gonna be ringing, and we
still have to decorate the bobbing station.

566
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:44,909
What the hell is this?

567
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:46,344
What?

568
00:28:46,412 --> 00:28:48,213
Chad?
Gala apples.

569
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,682
We specifically talked about
Granny Smiths.

570
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,019
They didn't have any Granny
Smiths at Gelson's.

571
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,754
Then you go to the
farmer's market

572
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:57,490
or an off ramp in Valencia and
you buy a bag from Pedro.

573
00:28:57,558 --> 00:28:58,925
Where's the effort?

574
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:00,560
I think you're overreacting.

575
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:02,595
Because I'm the only one who
actually gives a shit?

576
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:05,198
I think you should just leave.

577
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:07,834
You think we should
just leave our house?

578
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,903
It's not your house.

579
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:14,641
We know it, you know it
and the house knows it.

580
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,576
Frankly, you don't deserve it.

581
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:17,978
Get out!

582
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:18,813
Yeah, leave.

583
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,681
We are not leaving this house.

584
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:22,216
Get out!

585
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:23,951
Get out! Get out!

586
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:26,921
I don't care about any of this.
Just go!

587
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:29,857
You shouldn't have
to watch this.

588
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,892
Get out of here!

589
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:37,698
Are you okay?

590
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,569
I don't believe you, Ben.

591
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:44,071
You tell me your story,

592
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:47,907
but there's a little glimmer in
your eye, a little...

593
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:52,879
lie, a little darkness.

594
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:56,449
And I don't want to live
with suspicion anymore,

595
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:59,119
so I want you to go.

596
00:30:00,788 --> 00:30:03,090
I want you to go.

597
00:30:06,028 --> 00:30:07,929
Oh, God.
Aah!

598
00:30:07,997 --> 00:30:09,030
What's wrong?

599
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,133
Aah!
What is it?

600
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:12,701
It feels like the baby's
kicking.

601
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,470
That's impossible. It's only
eight weeks old.

602
00:30:14,537 --> 00:30:16,071
Okay.

603
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:18,874
I got to go to the hospital.
What's going on?

604
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:20,409
Stay here,
and don't answer the door.

605
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:22,712
- Don't answer the door?
- It's Halloween.

606
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,655
Trick or treat.

607
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:58,857
It says "Take One."
Can't you read?

608
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:02,384
I'm a pretty girl.
I want Violet to see.

609
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:05,173
Shortbus!

610
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,005
Hey!

611
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:18,008
Wait for me!

612
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,348
No, no, no,
not his face, that's fake.

613
00:31:56,468 --> 00:31:57,945
He broke his leg.

614
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,218
Sorry to keep you waiting.

615
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:04,488
Are you presently feeling any
pain in the abdominal area?

616
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,557
I just feel really sick.
I haven't been feeling any of

617
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,793
the... the kicking since we left
home about a half hour ago.

618
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,829
Well, I'm sure it's not kicks
that you're feeling.

619
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:13,831
The baby's only the size of a
kidney bean at eight weeks.

620
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,432
I know. That's-that's why I'm
concerned.

621
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,834
I think... I feel like
there's something wrong.

622
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:18,569
Well, I'm sure it's just gas.

623
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:22,240
So let's just take a look, and make
sure that everything is perfect.

624
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,909
Okay...

625
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,212
And you're sure about
the time line?

626
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,381
Yeah, eight weeks. Positive.

627
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,916
The baby seems to be
a lot bigger.

628
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,717
Okay, here we go...

629
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,063
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

630
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,598
I'm gonna get some help.

631
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,574
What's going on?
What's going on?

632
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:55,609
Oh, my God!

633
00:32:55,677 --> 00:32:57,110
Oh, my God!

634
00:32:57,178 --> 00:32:58,778
Oh, my God. Oh, my baby.

635
00:32:58,846 --> 00:32:59,779
Oh, my...

636
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,915
Oh! What happened?

637
00:33:01,983 --> 00:33:04,351
What happened? What happened?!

638
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:05,985
She just walked
into the street.

639
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,620
It was a
hit-and-run, ma'am.

640
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:08,621
Oh, no! Oh...

641
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:10,056
Is she dying?

642
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:11,558
We're doing everything we can.

643
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,992
Okay. You gotta...

644
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,461
We gotta get her to the lawn
over there

645
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,096
while she's still with us.

646
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,165
Yeah. We need to take
her in, stabilize her...

647
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,268
No! If you can't help me,

648
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,836
then get out
of the goddamned way!

649
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,137
Ma'am, just... just let us...

650
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:26,573
No!

651
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,775
Addy, come on.

652
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,678
We're gonna get you home

653
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:33,447
with all your friends.

654
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:34,481
Come on, honey.

655
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,849
We're almost there.

656
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,751
Stay with me, Addy.

657
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,186
It's just a few more feet.

658
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:40,354
Aw, geez.

659
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:42,657
Oh, my God. Addy?

660
00:33:45,394 --> 00:33:46,794
Oh, no!

661
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:51,566
Oh... no.

662
00:33:51,633 --> 00:33:52,833
Oh...

663
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:36,245
Oh, Mother,

664
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:40,650
you always had the
most beautiful hands.

665
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,855
What have they done to you?

666
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,868
This is my fault.

667
00:34:57,936 --> 00:35:01,905
I wasn't there for you.

668
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,878
I'm so sorry.

669
00:36:13,311 --> 00:36:15,846
Come with me, baby.

670
00:36:15,913 --> 00:36:19,350
I want to, but I can't, Mother.

671
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:20,685
I can't.

672
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:46,379
My tenant Ben,
I want my money!

673
00:36:48,815 --> 00:36:51,282
I'm not leaving here

674
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,950
till I have my thousand dollars!

675
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:54,819
Hello!

676
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:56,086
Ben Harmon!

677
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,592
Ben Harmon!

678
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,828
I am not leaving here
till I have thousand dollars.

679
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:04,829
Screw you!

680
00:37:04,897 --> 00:37:06,898
You owe me!

681
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:11,269
Oh, here, here.
Take one and go!

682
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,509
Come on, come on!

683
00:37:16,576 --> 00:37:17,743
Hey, honey.

684
00:37:17,811 --> 00:37:19,144
Dad, there's some freaky dude

685
00:37:19,212 --> 00:37:20,679
at the door
screaming about money.

686
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:23,248
I think he might be one of
your patients. I don't know,

687
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:24,882
should I call the cops?
No! No. Just...

688
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,217
just keep the door closed.

689
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,218
Is it locked?

690
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,219
Yeah.

691
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:32,090
We're on way home right now.

692
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:35,093
Violet? Just...
just keep the door locked.

693
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,561
Oh, aha, oh.

694
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:39,497
I know you're in there.

695
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:40,832
Is that your daughter?

696
00:37:58,389 --> 00:37:59,422
Violet!

697
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,491
Violet!

698
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,526
Violet!

699
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:04,828
Violet!

700
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:05,896
Violet!

701
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:07,431
Violet?
Violet!

702
00:38:07,499 --> 00:38:08,833
Violet?

703
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,434
Ben!

704
00:38:10,502 --> 00:38:11,535
She's not here!

705
00:38:11,655 --> 00:38:13,472
Call her cell phone!

706
00:38:14,994 --> 00:38:25,799
