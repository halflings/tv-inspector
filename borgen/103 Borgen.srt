1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,194
All this can be yours.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,354
But power isn't a cute little lapdog.
You have to grab it and hold on to it.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,796
The only relevant question is:
Are you game?

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,633
Clear your desk.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,758
You got fired?
- No, I quit.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,675
Ole! Come on, damn you!
It's not funny.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,470
I loved him so much.
He had a bad heart.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,519
When is the funeral?
- Today.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,879
He was married. He had a wife
and two children. They didn't know.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,830
We're going
to support a different PM. Me.

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,757
3, 2, 1, go.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,756
Today, Denmark got
its first female prime minister.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,035
Here we are.
Denmark has got a new government.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,596
"Democracy is the worst way to run
a country - except for all the others. "

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,788
It took Nyborg's cabinet just two
months to negotiate the budget bill.

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,399
If the budget is passed in two days,
the PM will have passed her exam.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,078
Hanne Holm, political observer.
What's this all about?

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,358
The budget is
what makes Denmark tick.

19
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,071
If the budget bill falls,
so does the cabinet.

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,078
How did you carry through
the budget negotiations so fast?

21
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,438
Sometimes things just go your way.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,833
What are you going to change?
- I'm announcing it in 30 minutes.

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,839
Briefing with the Ministers for Finance,
Foreign Affairs and Climate in five.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,551
Press conference at 10. And at 11...

25
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,750
The meeting with Danish Industry.
- That's tomorrow.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,549
At 11 you're meeting with
the Director of the National Gallery.

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,315
She's going to help you
choose paintings for your office.

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,790
The PM always gets to choose.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,714
I want something more modern.
- At 12...

30
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,237
I need to concentrate
on the press conference now, Sanne.

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,315
Did she just curtsey?
- We'll get rid of her.

32
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,032
Nobody else wants her, you see.
- So the PM gets her.

33
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,830
We need your New Year's speech
in four days.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,596
And you need a new media adviser.
- I don't need a spin doctor.

35
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,196
Guess who's the new
editor-in-chief of the Express.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,035
Laugesen.
And he wants your head on a platter.

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,034
I didn't fire him.
His party did.

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,751
But who made PM instead of him?
He hates you, Birgitte.

39
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,158
Who's it from?

40
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,273
Hanne Holm is with the Express now.
They take all the undesirables.

41
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,351
Good morning.

42
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,952
I'm going to tell you
about the budget bill today.

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,274
The passing of this budget bill marks
a change of system in Denmark.

44
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,477
Any questions?
Hanne Holm.

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,871
Has the PM secured
a broad majority?

46
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,751
Unfortunately, the bill will be passed
with the narrowest majority possible.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,948
But how? Two Labour members have
just refused to vote for the bill.

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,270
What do you mean?

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,910
Parly Petersen and Vagn Fousing
won't vote for it.

50
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,709
Their press release looks genuine.

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,192
It looks like you just lost
your majority, Birgitte Nyborg.

52
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,352
GOVERNMENT
Episode 3- The Art of the Possible

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,072
I've never been so humiliated
in my life!

54
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,708
What's going on?
- I don't know.

55
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,510
Get them in line.
I want them to vote for it tomorrow.

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,719
Okay.
- My office in an hour.

57
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,438
Why are you going against party line?

58
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,559
It's just great that the PM
and her elitist friends -

59
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,632
want to help the poor in Africa.

60
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,236
But what about the poor in Denmark?

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,315
- Why this protest now?
- My conscience rules my vote.

62
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,190
Convene the Finance Council.
- We're meeting in an hour.

63
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,478
The press is all over us.
- They'll have to wait.

64
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,350
Who's going to deal with them?
- I'll hire a media adviser, okay?

65
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,435
Get the Party Secretary to help us.
Postpone the rest of my meetings.

66
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,232
Are you withdrawing the bill?
- No. We're sticking to the plan.

67
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,029
There's something fishy going on.

68
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,512
Why didn't they raise
their objections earlier?

69
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,878
It's an ambush.
- What are your options?

70
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:58,593
Is this a test? 1. Marrot gets
them in line. The bill is passed.

71
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,718
2. They demand concessions,
we comply.

72
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,590
3. We withdraw the bill
and lose all credibility.

73
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,548
Yup. And we're not the first ones
to reach that conclusion.

74
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,554
Laugesen just commented
on the situation on Express TV.

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,477
The Director of the National Gallery.
- I told you to cancel my meetings.

76
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:27,352
Tell her to pick something modern.
Something modern, Sanne.

77
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,750
I want a new secretary.

78
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,278
The PM is not up to thejob.
That's the plain and simple of it.

79
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,911
She masters political correctness,
but is devoid of political flair.

80
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,039
This isn't a question of gender.
She's simply incompetent.

81
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,512
Express asks you:
Is Birgitte Nyborg the right PM?

82
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,639
You need a media adviser. Now.

83
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,878
Hi, beautiful.
We're co-workers now.

84
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm your new political analyst,
because I know Birgitte Nyborg.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,156
Congratulations. Can I just...
- Jesus, don't go overboard.

86
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,678
You're still mad at me because
of what happened at the funeral.

87
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,072
I forgive you, Kasper.
- Thanks.

88
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,350
You've been to hospital?
- Don't go through my stuff!

89
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,431
It stuck out.

90
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,072
It was just a routine screening
for cervical cancer, okay?

91
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,472
Katrine, what's up?

92
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,997
Nothing.

93
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,720
I have to get to make-up.

94
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,351
Why are you pushing yourself
when you feel like shit?

95
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,513
Look, I know you.
- Maybe you don't anymore.

96
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,270
3 YEARS EARLIER

97
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,591
Hey, save some for me.
- Nope.

98
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,716
Save some for me!

99
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,919
Hey! Ego.
- Ego?

100
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,152
I bet you haven't told
your parents about me.

101
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,279
Sure I've told Papa about you.

102
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,877
Papa? Oh, sweet prince,
how is Papa?

103
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,319
Why don't you call him 'dad'?
- He lives in France.

104
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,951
Okay, then.
So he lives there with Maman?

105
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,231
Mama. Oui.
Or Sandrine, as she's called.

106
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,188
How come you call her 'mom',
when she isn't your mom?

107
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,193
My real mom's dead.

108
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,275
So Mama is a housewife, and Papa
gets rich from making helicopters.

109
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,754
For the French army.
I don't want to talk about them.

110
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,390
When can I meet them?
- Soon.

111
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,916
You've been saying that
for six months.

112
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,756
You met my family.
- They live only a few hours away.

113
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,550
Mine lives in the South of France.
- We were supposed to meet at Easter.

114
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,111
Then during the summer.
And then... when?

115
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,319
Then during the fall... and winter.

116
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,031
I mean it. When can I meet them?
- I really mean it, too.

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,310
Come on, give me a kiss.
- No. When can I meet them?

118
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,075
Just a tiny kiss.
- Okay.

119
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,477
Didn't you want a kiss?
- I didn't say where.

120
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,278
I hear you want Tore Gudme from
Save the Children as your spin doctor?

121
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,114
Yes, he's in line with our policies.

122
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,956
Have you seen his CV? He's the
youngest professor of rhetorics ever.

123
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,476
Look, who would you rather
send into the ring?

124
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,952
Someone who can kick ass
or a professor of rhetorics?

125
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,875
Bjørn Marrot is here.
- Did you talk to Parly and Vagn?

126
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,559
I gave them an ultimatum.
But they're not bowing down.

127
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,757
They can't stay in your party, then.

128
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,040
They already resigned.
- They've gone independent?

129
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,194
NEWS EXTRA

130
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,754
The cabinet is losing its majority,
and the budget drama is escalating.

131
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,632
After Parly Petersen and Vagn Fousing
got a bawling out from their leader -

132
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,396
they have resigned from the Labour
Party and are now independent.

133
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,109
Stick to the script.
"Bawling out!"

134
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,990
She looks like shit.
- Get Tanja to dab her face.

135
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,308
When am I back on?
- In 28 seconds.

136
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,835
What's up?

137
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,908
What the hell are you doing?
You're on in 20.

138
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,072
Where is she?

139
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,279
Roll headlines
if she doesn't make it.

140
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,716
Is there anything I can do?
- No, I'm fine.

141
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:50,274
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, go.

142
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,716
The budget bill is not
the only political drama.

143
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,557
Former PM Lars Hesselboe
may still be subject to an inquiry -

144
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,874
- into his use of public funds
during his time in office.

145
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,191
Jesus! Well done.

146
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,799
Well, ask the AB Group
to come over tomorrow. See you.

147
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,431
There's a beautiful man
waiting outside. Tore Gudme.

148
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,716
Send him in, please.

149
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,599
Go ahead.
- Thanks.

150
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,799
Hello, Tore. Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

151
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,159
I am aware of the urgency.
- Sit down.

152
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,834
I know you hold
a very important position -

153
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,755
but I'd still like to ask you...
if you'd...

154
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,117
I get your drift.

155
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,876
This job is confidential, and you want
a simple yes or no from me.

156
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,272
If I answer yes,
I'll drop everything and start at once.

157
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,195
What do you need?
- A media adviser.

158
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,115
Spin doctor.
- Yes, but not a "prince of darkness".

159
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,239
I won't let my spin doctor
control my policies.

160
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,075
My spin doctor controls the press.

161
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,439
I could sell myself for hours,
but you don't have time for that.

162
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,558
You obviously
know my qualifications.

163
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,635
I believe in you as a person
and in your political message.

164
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,749
Do you regard that as a prerequisite
to being a good spin doctor?

165
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,038
I guess that depends
on how professional you are.

166
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,237
I have no desire
to be that professional.

167
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,349
I have a question.
I've read your CV.

168
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,877
Impressive. The youngest Danish
associate professor of rhetorics ever.

169
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,873
Educated at Harvard and Princeton.

170
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,191
You've always played
on the winning team.

171
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,478
How are you going
to deal with adversity?

172
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,269
Analysis, consequence, execution.

173
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,115
I know it's short notice,
and you need to think it over.

174
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,317
I have. My answer is yes.

175
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,756
Can you start next week?

176
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,754
You need me tomorrow at 8.

177
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,390
Make that 7:30.
- Deal.

178
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,676
Thanks.

179
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,755
Hi, honey.
There goes my new spin doctor.

180
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,993
You hired him for his looks, or...?
- Hi.

181
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,759
Great to see you.
Are you out for stroll?

182
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,677
Oh, my God, Christmas presents!
That's going to be tough.

183
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,914
Hi, Laura and Magnus. Would you
like to see the Hall of Mirrors?

184
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,914
The budget bill's pure chaos.
- Just like back home.

185
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,633
Your bodyguards invaded the garage.
Our bikes now go in the greenhouse.

186
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,270
The two independents haven't
confirmed the meeting.

187
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,116
Give me an hour. One hour.
- One hour!

188
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,436
That's just great, baby.

189
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,238
Magnus and I are off
on a secret errand.

190
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,791
Well, Laura and I are off
on a top secret errand, too.

191
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,554
See you.

192
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,393
Think we conned them?

193
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,473
That way?
- I made a list.

194
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,918
I knew you wouldn't be prepared.
- You're a sweetheart.

195
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,475
Magnus' list is huge.
He's getting expensive habits.

196
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,713
I'm sure they can wait.
- Go ahead, Mom.

197
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,239
Sejrø speaking.
The independents are waiting for us.

198
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,153
I'm on my way.

199
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,478
I have to go.
- I thought you said an hour.

200
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,279
Yes, and I'm really sorry.

201
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,600
Just go, Mom.

202
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,112
See you.
- Isn't Mom coming?

203
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,239
No, Mom's got a budget bill
to salvage.

204
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,029
Okay, let's go Christmas shopping.

205
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,995
Thank you.
- They're waiting.

206
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,199
What is your offer?
- A couple of million for pensioners.

207
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,798
I'm not going to cut back on
development aid or other key issues.

208
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,875
A couple of independents aren't going
to make me change my policies.

209
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,919
We appreciate your concern
for the pensioners -

210
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,278
so we've found
another DKK 210m for them.

211
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,389
You've done your utmost
to humor us, obviously.

212
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,232
Yes.

213
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,916
But I have another issue
of great concern to me.

214
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,552
And politics is all about
seizing the day.

215
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,109
What are we talking about?

216
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,750
A motorway to Ringkøbing.

217
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,071
Thank you for coming.
We'll be in touch.

218
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,795
They're insane.
But I'll see what I can do.

219
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,589
Maybe we don't need them.
That was Hesselboe.

220
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,469
The Liberals and
the New Conservatives want to meet.

221
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,713
When?
- Now. You, me, Hesselboe, Yvonne.

222
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,672
Forget development aid. They want
funds for the police and the military.

223
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,991
I'm not going to revise
the budget bill now.

224
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,233
If Hesselboe patronizes me,
I'm out of there.

225
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,518
Let me do the talking.
- Someone has to wake her up.

226
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,998
What an unexpected call.
- We don't support your policies.

227
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,995
But I don't want you to bring about
a crisis of Italian dimensions, either.

228
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,072
You lost your majority.

229
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,473
As long as I don't have a majority
against me, that doesn't matter.

230
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:53,194
You could rely on the independents.
- And base your budget on traitors.

231
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,989
They have neither morals nor brains.

232
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,073
You want to save the cabinet?
- If you're willing to negotiate.

233
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,758
We can't live with certain elements of
your politically correct little budget.

234
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,629
I call it social responsibility.

235
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,351
Let's not get emotional.
I've drawn up a proposal.

236
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,993
We want the first press conference.
- Give Birgitte time to look it over.

237
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,355
Let me guess.

238
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,833
Tax breaks, more police and military,
less green taxes -

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,037
and clamp-downs
on juvenile offenders.

240
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,431
Yes, we demand concessions.

241
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,592
Denmark has a new government.

242
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,672
We are not pursuing
a right-wing policy.

243
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,278
A government pursues the policy
necessary to its survival.

244
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,159
Think it over.

245
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,871
Lars, the answer is no.

246
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,158
I won't go down in history as the PM
who merely sat in for the Liberals.

247
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,950
The alternative might be
not to go down in history at all.

248
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,791
Negotiation was an option.
- These were ultimate demands.

249
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,272
Hesselboe wanted to come off as
the great saviour of the budget bill.

250
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,228
Our only options are Parly and Vagn.

251
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,238
Go home. I'll talk to Parly. I won't
give them more than necessary.

252
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,592
Am I a complete idiot?

253
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,031
Maybe.
But you're the bravest idiot I know.

254
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,472
Are you still PM?

255
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,189
Two days ago I had a budget bill.

256
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,956
Now, we're negotiating with two crazy
independents about a motorway.

257
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,555
Will it secure your majority?
- Yes.

258
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,679
Then give them their motorway.
- To secure the peace?

259
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,276
The kids want
to spend Christmas with you.

260
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,433
Even if it'll cost me
a motorway to the sticks?

261
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,912
Are they mad at me
for not tucking them in?

262
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,471
You promised Magnus a bedtime story.
He wouldn't let me read him one.

263
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,791
He's asleep,
and he'll get over it.

264
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,909
Would the PM like to help me
wrap the presents?

265
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,918
I managed to distract Magnus enough
to keep Santa alive for another year.

266
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,155
I promise to give them
a great Christmas.

267
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,677
And I'll do all the hard work.
- No, you won't.

268
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,308
Yes, you will.

269
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,312
We're still us, aren't we?

270
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,875
Good morning.
- The Minister for Finance is waiting.

271
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,715
The National Gallery wants
to know what style...

272
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,678
The Director decides, okay?

273
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,469
Good morning.
You slept here?

274
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,829
I haven't slept. The motorway issue
won't be solved before the vote.

275
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,515
Ask the President of the Parliament
to postpone the vote.

276
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:57,596
The Bulldog? She hates me.
- The Bulldog is your only option.

277
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,269
She won't postpone the vote.

278
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,399
We stand to get a vote of censure.
- This isn't Italy.

279
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,509
Parliament is split. Securing the
majority is all anyone thinks about.

280
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,834
So get me the majority.
- We can't agree on the motorway.

281
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,030
The Greens are against, because
it runs through a wading bird habitat.

282
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,273
I bet Amir puts his own survival
as minister before the birds'.

283
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,275
Solidarity is against, too.
We don't have a majority.

284
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,796
That motorway was dropped
a while back.

285
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,239
Why is Parly re-opening the issue?
- His constituency is up there.

286
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,190
Let's leak to the press that Parly
doesn't care about the pensioners.

287
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,673
All he wants is a motorway.
- Leaking confidential talks is unfair.

288
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,756
I bet Parly withdraws his demand.
- We're about to be outvoted.

289
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,878
I think we're past fair play.

290
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,919
Do it.
- Okay.

291
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,549
Let's see how far along you are.

292
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,271
Please unbutton your pants
and pull up your top.

293
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,159
Let's see if we can get an image.

294
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,835
Let's see if we can see anything.

295
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,516
Yes, there's your baby.

296
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,919
What's that flashing?
- The little heart.

297
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,153
I can print out
a picture for the father.

298
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,471
Do you want that?
- Please.

299
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,797
He really wanted to come today.
- He can come with you next time.

300
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,279
Our source tells us
you have new demands.

301
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,433
Now you want a motorway
to Ringkøbing.

302
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,275
Yesterday you wanted
to help pensioners.

303
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,989
Voters are getting confused.

304
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,188
Not once they see how this motorway
benefits pensioners in particular.

305
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,557
Please elaborate.

306
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,669
Do you know how long it takes
to get an ambulance in that region?

307
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,196
Three times as long as here.
- Oh, come on!

308
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,876
One could get the idea you'rejust
trying to please your constituents.

309
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,350
Tell that to 5-year-old Anna
and her family.

310
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,069
Her granddad had a stroke
and needed an ambulance.

311
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,472
The old main road was blocked by
traffic, so he died in the ambulance.

312
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,670
Had there been a motorway, he'd
have spent Christmas with Anna.

313
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,359
The PM wants to treat people from
developing countries as our equals.

314
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,674
Why is a Danish granddad worth less
than a person from Somalia, then?

315
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,389
I'll pass that question on to the PM.

316
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,394
Tame journalism!
Parly's arguments don't hold up.

317
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:36,192
Parly just won popular opinion
because Anna misses her granddad.

318
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,352
HESSELBOE INQUIRY PENDING

319
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,877
How will we survive the vote?
- Blackmail.

320
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,073
I see you kept the paintings.
- They're about to be changed.

321
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,472
Your budget bill
is causing you trouble.

322
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,953
I need a week.
- A vote of censure could topple you.

323
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,716
I'm the only realistic
cabinet leader at the moment.

324
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,271
And you don't think
I could make PM again?

325
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,639
Yes, and I'm offering you
just that chance.

326
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,430
You have an inquiry looming.

327
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,309
They won't find anything.
- I'm sure they won't.

328
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,995
But right now
you're a potential embezzler.

329
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,948
That bars you from becoming PM.
- What do you want?

330
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,750
Without the Moderates there won't be
a majority in favor of an inquiry.

331
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,994
I'll vote against the inquiry, if you
vote for a postponement of my bill.

332
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,072
Give me a week's respite.

333
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,189
Neither I nor the New Conservatives
will vote for your budget.

334
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,239
Can you speak
for the entire opposition?

335
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,952
Yvonne's been at my beck and call
the past six years. That won't change.

336
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,430
I'm asking for a week, that's all.

337
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,796
Yes?
- You don't answer your phone.

338
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,957
Maybe I want to be alone.
- I just want to see if you're okay.

339
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,791
Why do you want to be alone?
- I'm working.

340
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,239
I'm going back home for Christmas.

341
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,393
Is that what you want?
- You're going to France?

342
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,714
No, Mama and Papa are
in French Polynesia. Bora Bora.

343
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,317
It's their new thing.
- Don't they ever miss Denmark?

344
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,632
What's to miss in Denmark?
- You.

345
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,110
Mama and Papa aren't
the sentimental kind.

346
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm going to eat Christmas dinner
at the St. Petri Hotel. Want to come?

347
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,712
I've got my family, Kasper.
Remember?

348
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,795
They live in the sticks
where it smells of Ajax and dung.

349
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,671
But that's okay.
You can come, if you're alone.

350
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,678
I'm not alone. I was joking.
I'm going to my uncle's in Skodsborg.

351
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,594
He's invited at least 25 people.
It'll be great.

352
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,512
I'm pregnant.

353
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,433
Excuse me?

354
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,636
I'm pregnant.

355
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,672
No shit? Who's the father?
- Ole.

356
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,711
But you can't be.
- We didn't take any precautions.

357
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,114
It's none of my business anyway.
I guess you're going to get rid of it.

358
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,909
No.
- You can't have a child now.

359
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,833
Why not?

360
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,516
You can't handle a child right now.
You just made anchor on TV1.

361
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:05,800
Listen to yourself. We're talking
about a child, the fruit of our love!

362
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,750
You can have lots of children later.
- Yes, but not with him!

363
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,276
Katrine!

364
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,159
3 YEARS EARLIER

365
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,915
Sorry I'm late.
What's so important?

366
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,393
Who are you? Who are you?
Your dad's name is Peter Juul.

367
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,189
There's no Peter Juul
working for Eurocopter.

368
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,718
Your mom isn't buried in Slagelse.
- Talk about investigative journalism!

369
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,395
You lied to me!
- I didn't!

370
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,189
I just left out some of the details.
- Then fill me in.

371
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,875
My dad took his new wife's name.

372
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:02,149
He works for the French army who are
not about to divulge any information.

373
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,869
Even I don't know what the man does.

374
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,160
My mom... is buried
in an unmarked grave.

375
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,994
My mom committed suicide
when I was three.

376
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,791
I'm sorry, baby.

377
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,272
Let's go.
Are you coming?

378
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,637
The cabinet avoided
being outvoted today -

379
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,351
when the Liberals voted
for postponing the budget bill.

380
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:48,073
Parliament will convenejust after
Christmas. Kasper Juul, welcome.

381
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,870
You used to work for Birgitte Nyborg
as her spin doctor. What's going on?

382
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,032
The PM is under heavy fire.

383
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:02,435
Parliament is split, but Birgitte just
secured herself six more days.

384
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,718
How did Nyborg
win over the Liberals?

385
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,429
I think we're looking at a horse-trade.

386
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,755
Nyborg declared on the news at 12
she saw no reason -

387
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,629
for an inquiry to be held
into Hesselboe's doings.

388
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,669
She gets six more days to negotiate,
and he's off the hook.

389
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,400
In other words: Quid pro quo.

390
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,236
Hey, I've been Christmas shopping
for 11 minutes.

391
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,870
My bodyguards chose hubby's gift.
- Did you see this?

392
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,508
GIVE DENMARK A NEW PM

393
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,309
Did you see Tore's brilliant reply
to Laugesen in the paper?

394
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,711
Laugesen is turning
the people against you.

395
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,919
Your spin doctor fights back
with his pen. He can't protect you!

396
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,154
Then my results will have to protect
me. What do you want me to do?

397
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,632
I work around the clock.
We've lost our majority.

398
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,554
You're fishing for sympathy?
You're the PM, aren't you?

399
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,635
Are you going to resign?
- No way!

400
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,839
I'll be damned if I'll resign
before we've even gotten started.

401
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,834
Let's find the money for that motorway
and get to work.

402
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,279
I believe in this, Bent.
- Put that in your New Year's speech.

403
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,715
Hello.
- Sorry.

404
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,839
Isn't Christmas the time
to apologize and all that crap?

405
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,390
That's not like you.
- It is Christmas Eve.

406
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,998
Are you at your uncle's?
- Are you partying with the Smurfs?

407
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,518
My brother went a little overboard
with the Christmas decorations.

408
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:22,232
The moron. He says he'll throw me
a spinster party if I don't marry soon.

409
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,710
You'd better get a move on then.
- Yeah.

410
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,158
Sure you're doing the right thing?
- Yes.

411
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,829
They're calling me now.
Coming!

412
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,073
Dinner's served. Take care.
- Merry Christmas.

413
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,152
Hi, Mom.

414
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,793
They didn't see me.

415
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,070
Why so stand-offish,
Phillip Christensen?

416
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,237
I saw your old spin guy, Kasper,
on TV the other day.

417
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:37,393
He was on to your deal
with Hesselboe.

418
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,588
Why didn't you make him your
new adviser instead of Gudme?

419
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,914
I don't want to work with Kasper.
He has no morals.

420
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,231
Since when
did a spin doctor need that?

421
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,632
He was a great campaign organizer.
In my world you choose the best one.

422
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,079
In my world you choose the right one.
And I choose you.

423
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,070
You could thank me for your present.
That pen cost a bundle.

424
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,994
Yeah, but you gave me one
just like it three years ago.

425
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,872
Oh, how mortifying.
How lousy of me.

426
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,953
Oh, come here, babe.
- I'm sorry.

427
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,350
It's okay.

428
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:37,115
Leave it. It's mine.
- It's your new friend, Tore Gudme.

429
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,151
Good morning, Tore.
- Did you see the Express?

430
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:48,269
Laugesen claims you and I are
having an affair. It's grotesque.

431
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,309
It's a vile mixture
of gossip and hate campaign.

432
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,393
But efficient. My neighbor asks
when I'm calling an election.

433
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,155
My mom thinks I'm getting a divorce.

434
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,437
Laugesen wants to meet us
in a live TV1 debate.

435
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,068
I'm game.
- No.

436
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,516
You're the PM.
He's an editor-in-chief.

437
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,878
You're not on the same level.
- I'll meet him.

438
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,591
The opposition will kill us for letting
a spin doctor take a political debate.

439
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,676
I'm not. I'm just going to respond
to his dirty attack on me.

440
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,516
If you cross that line,
all hell will break loose.

441
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,276
Laugesen is trying
to undermine Birgitte's credibility.

442
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,513
We have to make sure he fails.
That's the bottom line of it.

443
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,037
It's time to act.
- I agree.

444
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,510
I'll call TV1 right away.
Merry Christmas.

445
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:58,398
Laugesen is lethal.
Does Tore have any TV experience?

446
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,915
The guy is a professor of rhetorics.

447
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,757
I'll be there at six.
Check with Pia.

448
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,070
Brief me when I get there.

449
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:23,313
You are coming to Granddad's lunch
tomorrow, aren't you?

450
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,871
I have to do an important interview
tonight. My plane leaves in two hours.

451
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,749
You're letting Granddad down.
- I know.

452
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,198
Watch TV tonight at 20:30,
and you'll understand.

453
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:41,275
Weren't you sick last week?
- Yes, but it's nothing serious.

454
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,035
People die from stress.
- It's not stress.

455
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,796
You work all the time.
- It's not stress, Mom.

456
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,714
You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

457
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,879
You're pregnant.
My dear girl. How...

458
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,160
Almost 11 weeks.
- Why didn't you say?

459
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,153
Who's...
- Ole.

460
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,912
So the child hasn't got a father?
Ole's dead, Katrine.

461
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,516
You don't understand.
- What's to understand?

462
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,710
We're going to have a baby.
- No, you are. And you're alone.

463
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,791
Katrine, haven't you said
goodbye to him yet?

464
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,158
Why are you so hard on yourself?
- You want me to get rid of it.

465
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,393
I thought you believed in God.
- This has nothing to do with God.

466
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,270
You need to look after yourself.
- I have to go now.

467
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:04,831
Are you up to it? I can ask Ulrik...
- No way! I'm ready.

468
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,391
Have Tanja put some color
on your face. You're pale as a ghost.

469
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,997
And smile, Katrine. We're not
running a funeral home here.

470
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,074
What?
- You didn't tell him?

471
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,437
You want a baby,
but no one can know about it.

472
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:38,071
Is it because it's Ole's?
- Shut up!

473
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,279
Laugesen puts a picture of you
and the PM on the front page -

474
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,911
- with a headline
implying a flirt.

475
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,393
It's grotesque and unfounded.
It just goes to show -

476
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:57,554
- how low the Express is willing
to go to attack the PM.

477
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,430
The Express is a mishmash
of gossipmonger and people's court.

478
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,070
But we all know
what segment they cater to.

479
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,995
Watch your step!
- And what segment is that?

480
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,958
All the uninspired losers out there.

481
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,557
Oh, people who don't read
four foreign papers each day?

482
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,759
The Express appeals
to the lowest common denominator -

483
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,596
- by glorifying Parly Petersen
for criticizing development aid.

484
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,675
No politics!
- He has a right to speak his mind.

485
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,833
And doesn't the Express have
the right to criticize your PM?

486
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,516
I'd consider it a blessing if your
freedom of speech were curtailed.

487
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,194
No, no, no!

488
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:51,948
Are you, the PM's adviser, in favor
of curtailing freedom of speech?

489
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,513
Laugesen is using the paper
to promote his own political career.

490
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,513
His board ought to look into that.

491
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,708
The PM will look into the matter.
- Oh, shut up, Tore!

492
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,000
Are you threatening to have anyone
speaking out against the PM fired?

493
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,232
I'm afraid our time is up.

494
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,315
A shame, because I'd love to hear
about all these impending dismissals.

495
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,960
OLE DAHL
DEARLY MISSED

496
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,351
I know who you are.
You shouldn't be here.

497
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,119
There's something you should know.
- I don't want to know a thing!

498
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,158
Understand? He's my husband.

499
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,710
I want you to leave.
- I'm sorry.

500
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,316
Get the hell out of here!

501
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,633
2 YEARS EARLIER

502
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:43,355
Papa just got a call from Sydney
about a military conference -

503
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,433
the week we were supposed
to go and visit them.

504
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,390
Let's make it a winter visit instead.
- This isn't working.

505
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,350
You and I. It isn't working.
- What do you mean?

506
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:03,117
Kasper, I think you're wonderful,
but I don't believe anything you say.

507
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,670
I don't know what's fact
and what's fiction.

508
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,469
Things are never as you say.

509
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,474
Maybe you need to keep secrets.
- I don't need anything.

510
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:24,751
Okay, then. I just don't believe you.
And I don't believe in us, either.

511
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,153
I swear to you.
This is all a misunderstanding.

512
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,991
I don't think so.
I think this is what we are.

513
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,951
I haven't got any secrets.

514
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,518
It doesn't matter anymore,
because it's taken root in me now.

515
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,833
I think we love each other.
- I think so, too.

516
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,638
Good news. I got the six billion
for the motorway.

517
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,191
I've drawn up the terms.
- Impressive, Bent.

518
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:50,469
The press dubs Gudme an amateur.
- I fired him this morning.

519
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,553
That was a first for him.
- What are you going to do?

520
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,190
We're going to sell the motorway
to the independents -

521
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,636
and get that budget bill
passed tomorrow.

522
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:08,319
Who's going to handle the press?
Try calling a pro this time.

523
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,799
I have a meeting with the PM.
- I have to register you.

524
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,192
It's okay.
This way.

525
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,673
I'm impressed you found
the six billion for that motorway.

526
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,470
The cabinet parties and Solidarity
have come to terms.

527
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,679
The independents are on their way,
and then we'll close the deal.

528
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,549
Wrong.
- He's going to get his motorway.

529
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,032
Parly doesn't want a motorway.
He wants your resignation.

530
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,751
Parly is being used by someone
who's got it in for Birgitte.

531
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,835
Michael Laugesen?
- How much do we know about Parly?

532
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,915
Wasn't he nailed for embezzling
with his EU salaries?

533
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,200
Who saved him?
- Laugesen.

534
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,433
He made Parly go against party line?
- Sure.

535
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,755
When Laugesen resigned, he could
no longer help Parly. Parly's isolated.

536
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:21,314
He's not assigned any tasks.
He's finished in Danish politics.

537
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,838
So why not do a friend a favor
and get your 15 minutes of fame?

538
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,073
He's going to topple the cabinet
to return a favor?

539
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,473
I may be way out there,
but I think you should call him.

540
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,270
Parly speaking.
- This is Birgitte Nyborg.

541
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,560
Our meeting won't take long, because
you're going to get your motorway.

542
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,637
Let's not get our signals crossed.

543
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,510
We still have a large bridge to gap -

544
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,672
if I'm to vote for your bill.

545
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:10,198
I want a new hospital in Skjern.

546
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:16,230
I'll have to discuss that with
my cabinet. I'll get back to you.

547
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,754
The nerve of the guy!
And we can't do a thing.

548
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,756
Yes, we can.
- What?

549
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,710
We can do what we've stood for
the past 50 years.

550
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,954
Negotiate across the political center.
Let's enlist the New Conservatives.

551
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,398
We already tried to talk to them.
- We talked to them and the Liberals.

552
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:47,075
Yes, they're in cahoots.
- Are they?

553
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,710
Don't you see?
It would be a triumph for the cabinet.

554
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,792
The New Conservatives hate...

555
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,636
It would be a historic break
with bloc politics.

556
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,678
Be quiet.
- Meet her at Marienborg.

557
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,833
The old snob will love that.
- Hi, Yvonne. It's Nyborg.

558
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,828
Thank you for coming.
- I presume it's urgent.

559
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,879
Tomorrow I'm going
to postpone the budget bill -

560
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,589
and pass a temporary
appropriation act.

561
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,880
I want a broad conciliation across the
center with the New Conservatives.

562
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,190
Sit down.

563
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,115
Why should we refrain
from toppling you?

564
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:49,198
An new election would lead to chaos.
Dead against your party's policies.

565
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,750
Law and order.
God, King and country.

566
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:57,391
Let's break with political warring.
- There's a lot we don't agree on.

567
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,677
There's even more we agree on.
Tea?

568
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,954
I should have asked you to bring
some of your scrumptious cookies.

569
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,115
My support comes at a price.
- How much?

570
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,511
DKK 400m more to the police.
- Deal.

571
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,911
Another 600 million to the military.

572
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,835
As long as it's for equipment
and education, fine.

573
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,675
The industry doesn't like
the pollution tax.

574
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,515
We'll just have to help them
develop green technologies.

575
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,593
You haven't got the money.
Less that DKK 9b won't hack it.

576
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:47,028
Four billion.
- Eight.

577
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,432
Five.
- Seven.

578
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,752
Six billion. And I'm not
budging on development aid.

579
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,230
This is about principles,
not money.

580
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,551
Where will you get six billion?

581
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,429
From a motorway
we're not going to build after all.

582
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,277
Have we got a deal?
- Let me talk to Hesselboe first.

583
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,956
We have, after all, been
coalition partners for six years.

584
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,793
Well, he was right, then.

585
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,999
Hesselboe told me the other day
you were at his beck and call.

586
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:31,517
Oh, he did, did he?

587
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,113
Yesterday, the PM landed the budget
with the New Conservatives' vote.

588
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,628
Political observer Hanne Holm calls
it a decisive victory for Nyborg.

589
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:52,148
Not only did Nyborg get
her budget bill passed.

590
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,917
She managed to split the opposition
through solid political craftsmanship.

591
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,072
Thank you.

592
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,119
Are you staying on at Marienborg
after your New Year's speech?

593
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,115
Shit! The New Year's speech.
- I've drawn one up.

594
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,310
Is it good?

595
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,552
You look very sharp.
- Thanks.

596
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:27,034
Your choice of artwork
is interesting.

597
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,239
Well, it's modern.

598
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,791
Sanne, get me the Director
of the National Gallery at once.

599
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,117
Despite the crisis, Denmark is one of
the ten richest countries in the world.

600
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,239
Yet many criticize our wish
to double development aid -

601
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,790
instead of taking better care
of ourselves.

602
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,351
But I believe we take better care of
ourselves by taking care of others.

603
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,557
Let me explain.

604
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:19,269
For every 1,000 children
born in Denmark, 5 die.

605
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,159
In Afghanistan, over 200 die.

606
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,633
This inequity leads to despair,
it breeds war and terror.

607
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,951
So much for the
political security arguments.

608
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,672
The most important argument is that
200 dead children are 200 too many.

609
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:43,598
Everyone should be allowed
to see their children grow up.

610
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,993
I believe the meaning of life is
to pass it on.

611
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,959
Yes. Thank you.

612
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,275
Well done! Considering you're hung
over from New Year's Eve last night.

613
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,514
I may just vote for you next time.
- I want to show you something.

614
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,993
You wrote that speech? I thought
you were a cold-hearted bastard.

615
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:19,551
I am. But your wife pays me a bundle
to write that sentimental drivel.

616
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:25,636
Champagne!
- Great. Want a sip, sweetie?

617
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,634
I sent you a personal message
in the PM's New Year's speech.

618
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,155
An homage to life and babies...

619
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,633
I just had an abortion.
- I'm sorry.

620
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:58,398
How come we're never in sync?
- I have to go now. Happy New Year.

621
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,515
Kasper...

622
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,956
Here you are.
- Thanks.

623
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,395
You're good.
- Thanks.

624
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,318
