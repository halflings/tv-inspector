1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
We're all very professional.
We must admit when we're wrong.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,230
I became a politician because I know
what the world should be like.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,632
My father died.
- Really? Or did he move to France?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,955
You don't get it. If you told me
the truth, I would do anything for you.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,157
I went to the headhunter meeting.
They asked -

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,835
if I would be CEO
of Via Electronics.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,834
I'm sorry. You deserved that.
- I took thejob.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,839
"You won't know what hit you before
it's too late" - American Arms Maker

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,313
Congratulations, Phillip. Well done.
We'll miss you.

10
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,914
Here, honey.
- Thanks.

11
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,074
Now we, Phillip's students,
would like to say a few words.

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,959
We wrote a speech -

13
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:25,592
called 'Ten Things
We Will Miss about Phillip'.

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,876
Number 1. We will miss
your fantastic lectures.

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,512
Few people can make
international finance exciting -

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,114
but you could.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,515
Number 2. We will miss
how good your ass looks in jeans.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,118
Number 3. We will miss the
great expectations you have for us.

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,875
It has been extremely inspiring.

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,749
Yes, Kasper?
- When are you coming in?

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,313
Defense needs a press release
approved on the new fighters.

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,916
I'll be there in half an hour.
- Super.

23
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,110
All your support when we don't
know why we took this course.

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,990
And finally,
we'll miss your nice ass -

25
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,357
after we see it
for the last time -

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,799
but we're sure we'll see it again
on the front page of the newspapers.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,509
Congratulations.
A toast to Phillip.

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,314
Cheers. Thank you.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,552
Here is the press release
from Defense.

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
The ministries aren't pleased about
you approving all press releases.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,754
When was that rule adopted?
- While you were away.

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,070
That's incapacitation.

33
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,313
Höxenhaven held an unauthorized
conference about the wire tap -

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,156
and then Laugesen's book
caused embarrassing reverberations.

35
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,356
What does it say?

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,992
Hans Christian Thorsen recommends
the F26 Defender -

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,951
because it's the best on the market,
and our allies have chosen it.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,874
The total investment
has been raised by DKK 10bn...

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,194
Stop. 10 billion?
- Military hardware is expensive.

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,992
Could you be more specific?
- The total cost has risen.

41
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,550
But it's definitely
the right type of fighter.

42
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,239
No. The two other were cheaper.
Withhold the press release.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,030
The minister will have to account
for choosing the most expensive one.

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,795
Anders, give me the material
on all three fighters.

45
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,918
I'll go through them.

46
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,515
This won't go down well.

47
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,037
The Ministry of Defense
has struggled with this for a month.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,829
What's up with her?

49
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,829
GOVERNMENT
Episode 9- Divide and Rule

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,870
Today's top story is that we finally
figured out which fighter to buy.

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,717
The press release is on its way.
The Minister of Defense is coming in.

52
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,556
Katrine, are you prepared?
- Yes. It will be the F26 Defender.

53
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,110
That will give industry DKK 9bn
in orders.

54
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,397
I have to take this.
- What's your angle?

55
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,711
Is it the best one for pilots
or for business?

56
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,149
"I'm afraid of the big, strong men
and cars honking in traffic. "

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,997
Our approach isn't that Denmark
should be a demilitarized hick country.

58
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,436
I don't get it.
- There's another angle.

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,115
New fighters give Danish companies
big business.

60
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,670
Yes! Let's all be spin doctors.

61
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,072
Strike a balance between a conspiracy
theory and hooray forjournalism.

62
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,313
I need some kick-ass pictures.
- It'll be pure 'Top Gun'.

63
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,109
We need to interview pilots.
- I'm going to Skrydstrup.

64
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,071
I'll be in the cockpit.
- Congratulations. Perfect.

65
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,952
That was the Ministry of Defense.
There'll be no press release today.

66
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,511
Why not?
- The usual. Details to iron out.

67
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,753
Now what, Friis?
- Right. Now what?

68
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,754
We bump up the story
about the bank managers' salary.

69
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,434
How come you have time for lunch?

70
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,152
Because your Minister of Defense
can't decide which fighter to buy.

71
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,350
You're not surprised.
So the PM is involved?

72
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,275
I didn't say a word.
- She's awfully busy these days.

73
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,477
She is the PM.

74
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,635
"We're all very professional. "

75
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,510
That's a quote from your boss.
I watched the party leader debate.

76
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,276
You flipped
when she deviated from the script.

77
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,595
"I think we should be who we are.
We can still be good politicians. "

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,036
Does that still apply to her?
- Again, no comment.

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,957
What about your father?
Still no comment on that?

80
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,715
There's nothing to say.
He's dead.

81
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,920
You didn't say a word when he was
cremated. You haven't said a word.

82
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,669
People are often quiet
when they've lost someone.

83
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,549
I thought we should talk about it.
- No.

84
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,990
Your father was cremated in a chapel.
It was just you and me.

85
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,472
It's hard to believe
he was a big businessman in France.

86
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,997
Tell me about him.
- No.

87
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,189
Didn't you like him?

88
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,989
Did you?
Kasper, did you like your father?

89
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,594
My father was a nasty, little wuss.

90
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,993
He lived a boring life in Korsør.
A godforsaken city. That's it.

91
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:45,076
Why did you lie about him?
- Because I hated my life with him!

92
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,119
So I made up stories about a life
I would have preferred.

93
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,114
I've seen a psychologist.
I know all the interpretations.

94
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,955
I can't take any more.

95
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,670
'THE FUTURE OF THE MILITARY'
'DENMARK'S NEED FOR FIGHTERS'

96
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,436
Do you really have to read that?
- What?

97
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,519
Can't someone summarize it for you?
- Yes.

98
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,231
I'm going to bed now.
- Goodnight, honey.

99
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,228
Goodnight, Birgitte.

100
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,752
Sleep well.

101
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,389
The F26 Defender is the next
generation from Triton Technologies.

102
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,235
It is built to deliver both
air-to-air and air-to-ground -

103
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,552
- thanks to its state-of-the-art bomb
and missile systems.

104
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,078
The stealth technology allows it
to strike without being noticed.

105
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,438
You won't know what hit you
before it's too late.

106
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,194
Thank you.

107
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,909
Hans Christian, will you go first?
- Gladly.

108
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,191
The future image of the enemy
indicates that we need aircraft -

109
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,035
that can't be picked up
on our present radar.

110
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,990
The F26 Defender is the only fighter
that meets this demand.

111
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,598
The literature says that the Defender
is the only one not in the air.

112
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,196
So there's a risk
of technical teething troubles.

113
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,353
The Triton factory
guarantees that won't happen.

114
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,557
Factories always say that.

115
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,193
Several analyses indicate
that soon radar systems -

116
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,195
will be able to trace
the Defender's stealth technology.

117
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,708
Who knows what the future will bring?
So let's concentrate on the present.

118
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,431
Bent, we approved new planes.
- You know more than I do.

119
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,388
But we need to justify
spending DKK 130bn.

120
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,997
Defense Command Denmark
has worked on this for years.

121
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,429
With all due respect, you have
purchased many things by mistake.

122
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,229
APCs that tipped over,
faulty helicopters -

123
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,868
and drones that never took flight.

124
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,829
We'll put it on the back burner
and check it out.

125
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,558
Gentlemen...

126
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,999
Bent?

127
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,756
Yes?

128
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,672
Do we have a meeting?
- No.

129
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,992
And I'm not here
as your Minister for Finance.

130
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,391
I'm here as your friend.
Do you have a minute?

131
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,154
Birgitte,
you need to see the big picture.

132
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,155
Be careful you don't get lost
in all the details.

133
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,110
DKK 130bn isn't a detail.
- Yes, in the big picture.

134
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,398
Thorsen is your Defense Minister.
- That's not reassuring.

135
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,509
He's in the military's pocket.
Take the CIA flights over Greenland.

136
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,151
If you take responsibility for
everything, it all falls back on you.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,517
No PM can take that in the long run.

138
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,038
The Romans called it 'divide and rule'.
Let your ministers do their work.

139
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,749
If they screw up,
you can fire them.

140
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,710
In my experience, there's often
something to be said about it.

141
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,351
What if something happens
in the Ministry of Health?

142
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,593
Will you decide who is to run
the University Hospital?

143
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,231
Let the Ministry of Defense
buy those damn fighters.

144
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,757
Let's move on. Negotiations
have been ongoing for 7-8 years.

145
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,550
You happen to be the PM now
when the order was to be given.

146
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,553
Yes, and that will reflect on me.

147
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,235
Christ!
You have to trust the experts.

148
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,836
But I can't, Bent.

149
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,798
Then tell me something.

150
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:39,080
Who will be prime minister
while you do all ourjobs?

151
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,830
I thought you had quit. Again.
- Yes, so did I.

152
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,913
The press release arrived.
They chose the Defender.

153
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,595
The minister will be here
on the news at 6 p. m.

154
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,230
So we'll do what we agreed on.
- Of course.

155
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,713
I requested disclosure from Defense
Command about the selection process.

156
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,149
Christ! At least ten employees
dream of having yourjob.

157
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,393
They want to be on camera,
but they don't have what it takes.

158
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,838
Let them do theirjob.
Have faith that they can do it well.

159
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,075
I'd like a car home now.

160
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,028
Yes, I signed my contract yesterday,
but I won't start till next month -

161
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,192
so I have time to read everything.

162
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,389
Yes, but listen.
I have to go now.

163
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,518
Okay. Fine then.
Thank you.

164
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,558
Bye.
- This sucks, Phillip.

165
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,831
Your firm delivered for EUR 5 billion
won'th of hardware for the Defender.

166
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,393
So what? We're subcontractors
to another subcontractor.

167
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,714
Your hardware will be in the fighters
that my administration is buying.

168
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,910
You'll make money on my decision.
- Birgitte, you're seeing ghosts.

169
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,868
Via Electronics
isn't a partner of Triton.

170
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,793
We're just subcontractors.

171
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:55,238
We'll make peanuts
in comparison to the size of the order.

172
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,393
It's really not a problem.
Believe me.

173
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,669
Okay.

174
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,275
I'll just run it by Kasper.

175
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,553
It corresponds to you
buying gas for your state car -

176
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,838
- and Phillip happens to be
the CEO of the gas company.

177
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,755
So the press won't give us hell?
- No, your government is exemplary.

178
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,072
There's nothing wrong with it.
I promise you.

179
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,835
Thank you, Kasper.
You might have saved my marriage.

180
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,118
Don't forget to see Thorsen.
- I won't. Bye.

181
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,432
Most of our NATO allies
have bought the Defender.

182
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,958
That's an advantage
in all our international operations.

183
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,518
Danish industry will benefit
from the counter-purchases -

184
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,514
by the Triton factories.
Was that an incentive?

185
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,673
No, but is it a bad thing
that industry makes money?

186
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,994
Is it the best fighter for our pilots
or the best for Danish industry?

187
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,870
It's the best fighter.
I'd like to reiterate that...

188
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,952
Katrine, wrap it up after his answer.

189
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,875
It's a question of national security.
- Thank you for coming.

190
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,795
The purchase of new fighters
is part of the new Defense Agreement.

191
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,839
Now you've learned a bit
about fighters, little girl.

192
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,678
Back to the studio.
That's a wrap, Katrine.

193
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,755
The minister is hiding something.
- What could it be?

194
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,472
Something's not right.
- Or didn't you like 'little girl'?

195
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,875
Thorsen is army and a chauvinist.
That's refreshing.

196
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:03,434
Why is an army guy interested in what
industry gets out of buying fighters?

197
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,789
I see where you're going,
but believe me, there's nothing there.

198
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,636
Morning. Is this true?
- We're checking it out.

199
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,634
Get the Minister of Defense
in my office in an hour.

200
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,952
Friis,
Hanne Holm has documented -

201
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,513
that the Defense Minister went
on six hunting trips paid by Triton.

202
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,240
Holm is a watchdog for corruption.

203
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,474
Isn't that a good thing?
- Yes. It's a damn good thing.

204
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,839
Danes aren't interested in hearing
about ministers' expensive habits.

205
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,836
Grouse hunting is very exclusive.
It costs 25,000 per person per day.

206
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,551
Plus room and board.
- Let's get Thorsen in the studio.

207
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,271
Let Research find other participants.
- Yes, Dad.

208
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,195
Here are the files
from Defense Command.

209
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,511
Thanks.
That was pretty damn quick.

210
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,639
What's that?
- I told you I requested disclosure.

211
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,555
Katrine, you're a well-paid anchor.
You're not here to do research.

212
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,190
I know,
but I already requested them.

213
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,195
Is 'the little girl' still bothered
about Thorsen's comment?

214
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,477
Do I look like a sensitive person?

215
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,996
Defense Command, Lars Bang.
- Katrine Fønsmark, TV1 News.

216
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,357
Some documents are missing
from the files.

217
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,355
I'm sorry, but our archives have been
moved and aren't quite in order.

218
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,911
When will they be available?
- I don't know.

219
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,868
But you're welcome to visit
with any specific questions.

220
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,592
Great. When?
- How about right now?

221
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,389
I'm a big fan of your work.
You're very good.

222
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,236
Thank you.
When will the archives be in order?

223
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,837
I don't know, but perhaps
we can answer your questions.

224
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,199
We'd very much like to help.
It's this way.

225
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:43,396
Here are the tenders. The Chief of
Defense has taken time off to be here.

226
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,430
Thank you, Lars. The Defender has
key qualities, which led to our choice.

227
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,752
I'm not asking about
technical details.

228
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,356
But they determined
our choice.

229
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,637
I'm interested in the decision process.

230
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,079
Is it true that you attended meetings
in Scotland with the minister?

231
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,912
Correct.

232
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,550
It was part of my job
as Minister of Defense.

233
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,030
The meetings in Scotland
were of a technical nature.

234
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,670
Including eight-course dinners
and hunting trips.

235
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,833
Traveling is a necessary evil
in my job.

236
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,677
What's wrong with investigating
the fighters before we invest 120bn?

237
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,195
130bn.

238
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,275
Has the press seen these?
The agendas from the trip?

239
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,513
Can you give me details
of the meetings and trips?

240
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,629
Among other things, we were
informed about the weapons systems.

241
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,316
Is it true that expensive
hunting trips were included?

242
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,712
I must admit that I wasn't very
interested in the expense account.

243
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,668
How much hunting was there
compared to work?

244
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,116
A total of four hours of meetings
in three days.

245
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,511
The rest was hunting and meals.

246
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,674
Fried foie gras accompanied by
a 1998 Romanée-Conti. Christ!

247
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,991
I didn't organize the trips.
- No.

248
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,871
Despite your dislike of traveling,
the fine dining must have suited you.

249
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,795
I'm told that hunting trips like that
can cost 25,000 per person.

250
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,839
Did you have any qualms
over accepting that trip?

251
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,673
Good gracious, my dear.

252
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,277
Triton is a huge enterprise.
The amount was insignificant.

253
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,913
And I can assure you that nothing
covert happened at Glen Farlan.

254
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,114
Glen Farlan?

255
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,795
One of the estates where we met.
- May I see the agendas?

256
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,757
No.

257
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,153
If journalists want to see the agenda,
I can spill coffee on the right places.

258
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,312
What is your name?
- Henrik Mikkelsen.

259
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,157
Listen, Henrik Mikkelsen.
Don't ever take that tone with me -

260
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,757
if you want to keep yourjob.
Is that clear?

261
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,038
Hans Christian,
is there anything else I should know?

262
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,350
No.

263
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,235
Good.

264
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,716
Thank you.

265
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,471
Sorry we couldn't be more helpful.
- You were a great help.

266
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,717
Glen Farlan.
John McCoy speaking.

267
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,749
My name is Katrine Fønsmark.
I'm a Danish journalist at TV1.

268
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:11,029
I'm calling to ask about a guest.
- Sorry, we don't talk to journalists.

269
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,915
Hello? Jeff Carlyle.
- Katrine Fønsmark from Danish TV1.

270
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,834
John McCoy just gave me
your number.

271
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,434
How can I help you?

272
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,990
Are you the hunting guide
at Glen Farlan?

273
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,756
No! Some other time.
Jesus Christ!

274
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,232
I talked to an employee
at the estate in Scotland.

275
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,517
He told me something
very interesting.

276
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,756
Thorsen received two hunting rifles
won'th DKK 250,000 from Triton.

277
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,751
Jesus.
Can we document it?

278
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,873
What should I do?
- You're asking me?

279
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,918
Jesus! This is new.
It suits you.

280
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,673
Tell the ministry you're changing
the premise of the interview.

281
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:29,233
It will also be about the gifts
the Defense Minister received.

282
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,076
If they complain,
tell them we know about the guns.

283
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,198
But he can still cover his ass.

284
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,957
Otherwise he might refuse to answer,
and the interview will be useless.

285
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,318
Be glad I'm not chewing you out
for investigative journalism.

286
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,519
Is that because I made a scoop?

287
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,672
This conversation is over. Go!

288
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:01,878
We're doing our best to find
the best solution for the Air Force.

289
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,192
This is a matter
of national security.

290
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,673
So your decision wasn't influenced
by Triton's expensive hunting trips?

291
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,197
No, not at all.
- Did you also receive a gift?

292
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,511
That's true.
When a minister travels...

293
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,357
Let's hear a comment from
Jeff Carlisle from the estate.

294
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,957
The Danish minister received a pair
of guns with his name engraved.

295
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,750
- What kind of guns?
- A pair of Purdey shotguns.

296
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,517
- Do you know the price of them?
- About 25,000 pounds.

297
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,875
An expensive gift.

298
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,717
A minister receives official gifts,
but they belong to the ministry.

299
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,634
But when your name is engraved,
they must be personal.

300
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,590
Yes. When I realized the mistake,
I returned them.

301
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,548
When did you realize that?
- I don't recall.

302
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,555
You don't recall when you saw
your name on guns won'th 250,000?

303
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,756
No.

304
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:17,755
I believe I answered that question.
- Katrine, wrap it up.

305
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,879
Today? Yesterday? A week ago?
- I couldn't say.

306
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,352
End it, Katrine.
- Thank you for coming.

307
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,988
Super, Katrine.

308
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,596
The little girl learned
a bit about shotguns today.

309
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,916
Hans Christian, for fuck's sake!
You said you told me everything.

310
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,154
But on the news I hear
you received an expensive shotgun.

311
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,311
An oversight.

312
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,838
As long as Hans Christian
wasn't caught telling a blatant lie...

313
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,710
When did you return the guns?
- Earlier today.

314
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,873
Okay. It's vital that Thorsen
is brief and precise with the press.

315
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,874
It's a regrettable misunderstanding.
That's all.

316
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,953
We'll lay down a strategy
for the other ministries.

317
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,671
This is extremely problematic.
It taints the government.

318
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,628
I hope you can see that.
- I assure you, this is the end of it.

319
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,351
What good is that?
You've said that before. Thank you.

320
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,798
I'll let myself out.
- You'll be hearing from me.

321
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,910
What did I tell you?
- Forget Thorsen.

322
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,470
If you fire him,
you'll be in the spotlight.

323
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,758
We chose the fighter,
and the Opposition is content.

324
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,799
What do you suggest?
- Let him be. He closed the case.

325
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,116
There's something else
we have to discuss.

326
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,752
It's a more serious matter.
Phillip's new job.

327
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,471
You said it wasn't a problem.
- That was before this Thorsen thing.

328
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:11,028
The press are out to get us. The good
girl's government has dirty hands.

329
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,273
My colleagues
in other ministries say -

330
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,477
that the press smells blood.

331
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,873
Even a subcontractor to
a subcontractor would be enough.

332
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,352
There must be a countermove.
- Not the way I see it.

333
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,877
So far you've been squeaky clean.
It would be a scoop -

334
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,838
if they find something on you.

335
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,278
Nothing is trivial anymore.
They're going for thejugular.

336
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,911
It's a mechanism
that has nothing to do with reality.

337
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,238
What exactly are you saying?

338
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,837
I don't see how Phillip
can keep thatjob.

339
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,948
Hi.

340
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,999
You're home late.
- Phillip, we have to talk.

341
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,754
What?

342
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,189
We can't control this any longer.

343
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,316
Can't control what?

344
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,395
The Defense Minister's gifts
have made the press smell blood.

345
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,518
And?
- They'll dig up everything.

346
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,319
Everything.

347
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,879
Birgitte, I don't get it.

348
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,394
I'm terribly sorry,
but you can't take that job.

349
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,039
But I already took it.
What are you talking about?

350
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,079
They'll use it against me.

351
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,791
Even the smallest mistake
can bring down the government.

352
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,270
The deal was made
long before I took the job.

353
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,830
But the press
doesn't see it that way.

354
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,231
Your company will make money
on a decision I made.

355
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,791
I already took thejob!
It's been in the financial papers!

356
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,112
Do you realize how embarrassing
it would be to resign?

357
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,159
I understand how you feel
and your frustration.

358
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,039
Don't talk to me like
some HR person.

359
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,716
You're firing me because
you can't fire your Defense Minister.

360
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,997
The future of the government
is at stake.

361
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:06,756
We can't afford
that they find any fault with me.

362
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,831
No.

363
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,194
My husband can't take thatjob.
- Can you have a husband at all?

364
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,629
Kasper wrote a draft of a press release
that Via Electronics should send out.

365
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,079
Very nice indeed.
It's my idea to quit -

366
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,199
because I don't want to undermine
the PM's credibility.

367
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,397
What a great husband you have.

368
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,795
I have to know if...
- I'll quit.

369
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,875
But don't fucking count on me
lifting another finger for you.

370
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,594
Where are you going?

371
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,273
Will the PM fire Thorsen?
- No way.

372
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,672
Not in the middle
of a Defense Agreement.

373
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,196
All the other stations want
the clip of Thorsen.

374
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,478
Well done on the interview.
Have you talked to Research?

375
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,078
We're going through all
the government's meetings, trips, etc.

376
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,711
Excellent. Can we get the PM
to come in for an interview?

377
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,158
I've tried to contact her, but
we can only get the Defense Minister.

378
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,439
We could have Katrine call
her good friend Kasper Juul.

379
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,195
You said you like being
a investigative reporter.

380
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,875
Yes.
- Good. That's a deal.

381
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,228
The only solution is to keep
our mouths shut till this blows over.

382
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,554
No comment to the press.
It's like infidelity:

383
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,234
Deny, deny, deny.

384
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,597
What if we're like an open book?

385
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,278
We make diaries available.
Lists of gifts. Travel agendas.

386
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,991
Put everything on the net.
- It's a dangerous road.

387
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,630
Because the ministers will see it
as control on your part -

388
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,997
with the Danish people
as witnesses.

389
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,234
It's the people who voted for them.
- It'll be unpopular in the cabinet.

390
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,710
Can you put up with openness?
- Yes.

391
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,159
Phillip is resigning.
It's being released today.

392
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,834
How did he take it?

393
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,595
The after-school center called.

394
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,754
Your son hasn't been picked up.
And we can't contact your husband.

395
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,198
He must be running late.

396
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,033
This one is 388%.
I've done the first three.

397
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,112
Can you do the rest?
- Yes.

398
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,714
Where is Dad?

399
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,032
He's very busy these days.

400
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,749
The Defense Minister
has apologized.

401
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,753
It'sjust a misunderstanding -

402
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,277
- that shouldn't prevent the military
from getting their fighter.

403
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,399
The New Conservatives
can claim a lot of credit for that.

404
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,030
Hi, Kasper.
- The New Conservatives like us.

405
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,593
Yvonne agreed to vote for the budget
if she got 600m for the armed forces.

406
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,073
You can go on the news tomorrow
and present your plan for openness.

407
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:15,199
I'm helping Laura with her homework.
See you tomorrow.

408
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:19,797
How do find the average?
- Let me see your equation.

409
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,758
Okay. That's far too much.

410
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,109
Hi, Dad. Fine.
We're doing homework.

411
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,636
Or Mom is doing my homework.

412
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,349
Ask him where he is.
- Yes, pizza and coke.

413
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,193
He's out playing.

414
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,797
I'm here to see Kasper Juul.
- Go on in.

415
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,795
Hi.

416
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,519
See you.
- Bye.

417
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:03,754
My boss thinks I should make
professional use of our relationship.

418
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,072
Then let's keep it that way.
Coffee?

419
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,353
Just water, please.

420
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,719
You can have an interview
with the PM after all.

421
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,398
Birgitte Nyborg wants to be
totally open from now on.

422
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,395
So all diaries, travel agendas
and meetings will be on the net.

423
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,348
Thorsen has made life difficult
for Birgitte Nyborg.

424
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,318
She must be under a lot of pressure.

425
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,950
Did you watch the news today?
- I reported it.

426
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,274
Yvonne Kjær clearly stated that
the government isn't under pressure.

427
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,512
The cabinet will be transparent.

428
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,559
And Nyborg will say that
in the interview. What about Thorsen?

429
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,349
She has nothing to add
to the Defense Minister's comments.

430
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,115
I thought there'd be a catch.
- You get your interview.

431
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,638
And we have an opportunity to explain
our openness to you exclusively.

432
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,758
And the only catch is:

433
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:15,630
We could give the interview
to some otherjournalist.

434
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,110
Hi, Bent.
- Hi, Laura.

435
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,432
Thank you for coming.
I can't leave the children alone.

436
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,070
Would you like some coffee?
- Please.

437
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,758
Tomorrow I'm presenting
my suggestion about openness.

438
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,878
I've sent e-mails.
- Indeed.

439
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,716
The cabinet will be furious,
including me.

440
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,192
What's going on, Birgitte?

441
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,592
Reporters are lining up
to find dirt on us.

442
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,072
No, what's up with you
and your family? Where's Phillip?

443
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:08,028
Listen. Will you help me
convince the cabinet?

444
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,351
Where is Phillip?
- He won't answer his phone.

445
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,071
I even called our friends.
No one knows where he is.

446
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,436
Don't do that.
I'll just start crying.

447
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,554
I had to ask him
to resign his position.

448
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,469
He looked forward to that job.
- It's a terrible contradiction.

449
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,031
In Parliament we fight for the modern
family where both parents work.

450
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,389
But for an MP's marriage to work,
the spouse has to stay at home.

451
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,310
Is he having an affair?
- No.

452
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,915
Laura, I have to go to Parliament.
I'll be back soon.

453
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,834
Will you watch Magnus?
- Yes.

454
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,312
Call me if you need me.
- Okay. Goodnight.

455
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,630
Hi, Freja.
May I come in for a minute?

456
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,950
Thank you.

457
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,588
What's going on?

458
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,474
I'm sorry. I thought...

459
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,431
I'm terribly sorry.

460
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,071
Mom, it's late.
We have to get up now.

461
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,834
Mom?
- Coming.

462
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,358
I don't have any clean underwear.
Where are Magnus' trunks?

463
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,389
Why does he need them?
- He goes swimming on Fridays.

464
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,553
We're out of milk.
- Okay.

465
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,837
When is Dad coming home?

466
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,356
Good morning, Kasper.
- Are you on your way?

467
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:02,550
No, we're having breakfast.
- You're on the news at 8:30 p. m.

468
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,157
I'll be there in half an hour.
We can talk then. Bye.

469
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,148
Magnus! Time to get up.

470
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,949
The interview with the PM
is our top story.

471
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,159
Did you see that Phillip Christensen
resigned from Via Electronics?

472
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:23,677
Yes, but I promised the PM
that we'd only talk about openness.

473
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:29,836
And you know that Via Electronics has
delivered hardware for the Defender.

474
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,472
Nyborg's transparency in government
is affecting her own husband.

475
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:40,714
So what's the story?
- The great personal sacrifice.

476
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,111
Ask for permission
before asking private questions.

477
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,909
And we need to know before 1 p. m.
- I'll call them now.

478
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,356
I won't talk about my private life.

479
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,593
It's not a bad idea
to give it a personal angle.

480
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,275
Did you hear what I said?
- Yes.

481
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,512
Is everything okay?

482
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:09,791
I talked to Kasper Juul
about the interview.

483
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,398
No questions of a private nature.
- Why did you talk to Kasper?

484
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,157
Because it's important to the PM
that we stick to our agreement.

485
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,835
So he talked to the little girl's boss.

486
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,834
It shows that we're on to something.
- Yes, but a deal's a deal.

487
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,959
No mention of private matters.
- But it isn't private.

488
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,511
The government's demand
for openness is a big diversion -

489
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,355
that prevents Nyborg's
husband from keeping his job.

490
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,995
The Defense Minister's mess has
consequences for the PM's husband.

491
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,029
That's a clever analysis,
but where do you want to take it?

492
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,638
I want to get the story back on track.
Our Minister of Defense is corrupt.

493
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,713
Forget it.
- All this openness is a diversion.

494
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,749
Should her husband pay the price?
- Do not mention her private life.

495
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,233
This story isn't won'th
making an enemy of the PM's Office.

496
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,109
If he hadn't quit,
you could have fired away.

497
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,478
But that isn't the case.
- I strongly disagree.

498
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,074
And you're welcome to.

499
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,869
Here's confirmation
from the PM's Office.

500
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,034
If you're still in doubt, shout it
from the rooftops. We're used to it.

501
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,435
Fine, Kasper.
See you later.

502
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,479
Take your shoes off.
- You're not my mother.

503
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,394
Just take them off.
- Be nice, you two.

504
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,189
I'm on the news tonight,
so Trine will make dinner.

505
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,079
Hi, kids.

506
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,755
Hi. Did you miss me?
- What do you think?

507
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,434
Hello, gorgeous.

508
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,273
Hi.

509
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,433
Go up to Laura's room
while I talk to Mom.

510
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,592
I won't be long.

511
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,555
Where have you been?
Why didn't you call me back?

512
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,790
I talked to Freja.

513
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,116
You're damn lucky
she didn't go to the press.

514
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,430
I know.

515
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,710
But I was frightened, Phillip.

516
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,192
You can't disappear for days.
It scares me.

517
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,115
It made me think
you were with someone else.

518
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,197
I was.

519
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,114
I was so fucking angry with you
and your damn job.

520
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,078
So I...

521
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:13,791
I felt like breaking something
and...

522
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,560
Birgitte...

523
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:35,349
Christ, Birgitte.
Are you okay?

524
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,876
Mom, what happened?
- I tripped over my bag.

525
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,794
My God, I'm clumsy.
I need to clean up.

526
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,318
Did I frighten you, sweetie?
- How about some tea?

527
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,197
Are we ready for the news?

528
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,794
Wait. Stop.

529
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,478
Do we cancel?
- No, we can't.

530
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,598
What the hell happened?

531
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,438
Make something up.

532
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,115
Torben, this is Kasper Juul.
The PM took a fall.

533
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,559
We need your best make-up artist
if we're going to do this interview.

534
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,629
Good. Bye.

535
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:58,152
Are you okay?
- No.

536
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,518
Can you do it?
- I'll be fine.

537
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,592
Let's go.

538
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,678
Welcome to TV1 News. Tonight's
guest is our Prime Minister.

539
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,991
Can you conceal it?
- Not completely.

540
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,630
But you'll look fine.

541
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,075
Can you make sure that the PM
is only shot from the right?

542
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,950
I'll talk to the cameramen.
- And no one else comes in here.

543
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,716
Is that clear, 1 and 3?
- Only from her right side.

544
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,154
Katrine, stand on the other side.

545
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,754
Okay. Hi.

546
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,595
Welcome.
And thank you for coming.

547
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,673
Four seconds.
- 3, 2, 1...

548
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,237
My guest today is
Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg.

549
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,073
Pan out. Not too close.

550
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:22,997
You're showing your hand. Diaries
and gift lists are going on the net.

551
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,516
Why do you find it necessary
to be open?

552
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,672
We have a responsibility
to the voters.

553
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,434
They mustn't lose confidence in us.

554
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,355
The initiative for more openness
isn't a new idea.

555
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,629
The Defense Minister's travels made
it necessary to speed the process up.

556
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,998
Will there be any repercussions
for the Defense Minister?

557
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,312
I consider it a slip-up
that he has apologized for.

558
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,794
He has the support of Parliament.
I see no reason to pursue it further.

559
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,875
Will the rest of the cabinet
have to pay for his slip-up -

560
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,715
since they'll be
constantly monitored?

561
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,475
No one is being punished here.

562
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,428
The public needs to know
what the politicians are doing.

563
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,275
That's only fair. This administration
has nothing to hide.

564
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,512
Katrine, wrap it up.

565
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,595
Yesterday there was a press release -

566
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,276
stating that Phillip Christensen
has resigned as CEO of a company.

567
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,477
Is that correct?
- Yes.

568
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:45,112
Katrine, stop!
- Sorry. Technical difficulties.

569
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,068
What the hell?
- She took off her earpiece.

570
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,279
Would your husband have resigned
had you not been forced -

571
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,910
to speed up
the process of openness?

572
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,279
Has your husband not paid
a high price for Thorsen's slip-up?

573
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:09,115
The consequences of
my administration's decisions -

574
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,831
do affect my own life,
just like any other Dane's life.

575
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,594
And that's the way it should be.

576
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:21,914
My husband and I aren't above
other citizens in this country.

577
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,868
My husband made the decision
to resign himself -

578
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,273
when the Defender
was decided on.

579
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,998
I'm very grateful
that I can count on him.

580
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,355
Damn, she's good.

581
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,356
Also when it comes down to giving
up something you're pleased about.

582
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,080
I'm very grateful.

583
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,313
Would he have made that decision
without this new openness?

584
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,510
Yes. It's a matter of my husband
not profiting by my politics...

585
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,790
At least as long
as he's married to me.

586
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,074
Thank you.

587
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,350
Now for the weather forecast.

588
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,909
Who the hell do you think you are?
- What do you mean?

589
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,995
You took off your earpiece.
- There was an echo.

590
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,596
Shut the fuck up.
An echo?

591
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,957
Was it a good interview?

592
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:41,398
It isn't about that.
You didn't stick to our agreement.

593
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,509
The PM's office will formally complain
to the director tomorrow.

594
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,753
I'm sick of being told off by you.
I've had enough!

595
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,639
Now you listen to me!

596
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,952
You have four weeks of vacation.
Clear your desk and go on vacation.

597
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,193
Think about whether
you're part of this team or not.

598
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,150
I'm very sorry
that question was asked.

599
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,599
But know this.
You were absolutely fantastic.

600
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,071
That really hit home.
- Great, Kasper.

601
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,391
See you tomorrow.

602
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,758
I'd like to go home now.

603
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,958
Hi.

604
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,790
I talked to the kids.
They're asleep.

605
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,758
Could you see my eye on TV?

606
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,673
No, not at all.

607
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,037
I'm so sorry about what happened.

608
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:27,354
I'm coming home.
We can talk and find a solution.

609
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,832
With you as head of negotiations?
- Stop it, Phillip.

610
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,632
The kids are counting on one of us
being here in the morning.

611
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,793
So if you want to come home -

612
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,396
I'll spend the night
at a friend's house.

613
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,869
What?

614
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:55,272
Why won't you talk to me?

615
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:02,471
Because...
We don't talk, Birgitte.

616
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,590
That was something
we used to do.

617
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,399
I'll spend the night here.

618
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,873
There's been a change of plans.
I'm not going home after all.

619
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,999
Do you want to go back
to the office?

620
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,153
No.
Take me to Marienborg.

621
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,918
