1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,434
Darling,
you've bought for 12,000 dollars.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,275
I only had my official Eurocard.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,908
I'll settle it with the PM's Office.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,076
Kasper, my usually smart ex -

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,518
asked me today
if I was seeing anyone. Ole!

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,150
Come on, damn it!
It's not funny, okay?

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,630
I think he's dead.
- Where are you?

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,756
I know something that could make
the right person prime minister.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,072
This is a receipt proving -

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,756
that you billed the state $12,000
for gifts to your wife, Prime Minister.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,357
Come in at 9 tomorrow
and clear your desk.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,398
You look like a statesman tonight.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,076
Birgitte! Birgitte!
- They want me for prime minister.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,514
"It is much more secure to be feared,
than to be loved. " - Machiavelli

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,356
The Solidarity Party,
The Green Party, Labour and us -

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,476
together we have 91 seats.

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,871
You have the seats you need.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,874
Think anyone's got cold feet?
- You have enough seats.

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,715
What about Labour?
- Laugesen just got KO'ed.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,348
Nervous?

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,278
Her Majesty is waiting to give you
the mandate to form the cabinet.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,709
The people gave me the mandate.
- Posing as a republican, are we?

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,070
You're loving this.

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,550
Cabinet-forming negotiations
with the Queen is a nice tradition.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,713
The election winner
meets with the Queen.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,396
It's the least we can do after
they put the people in power in 1849.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,718
Why is she keeping us waiting?

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,031
Maybe she went out
to get cigarettes.

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,751
More coffee while you wait?
- No, thank you.

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,276
Her Majesty will see you in a moment.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,109
Something's wrong.
They're trying to win time.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,556
God damn it! Everyone wants you
to chair the negotiations.

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,669
Don't swear at the Palace.
- This isn't the hard part.

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,675
The hard part is controlling
the process the next couple of days -

35
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,356
so that you end up presenting
your new cabinet. Remember that.

36
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,670
Yes.

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,353
Look, we've got 91 seats.
Can't the bitch count?

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,877
Her Majesty will see you now.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,035
GOVERNMENT
Episode 2- Count to 90

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,712
How was the Queen?
- Polite in a royal way.

41
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,192
Did they live like on TV?
- Yes.

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,557
Did you curtsey?
- You have to.

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,713
Good morning.

44
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,919
Hey, the Prime Minister
is eating her cereal in our kitchen.

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,997
Good morning, Bent.
- I've lined up today's meetings.

46
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,438
Solidarity, the Greens,
the Liberals and the Freedom Party.

47
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,674
What about Labour?
- I'm banking on them coming first.

48
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,071
Mom, you're on TV.
- Hang on.

49
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
Bent, we're on TV.

50
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,790
Is Denmark going to get
its first female prime minister?

51
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,479
Yesterday, Birgitte Nyborg was
appointed royal investigator.

52
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,919
Torben Friis, welcome.
What kind of game are we witnessing?

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,470
It's the game
for political power in Danmark.

54
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,791
It proved a dramatic 24 hours
for Hesselboe.

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,394
Indeed, and as a result thereof -

56
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,677
- he had the cabinet step down
yesterday.

57
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,358
He had a bad election,
and I'm betting this nasty affair...

58
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,718
It's been seven good years, Lars.
- Thank you.

59
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,077
Laugesen is partly to blame.

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,117
Labour -

61
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,431
- suffered their worst election ever.

62
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,593
Laugesen's very aggressive attack...

63
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,074
When can you see the radio news?
- Bjorn, get the hell out. Get lost!

64
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,391
Laugesen is fighting
for his political life.

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,635
His party takes exception to him
and his campaign methods.

66
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,588
Let's look at the distribution of seats
in the new parliament.

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,470
- 91 and 88.
- A clear majority.

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,515
Birgitte!

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,630
So, the Prime Minister bikes?
- You'd better ask the Prime Minister.

70
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,554
When will you form the cabinet?
- No comment.

71
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,673
Good morning.
- Birgitte.

72
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,718
Congratulations. It's fantastic.

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,510
We've got a historic chance
to get Denmark back on track.

74
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,195
I'm meeting with Labour first, Amir.

75
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,875
It's a great day for democracy,
Birgitte.

76
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,193
Good morning. Let's switch to fruit
during meetings. I gave this up.

77
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,196
Labour won't come until this
afternoon. They're being tactical.

78
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,717
Or falling apart.
Let's reschedule another party then.

79
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,795
The Freedom Party's got time now
and then Solidarity, we hope.

80
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,953
Tell Laugesen it's crucial
that he shows up today. Anytime.

81
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,274
Tell Laugesen we're forming
a cabinet without Labour.

82
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,228
Look, we need to close this today.
- No chance.

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,191
Everyone gets a fair treatment. I've
made a list of items for each party.

84
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,516
Aicha Nagrawi.
- Good morning.

85
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,835
We can meet at 11.
We have a list of items -

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,279
crucial to a potential collaboration.

87
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,035
Congratulations on being elected.

88
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,958
The lady got a new head scarf, I see.
Hello there.

89
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,795
My mom wore a head scarf, too.
She was from a fishing town.

90
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Hello, Bent. Congratulations
on your fantastic election.

91
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,756
And congratulations to you.
You did well, too. Sit down.

92
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,270
Thank you for coming. We've got
quite a political bridge to gap.

93
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,797
Still, I'd like to find out
where we see eye to eye.

94
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,079
Landslide-shocked are we, Birgitte?

95
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,552
Let's begin with tax policy.

96
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,714
Look, I followed Glistrup
back in 1971-

97
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,919
when the Conservatives
refused to let him run.

98
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,152
After that, Glistrup formed
the Progress Party.

99
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,313
One and a half years later
he gained 28 seats in Parliament.

100
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,268
He didn't hesitate for a second.
He was a winner.

101
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,468
Your party just doubled its vote.
Why don't you sound like a winner?

102
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,473
Glistrup went to jail...
- Look.

103
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,113
You and I differ on immigration,
economy, taxes -

104
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,999
culture, environment.

105
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,948
Everything you stand for
I'm against.

106
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,989
I am evil incarnate
in your little intellectual world.

107
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,869
You don't have time
to drink coffee with me.

108
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,873
But let me give you a piece of advice.

109
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,750
Take the head of the table
when you chair the negotiations.

110
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,596
Don't mind if I make it
a pastry to go, do you?

111
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,752
Have a nice day now.

112
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,515
Lots of people would like to fuck
the prime minister if it were Nyborg.

113
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,869
I've never heard that said before.
- She's a babe.

114
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,875
Did Hanne Holm congratulate you
on hosting the final debate?

115
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,389
Give me a smoke, Dan.
- I thought you quit.

116
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,272
We've got a hectic schedule, but we
need to cover the Ole Dahl funeral -

117
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,595
which is today.
It's going to draw a huge crowd.

118
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,788
Simon, bring a crew
and get some comments.

119
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,236
Pia, you got a scoop.

120
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,712
Lars Hesselboe and his wife are
guests on 'Focus' this Sunday -

121
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,716
to talk about the death of Ole Dahl,
marriage and the big downfall.

122
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,035
I'm thinking Katrine.
You're fucking good at emotions.

123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,115
I don't have time to prepare for it.
- Say what?

124
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,193
I'm planning on attending the funeral.

125
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,514
Oh, you knew him?
- Through my talks with Hesselboe.

126
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,719
During the election
I talked to him lots of...

127
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,396
I'll take it. Let her anchor at six.
- Sure, if it's okay with Katrine.

128
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,678
Are you with us on this? The swap?
- Sure.

129
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,635
Have we got
any background info on Nyborg?

130
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,113
We're talking to her old classmates.
- Perfect, pile it on. See you later.

131
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,759
I just went upstairs
to sound out the Moderates.

132
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,277
Nyborg hasn't got a clue.
It's a waste of time.

133
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,837
Are you sure?
- Hi, Lars. See you later.

134
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,872
What ministries do you want?
- Environment and five or six more.

135
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,316
Maybe a new Ministry of Climate.

136
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,392
You're entitled
to four ministries, max.

137
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,270
Don't you want to be PM?
- Yes, but I won't be blackmailed.

138
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,113
Think it over and let me know.

139
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,068
An Inger Hansen is here.

140
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,598
Hi. I'm afraid Lars Hesselboe
couldn't meet with you personally.

141
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,389
I saw him in the hall half an hour ago.

142
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,949
Who are you?
- Inger Hansen.

143
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,079
I'm a member of the Liberals.
- Can you speak for the party?

144
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,758
Yes, during the initial meetings.
- There are no initial meetings.

145
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,593
We're forming a cabinet here.

146
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,197
If Hesselboe can't find the time,
we'll go on without the Liberals.

147
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,155
You just need Labour
to close the deal.

148
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,074
Laugesen will be right in.
- Don't bet on it.

149
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,516
He's leaving Parliament now.

150
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,470
Laugesen is leaving now. Have you
given Birgitte Nyborg your support?

151
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,676
I haven't met with her.

152
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,638
I have a meeting with my constituents.

153
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,633
- Are you still party leader?
- No comment.

154
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,793
Arrogant son of a bitch.
We agreed to meet half an hour ago.

155
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,397
Michael, call me.

156
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,510
We're watching you leave on TV,
and we have a meeting in ten minutes.

157
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,628
I expect you to call me back
and reschedule ASAP. Thanks.

158
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,473
What the hell is going on, Bent?

159
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,632
I'm stuck without Labour.

160
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,316
I can't form a fucking cabinet
with Solidarity and the Greens!

161
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,233
I'm losing control.

162
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,358
I'm losing control.
It's slipping away.

163
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,832
Take it easy
and go home to your family.

164
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,439
You lost the battle today.
You're going to win tomorrow.

165
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,190
Did everyone get that?

166
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,230
No. What does G stand for?
- At least pretend you've read this.

167
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,349
G stands for 'government'.
State funds or credits.

168
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,240
Page 27 in International Finance.
This is basic knowledge, people.

169
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,758
That's all for today.
- Please tell us about Friedman.

170
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,438
Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize winner,
Reagan's economic advisor.

171
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,558
Next time, people.
- How about...

172
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,633
Amina, go get a coffee
and find yourself a boyfriend.

173
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,270
Hi, kids. Hi, sweetie.

174
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,637
I thought you had to work late.
- We're stuck.

175
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,590
I need to make more random visits.
Good-looking students.

176
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,115
Stupid girl.

177
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,589
I know Laugesen is just
flexing his muscles -

178
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,718
but without Labour I'm dead.

179
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,159
I'm the smaller party. Why should they
agree to make me Prime Minister?

180
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,709
Because they took a beating.

181
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,873
Sure, they're the largest party,
but they've never been smaller.

182
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,669
If you want the job, just take it.

183
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,675
You've got to bluff.
Everyone does in the corporate world.

184
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,230
This isn't about qualifications.

185
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,558
Men lie themselves 50% better
atjob interviews.

186
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,795
Women make themselves 50% worse
by talking about what they can't.

187
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,431
Why do you think there aren't
any more women poker players?

188
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,038
They can't bluff. You've got
to take the head of the table.

189
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,351
If you show them you're a leader,
you're a leader.

190
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,308
Wannabe business coach!

191
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,749
I can take the head of the table.
- Great. What's the problem then?

192
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,117
Hey, you.
What's going on, Laura?

193
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,353
Leave him alone.
Kids, listen up!

194
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,197
Hey, we're talking. If you want to beat
each other up, go somewhere else.

195
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,354
See? That's taking
the head of the table.

196
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,711
We have to have a serious talk
with the kids if I make PM.

197
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,271
Not if... when.
Positive vibes.

198
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,117
I mean it. It'll change everything.

199
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,792
They know.
I'll talk to them.

200
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,910
You and I need to talk, too.

201
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,595
We made a deal back then.
- Sure.

202
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,392
But this is different.
Completely out of the loop.

203
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,835
Why?

204
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,274
I'm not going to tell my wife
I don't want her to be PM.

205
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,195
Who wants to tell his wife that?

206
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,517
What are you doing?
- Taking the head of the table.

207
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,234
Hi.
- Good morning, beautiful.

208
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,749
I thought you'd be out here
punishing yourself.

209
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,832
Water?
- Thanks.

210
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,715
What did you want?
- Nothing.

211
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,190
Just to talk.
Is everything okay?

212
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,794
No, everything's crap.

213
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,397
Sometimes I miss him so much
I don't know who I am.

214
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,109
How did you leave him
after I took the cab?

215
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,912
I just removed all signs of him
not being alone when he died.

216
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,833
Are you okay?

217
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,232
I don't work
for the Moderates anymore.

218
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,153
Just thought you should know.

219
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,756
You got fired?
- No way. I quit.

220
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,718
They're just too PC.

221
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,190
Officially, I left because
of a mutual disagreement.

222
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,715
Are you upset?
- No.

223
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,916
Know where Laugesen
got the receipts that nailed the PM?

224
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,234
He must have had a source
at the Prime Minister's Office. Why?

225
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,791
No reason. It's just that
I'm not in the know anymore.

226
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,593
I have to be at work in a hour.
This was nice of you. See you.

227
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,957
Breakfast sometime?

228
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,914
Good morning. The light was on
all night over at Labour's.

229
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,356
Laugesen is mounting
his strongest team.

230
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,991
Unless we have a concrete offer,
he'll smell blood.

231
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,913
I'm not bowing down on integration.

232
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,868
They can have the Ministries of
Finance, Justice and Foreign Affairs.

233
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,352
We'll take Economic and Business
Affairs, Education and Culture.

234
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,396
Are we early?
- Not at all.

235
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,714
Michael, Hoxenhaven, Marrot.
Sit down.

236
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
Congratulations again.
- Thanks.

237
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,357
Have you gone vegan on me?
Can't a guy get his pastry?

238
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,114
Let's get straight to work.

239
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:26,116
We met with the Greens
and the Solidarity Party yesterday.

240
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,034
I didn't want to get into the specifics
until we'd met.

241
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,558
Let me give you an overview...

242
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,999
I respect your position
as the royal investigator.

243
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,994
If Labour hadn't gotten back in step -

244
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,153
you'd have been an obvious PM.

245
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,271
Excuse me, but what is going on?

246
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,753
Labour and I want you to tell the
Queen your negotiations have failed -

247
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,993
so you're proposing me
as the new investigator.

248
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,439
Why on earth should I do that?
- I doubt you'll propose Hesselboe.

249
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,753
Besides, we're the largest party.

250
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,708
Of course
we should head the cabinet.

251
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,394
You've never been smaller.

252
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,588
Yesterday, I negotiated
with the Greens and Solidarity.

253
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,594
They're both proposing me as PM.

254
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,596
Birgitte, your day will come.
And we have a concrete offer for you.

255
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,153
Send the papers round, please.
Solidarity is out of the question.

256
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,959
It's down to us, you and the Greens.

257
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,478
Amir gets the Ministry of Environment
and Health and other little titbits.

258
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,315
We're offering you
Economy and Business Affairs -

259
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,517
Employment
and four soft ones.

260
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,195
You take the Prime Minister's Office
and Finance and Foreign Affairs?

261
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,753
Well, it's just a proposal.
- No way. We can't work with this.

262
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,198
I forgot. You get Justice, too.
- But we just agreed...

263
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,238
Troels, we'll work it out, okay?

264
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,960
Negotiations will continue -

265
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,875
as soon as Birgitte has proposed me
to chair the negotiations.

266
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,639
We need to think about this.

267
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,918
We're going to form the cabinet
tomorrow, with or without you.

268
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,837
You're going to get seven seats
in the cabinet. Hello!

269
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,028
You can still look your voters
in the eye, Birgitte.

270
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,316
That's all for now. Coming?
- Yes.

271
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,554
I'll just grab an apple.
Organic?

272
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,234
Have a nice day.

273
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,356
Hi.

274
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,829
Hanne came to clear her table.
Pity, but I've got the brass behind me.

275
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,117
Are you okay?
- Sure. Thanks.

276
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,749
Hanne?
- What do you want?

277
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,356
I'm sad to lose you as a coworker.

278
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,991
I don't know who sent that e-mail
about you. I was shocked.

279
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,996
I'm the one who's shocked.
You take over the final debate -

280
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:56,917
and become the prime-time anchor.
You're not ready.

281
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,312
Still, the most depressing thing
is the way -

282
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,359
this entire staff has treated
the outcome of the election.

283
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,992
Ratings and free premiere tickets
mean more to you -

284
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,358
than critical journalism.
You're newsreaders, that's all.

285
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,116
We've all got to start somewhere.
- Great, so start somewhere.

286
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,479
Why did Labour and the Liberals
avoid meeting with the Moderates?

287
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,475
How did Laugesen get hold
of Hesselboe's receipts?

288
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,634
You don't care about the crucial stuff
pertaining to how this country is run.

289
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,432
You rant about party strife
and churn out glossy articles -

290
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,878
about when Birgitte Nyborg
headed the student council.

291
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,316
I just came to wish you good luck.

292
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,715
Katrine?
Just to satisfy my curiosity.

293
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,593
Was calling me a drunk
enough to get my job -

294
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,515
or did you have
to fuck the Head of News, too?

295
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,959
So, what are my options?
You always ask that.

296
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,238
Tell the Queen you want
to propose Laugesen as PM.

297
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,916
With the support of the other parties,
he's the opposition leader.

298
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,197
If you propose someone else,
you'll lose your credibility.

299
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,195
He's an unscrupulous bastard,
and he'll be a bastard of a boss, too.

300
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,672
Still, we get seven seats.
Not bad.

301
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,071
Birgitte, you did your best.

302
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,874
Good night, sweetie.

303
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,556
Are you okay?
- Yes. Thanks.

304
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,110
Good night.
- Sleep tight.

305
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,476
It's tough to be comforted by your kids
because you didn't make PM.

306
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,553
So you made Minister of Economy
and Business Affairs. Not bad, either.

307
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,518
Still, it's not the same.

308
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,831
Magnus said not to feel bad.

309
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,630
His P.E. Teacher said
second place was just as good.

310
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,992
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
No more shit.

311
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,232
There, it's gone.
- He pulled a classic Laugesen.

312
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,871
He always pulls these maneuvers.
- I should've known.

313
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,396
Drink my wine, why don't you?

314
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,758
Amina?

315
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:02,710
Does she write as well as she flirts?
- She's far better at flirting.

316
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,550
Something really bugs me, though.

317
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:17,831
I had so been looking forward
to the PM giving me a blowjob.

318
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,513
I'll ask if Laugesen's game.
- Please do.

319
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,679
Hallo.
- Birgitte Nyborg?

320
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,913
I've got information
that could bring Laugesen down.

321
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:43,269
Who is this?
- Not on the phone. Let's meet.

322
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,876
I don't want to meet with you,
if I don't know who you are.

323
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,352
Both you and Bent Sejro will find
my information very interesting.

324
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,116
The future of the nation is at stake.
10 o'clock at the Marble Bridge?

325
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,840
Okay.

326
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,953
What was that all about?

327
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,150
A mint?
- No thanks.

328
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,553
Want me to come?
- No.

329
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,234
Troels?

330
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,756
I'm sorry about this,
but I'm not taking any chances.

331
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:07,517
What would you do, if Laugesen
were forced to stand down -

332
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,797
as leader of the party tomorrow?

333
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,235
But how?

334
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,317
Would you support a new party leader
to head the cabinet?

335
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,472
That depends on who.

336
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,158
If Laugesen stands down, he'll be
succeeded by a deputy leader.

337
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,231
You or Bjorn Marrot?
- Bjorn isn't cut out to be a leader.

338
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,235
He's got no popular support.
He's Laugesen's flunkey.

339
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,349
So you want to be prime minister?

340
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,318
How are you going
to topple Laugesen?

341
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,235
I've got an e-mail correspondance
between Laugesen and his cronies.

342
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,678
Read it for yourself.
The press is going to have a field day.

343
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,077
"The sight of Aicha from
the Solidarity Party makes me sick -

344
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,232
when she wears her fanatical scarf -

345
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,757
promoting a medieval
anti-democratic religion. "

346
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,959
How do I know these are real?
- I've got them all in my computer.

347
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,953
And that's only the beginning.

348
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,795
He's going to ban
head scarves in public -

349
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,235
if he comes to power.

350
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,518
He wouldn't dare.
- Are you willing to chance it?

351
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:37,357
This correspondance is more
than enough to topple him.

352
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,878
But I need your support
to make it worth the trouble.

353
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,878
I have to talk to Sejro about it.
- Let me know before midnight.

354
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,157
I want it to hit the news tomorrow.

355
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,278
We want Foreign Affairs, too.
- Deal.

356
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,238
I'll be in touch.

357
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,156
I knew I had some left.

358
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,438
This is one of the most insane
political tackles I've ever seen.

359
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,071
Hox has been a loyal party man for
20 years. Laugesen's avid supporter.

360
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,630
Caesar was murdered
by his friends, too.

361
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,597
I feel a history lesson coming on.
- I want to show you something.

362
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,309
We've got several old dynasties
here at Parliament.

363
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,758
Troels is
a fourth generation Hoxenhaven.

364
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,277
His great-grandfather Eugén
was a cabinet member in 1915-

365
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,716
and thought he was going
to be Minister of Justice.

366
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,590
Zahle had promised him so,
but the rascal went back on his word.

367
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,595
There's old Hoxenhaven.
See the bitter look on his face?

368
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,356
He was cheated. Zahle made himself
both PM and Minister of Justice.

369
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,229
That's the closest the family's
ever been to a ministry.

370
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,757
And Laugesen had in fact promised
Hox the Ministry of Justice.

371
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,708
Precisely.
Hox sees history repeating itself.

372
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,634
Laugesen is going to form his cabinet
tomorrow, so unless Hox acts -

373
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,190
he'll never make minister.

374
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,557
Well?

375
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,234
You're the party leader.

376
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,871
I don't want Laugesen to be
the next PM of Denmark.

377
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,758
Troels, it's Birgitte. We're in.
See you at the funeral tomorrow.

378
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,960
Katrine?

379
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,998
Katrine?

380
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,551
Hi, Mom. What time is it?
- Nearly ten.

381
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,190
What are you doing here?
- You don't return my calls.

382
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,318
You've looked a mess lately.

383
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,268
But we haven't seen each other.
- I see you every night on TV.

384
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,749
You can't tell anything on TV.

385
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,710
I'm going to make coffee.
- I've only got instant.

386
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,599
Got any milk?
- Sure.

387
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,949
No.

388
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,714
Have you got boyfriend troubles?
- No.

389
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,955
Who died?

390
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,519
Oh, sweetie.

391
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,596
I loved him so much, Mom.

392
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,749
He died right next to me.
He had a bad heart, but I didn't know.

393
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,637
When is the funeral?
- Today.

394
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,473
I can't go.

395
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,349
He was married, Mom.

396
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,991
He had a wife and two young children.
They didn't know.

397
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,073
They didn't know.

398
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,273
You have to say goodbye.

399
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,037
Haven't you got a girlfriend
you can bring? A really good friend?

400
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,794
There's nothing about it in the papers.
What's going on?

401
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,191
Damn it.
- Bent, you're in a church.

402
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,639
Okay. So he got cold feet.

403
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,591
When someone is taken from us
far too early -

404
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,197
we are overwhelmed
by the senselessness.

405
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,469
But even when it makes no sense,
even in our darkest hour -

406
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,760
love prevails.
Resurrection prevails.

407
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,355
That is why Paul wrote in his
first epistle to the Corinthians:

408
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,029
"Death...
Death is swallowed up in victory. "

409
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,590
"0 death, where is thy sting?"

410
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,115
"0 death, where is thy victory?"

411
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,238
The widow would like
to say a few words.

412
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,439
Labour demands Laugesen's exit
after racist statements!

413
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,276
Ole's life was one of politics.

414
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,118
And so, clearly, is his funeral.

415
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,716
He wouldn't have wanted it
any other way.

416
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,589
He loved the battles and the game.

417
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,672
When you loved Ole like I did -

418
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,879
you always knew
you had an awesome rival.

419
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,194
Parliament.
Ole loved Parliament.

420
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,753
And Parliament could be
a demanding mistress craving him -

421
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,629
both day and night
now and then.

422
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,272
But Ole was a fantastic father to our
children, too, and a wonderful man.

423
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,796
They were internal and confidential.
So find out!

424
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,076
I'll call you.

425
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,279
Have you told anyone
about the info on the PM?

426
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,035
Just how important
do you think you are, fuckhead?

427
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,317
Who the fuck cares now, you idiot?

428
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,914
Michael.

429
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,718
Katrine?

430
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,795
I'd like to apologize
for that last remark yesterday.

431
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,389
What's the matter, honey?

432
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,517
Sorry. I'm okay.

433
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:47,551
You bastard!
You promised to stay with me.

434
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,356
Ready?

435
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,876
Laugesen just stood down
as party leader -

436
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,794
- thereby suspending
the pending cabinet formation.

437
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,236
Hoxenhaven doesn't answer.

438
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,869
Who keeps buying cake?

439
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,833
What if they don't choose Hox?

440
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,117
They will. Or else we're done for.

441
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,635
Hi, Katrine.

442
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,874
Katrine, are you up-to-date on this?

443
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,795
We expect to present the new leader
and potential PM at six.

444
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,956
Right now, we're compiling portraits
of both Hoxenhaven and Marrot.

445
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,838
Something's wrong with my
hydrangeas at the back of the garden.

446
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,391
They used to be blue,
but now they've turned pink.

447
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,872
Maybe the soil's gone sour, or...

448
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,110
Bent...

449
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,159
Just shut up, will you?
- Okay.

450
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,039
15 seconds. Katrine, dab your face.
You're sweating.

451
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,990
Mona, got a Kleenex?
- It's not like her to sweat.

452
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,078
And we're on in 5 seconds.
4, 3, 2, 1, go.

453
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,199
The results are just in
from Parliament.

454
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,433
Labour's new leader is Bjorn Marrot.
That is the result -

455
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,230
- after hours of debate
and a very close vote.

456
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:42,153
What's going on, Bent?

457
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,835
What the hell is going on?
- Easy, easy, easy.

458
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,276
Take it easy.
You did all you could.

459
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,477
Easy now.
You did all you could.

460
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,160
I don't want to talk to the press
until all the pieces are in place.

461
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,473
Good evening.

462
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,792
Bjorn, congratulations. I've always
appreciated working with you.

463
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,872
Let's get Denmark back on track.

464
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,315
Sit down.

465
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,999
Birgitte, Bent and Amir.

466
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,676
You've all voiced your support for
a cabinet headed by Labour and me.

467
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,276
I have yet to draw up a proposal -

468
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,989
but I have a unified Labour Party -

469
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,436
behind me
and thus a coming cabinet.

470
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,469
We can go ahead with most of the
items agreed upon with Laugesen.

471
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,033
Amir, you know which ministries
you and the Greens were promised.

472
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,078
Bjorn, I can't support you.

473
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,592
What?
- You're not cut out to be the PM.

474
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,509
What are you saying?

475
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,719
Bjorn is a gifted politician,
but no leader.

476
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,949
Now is not the time
to become personal.

477
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,671
We're talking about the PM. It doesn't
get any more personal than that.

478
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,118
So who's going to form the cabinet?
Birgitte, you can'tjust walk out.

479
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,716
We have to work together on this.

480
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,953
The Queen will have to appoint a new
investigator. We can't support this.

481
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,078
I'm sorry, Bjorn.

482
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,959
Good bye.

483
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,553
Damn, you're a good man.

484
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,110
Why is it I don't spend more time
at home with you?

485
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,955
Because you're an ambitious bitch.

486
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,597
How do the kids feel about all this?
I only see them when they're asleep.

487
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,035
They're okay.

488
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,557
Magnus does think
you're away too much.

489
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,794
Maybe it's a good thing
I didn't make PM then.

490
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,233
What will you make?
- Nothing.

491
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,871
I'm the girl who got the Moderates
15 seats to no avail.

492
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,195
Okay. Are you going to wallow in the
Hesselboes along with the rest of us?

493
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,079
The former MP and his wife
are baring all on 'Focus' tonight -

494
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,028
about his wife's pill abuse
and whatever.

495
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,668
Yup.

496
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,276
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

497
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,308
You do know Ulrik is hosting
tonight's show, I hope?

498
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,917
I'm afraid Hanne Holm quit last week.

499
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,710
I heard about that.
She had a drinking problem, right?

500
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,395
Yes, well...
You're not alone.

501
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,830
You start taking pills
because you're unhappy.

502
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,197
But it got out of control.

503
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,909
Lars has been a great support to me.

504
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,313
How does one lose control?
I snapped that day in London.

505
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,429
And it's in that light one must
consider my 'wrongdoing' -

506
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,515
when I used my official Eurocard.
I've long paid back the money.

507
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,391
Unfortunately,
Laugesen got hold of the receipt.

508
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,634
But that backfired on Laugesen, who
has now stood down as party leader.

509
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,836
Yes, and rightly so.

510
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,074
The brutalization he stood for
does democracy no good.

511
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,549
Not that that acquits me.

512
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,951
My position as prime minister -

513
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,829
caused me to neglect
Lisbeth's problems -

514
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,993
- and for that I owe you an apology.

515
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,993
Still, our wrongdoings aside -

516
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,919
I have no doubt that we've come out
of this a stronger couple.

517
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,119
And on that note
we bid you goodbye.

518
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,308
Stay tuned for the News.
Have a nice evening.

519
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,353
I think they came off well.
In an eeriely controlled fashion.

520
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,198
Promise me it's not us in ten years.
- We can get there much faster.

521
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,553
Hello.
- This is Lars Hesselboe.

522
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,996
I promised my wife
not to talk all night.

523
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,075
Would you like to pop by
our office tomorrow at ten?

524
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,872
I gather It didn't work out
with Marrot, so I think we should talk.

525
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,396
Fine. See you tomorrow.

526
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,679
Birgitte Nyborg?
You're meeting Lars Hesselboe?

527
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,311
He told me to ask you
to come to the PM's office instead.

528
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,869
Okay. Sure.

529
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,109
Let me take your coat.
- Thanks.

530
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,477
Thanks. Hi.

531
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,634
Birgitte, I'm so glad
you could come at such short notice.

532
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,031
Sit down.
- Hello, Birgitte.

533
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,193
Yvonne brought her
frighteningly good cookies.

534
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,955
Spéculoos.
It's a Belgian recipe.

535
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,352
Let me get straight to the point.
The left wing is paralyzed.

536
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,957
You caused the card house to collapse
when you refused to support Marrot.

537
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,634
A very brave decision -

538
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,873
which has, however, left the country
in a political vacuum.

539
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,554
I feel a great responsibility.

540
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,748
Denmark deserves a strong new
cabinet after these turbulent days.

541
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:11,153
We want to form a right-wing
liberal three-party coalition cabinet.

542
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,596
We have a concrete offer for you.

543
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,834
We're offering you Health,
Education and Culture.

544
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,470
You yourself get
the Ministry of Business Affairs -

545
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,633
in close collaboration
with Yvonne's Ministry of Economy.

546
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:34,035
We'd also like you to set up a new
Ministry of International Development.

547
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,671
I'd be honored to bring national
politics back where they belong -

548
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,037
at the center of Parliament.

549
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,359
I have to discuss it with the Party.
- Of course.

550
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,593
We weren't expecting an answer now.
At 4 this afternoon?

551
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,390
I can't wait to get to work.
Now, let's have one of those cookies.

552
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,194
You did it again.

553
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:17,552
Okay, Bent. Half an hour ago
I met with the PM.

554
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,918
The PM?
- Well, acting PM Lars Hesselboe.

555
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,915
He offered us to form a cabinet
with him and get five seats.

556
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:30,959
As I see it,
this is our best chance.

557
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:36,353
We push the Freedom Party aside and
start doing some real political work.

558
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,229
You can't be serious, Birgitte.

559
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,355
Excuse me for a second.

560
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:56,070
You met at the PM's Office?
Why not at the Liberals' own office?

561
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,392
Hesselboe had some errands up there.

562
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,918
Hesselboe just happened to round up
some cookies and heavy ministers -

563
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,550
for a little chat with you?

564
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,316
He looked quite the PM, didn't he?
He pulled a power bluff on you.

565
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,109
Hesselboe is crap
without your support.

566
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,192
His is a minority party.

567
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,319
It's just like the man
who went to market with a cow -

568
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:29,109
and came back with a chicken.

569
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,589
How long have you been here?

570
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,958
You let yourself be duped
by a new ministry?

571
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,797
They constantly cut back
on international development.

572
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,275
Come here.

573
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,510
All this can be yours.

574
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,195
But power isn't a cute little lapdog.

575
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,354
You have to grab it and hold on to it,
or it'll be gone before you know it.

576
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,036
The only relevant question is:
Who can count to 90?

577
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,312
Who can count to 90, Birgitte?

578
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,074
I can.

579
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,993
Do you dare?

580
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,517
From now on you don't have
any friends in Parliament.

581
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:47,630
You must be able to fire anyone
without hesitation.

582
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,633
Can I keep you as my friend?

583
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,349
Sure, I'm a thing of the past anyway.

584
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:57,550
What are your options?

585
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,191
I'm going to call in Labour
and the Greens right away.

586
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:07,354
How does your list of ministers look?
- It looks good.

587
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,996
I'm not sure we can accept that.

588
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,754
You don't have a choice.

589
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:28,629
We want to form a coalition with you,
but with me as the PM.

590
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,352
Or else I'm going to go
with Hesselboe.

591
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,797
I'll be PM.
Sejro Minister of Finance -

592
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,919
Bjorn Minister of Foreign Affairs,
Amir Minister of Climate and Energy -

593
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:48,518
Hoxenhaven Minister of Justice.
50% of the cabinet seats go to women.

594
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,717
We want the ministries we asked for.

595
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,192
You get the ministries we agree upon.
This is my proposal.

596
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,510
I was supposed to get back
to Hesselboe some time ago -

597
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,513
so we haven't got all day.

598
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,673
Is that a yes, Bjorn?
- Yes, we're in.

599
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,957
Amir?
- Three ministries are not enough.

600
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,556
I can't go back to my party with this.

601
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,633
Oh, it should say four ministries.

602
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,874
The new Ministry of International
Development goes to you, too.

603
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,551
Okay.
- Have we got a deal?

604
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,918
Hesselboe says you had
an appointment seven minutes ago.

605
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,153
Ask him to come down in 15 minutes,
and then we'll go next door.

606
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,754
No thanks.

607
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:54,271
Hesselboe is here.
- Thanks.

608
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,873
Birgitte. I rather prefer my ministers
to keep their appointments.

609
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:04,114
I apologize.
- No matter. This is a great day.

610
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,469
We've gone over your proposal,
and I'm afraid I have to let you down.

611
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,792
We're going to support another PM.

612
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,078
Who, if I may ask?
- Me.

613
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,840
Okay.

614
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,830
PREGNANCY TEST

615
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,390
Katrine Fonsmark,
please go to the studio.

616
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,076
I don't know where the hell she is.
Katrine, you can't come this late.

617
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,789
We get nervous.
- Sorry.

618
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,430
We're on in 5 seconds.
4, 3, 2, 1, go.

619
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,833
Today, Denmark got
its first female Prime Minister.

620
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,470
Birgitte Nyborg just presented
Denmark's new cabinet -

621
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,838
- a coalition between the Greens,
Labour and the Moderates.

622
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,870
The cabinet is younger than ever.
50/% of the seats are held by women.

623
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,636
Here we are. Boy, have I been
looking forward to saying:

624
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,951
Denmark has got a new government.

625
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,000
