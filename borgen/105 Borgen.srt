1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,478
Perhaps it was naive of me to think I
wouldn't lie during my first 100 days.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,632
What's up?
- I can't tell you.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,633
Who was that on the phone?
- I can't tell you.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,713
This is going to be hard.
- Let's just keep it personal then.

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,509
Maybe you need to talk about
the child you just lost.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,070
We haven't had sex in three weeks.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,153
We could have regular days.
Tuesdays and Saturdays?

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,154
Scheduled sex with the PM?

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,512
"All armed prophets
have been victorious. "

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,070
"All unarmed have been destroyed. "
- Machiavelli

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,829
Jesus Christ.
Let me see if I've got this right.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,835
You want quotas ensuring 50% women
on the boards of Danish companies.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,949
It's old news, Bent.
- It just reads a little drastic.

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,671
It'll say 45% in the bill.
A mere technicality.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,038
A board of 7 can't have 50% women.
- I don't get it.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,436
It's simple math. 45% enables boards
to have an uneven composition.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,275
Will you use force?
- We hope it won't be necessary.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,910
It might be.
- I agree.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,596
This has been part of our
cabinet policy from the very start.

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,790
I thought we might moderate it.
- We're introducing it tomorrow.

21
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,593
Surely this falls under my Ministry
for Social Affairs and Gender Equality.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,991
I see it as
a political economy initiative.

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,438
Not simply a gender equality issue.
- You call gender equality simple?

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,754
This was just to brief you.
The final bill may look different.

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,310
Let's call it a night.
- Why wasn't I informed?

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,837
Ask Bent.
- Why wasn't I informed?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,959
Don't oppose the bill
the night before the press conference.

28
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,032
Your Permanent Secretary
wasn't thrilled.

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,751
Permanent secretaries
are opposed to change.

30
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,595
So I cannot have other gods than you?
No thanks.

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,676
What's up with you and Henriette
Klitgaard? You keep looking at her.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,831
How do you mean?

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,271
You don't see her as minister.
- I see her as a hot minister.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,716
Let's go through
the press release again.

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,395
It's 10:30.
Get a life, okay?

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,156
Good night, Sanne.
- Good night. Bye.

37
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,073
GOVERNMENT
Episode 5- Men Who Love Women

38
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,478
Dad, where's my note book?
- I have no idea.

39
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,236
Well?

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,916
It screams state regulation.
- It is state regulation.

41
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,275
You're in for a beating.

42
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,638
What will they attack?
- You, for proposing it.

43
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,079
It's Henriette Klitgaard's bill.
- She's a woman, too, and what, 38?

44
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,916
She's got a PhD in market economy
and an MBA from Princeton.

45
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,949
How do you know?
- I worked with her at Simtech.

46
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,750
She was an intern.
- It's Henriette's show today.

47
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,992
They're going to rage
about your feminist agenda.

48
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,631
When women become executives,
they must apologize for being women.

49
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,670
They must be overly skilled
and promise never to favor women.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,753
Men don't force you
to beg for their approval.

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,118
I've never asked for a man's approval.
How do I look?

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,555
Fine. Fine from the back, too.
- Thanks.

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,276
We expect to have the bill passed
before the summer break.

54
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,116
Thank you.
- Thank you. Any questions?

55
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,193
Will this be compulsory for boards
in the public sector, too?

56
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,636
The Danish laws apply to everyone.

57
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,794
To the composition of the cabinet
and Parliament, too?

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,349
My party meets the quota.

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,594
Parliament is composed by the voters.
I'm not messing with the Constitution.

60
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,595
You're both highly educated women
leaders. Isn't this bill redundant?

61
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,591
May I?

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,914
Only 1.5% of the top executive
positions are held by women.

63
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,719
The people elected our PM.

64
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,318
They must be far more progressive
than the corporate world.

65
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,196
And sit down.
Pedal hard.

66
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,556
I said: Sit down.

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,670
Excuse me. I'm Benjamin,
the new instructor.

68
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,516
If you want to do your own thing,
please sit at the back.

69
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,796
Hey, sure.

70
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,875
And remember to bring some water.
It's unhealthy not to drink anything.

71
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,953
Is that your breakfast?
- Yes.

72
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,477
I can help you with your diet.
- Gee, thanks.

73
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,760
I don't eat croissants to stay healthy,
but to clog up my veins.

74
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,357
Well, get him to call back, dammit.

75
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,399
Get Klitgaard in for an interview.
- The Clit.

76
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,233
That's what they call her.

77
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,836
We call her
the Minister for Economic Affairs.

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,836
She's a former model.
Four degrees from foreign universities.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,879
The mother of four, and not yet 40.
- I bet she can't cook.

80
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,636
She's the only minister
not voted into Parliament.

81
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,828
The PM headhunted her from
a top position in the corporate sector.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,151
We'll put her to the test tonight.
At 6 eller 8:30?

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,314
I'll take her in the 6 o'clock news.
- What makes the best TV?

84
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,634
What looks best? In terms
of journalism. You've got something...

85
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,557
It's a feminist bill. Do we pair her
with a woman and go girl power?

86
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,635
Or should I take her in the 8:30?
- She looks great. You've got a point.

87
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,954
Girl power? You want to postpone
the story, so a man can interview her?

88
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,070
It's a story about favoring women.
Pairing her with you is overkill.

89
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,110
Since when did gender
interfere with our reporting?

90
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,751
Hey, this case is all about gender.
- It's all about equality.

91
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,710
You won't let Katrine take it
because she's a woman. Come on!

92
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,873
It's grotesque.
- I'll gladly take her.

93
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,476
What'll it be then?

94
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,108
Ulrik, 8:30.
- No!

95
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,159
We expect to pass the bill
before the summer break.

96
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,031
Aren't quotas more for flounder?
- He's good!

97
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,636
Quotas are useful in areas
that don't self-regulate.

98
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,032
You have quotas for students,
and not all students are flounders.

99
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,389
Take that, Ulrik.
- So, women need a bill to get ahead?

100
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,795
We need to break down the closed
systems of the corporate world -

101
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,351
so highly educated women don't
have to wait for things to change.

102
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,195
We legislate on maternity
and paternity leave.

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,275
The Royals embrace gender equality.
It's nothing to be scared of, Ulrik.

104
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,910
Henriette...
- She has him eating out of her hand.

105
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,914
Well, that girl is sizzling!

106
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,595
The carrot is tax benefits
for the companies -

107
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,230
that quickly let women
onto their boards.

108
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,552
The stick is harsher taxation
of the companies that won't.

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,316
We may even take away their right
to operate in Denmark.

110
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,995
Hopefully the carrot will be enough.
- Give her hell!

111
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,549
Thank you.

112
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,111
Now, from quotas and bills
to speeches and battle songs.

113
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,475
Today is Women's Day -

114
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,394
and our reporter has hit
the streets... wearing a bra.

115
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,912
Hey. Long day.
- Yes.

116
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,950
Katrine... I want to apologize
for this morning.

117
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,159
I didn't mean to criticize.
You can eat whatever you want.

118
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,393
Yes, and now I'd like to go home,
if that's okay with you.

119
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,954
It's that tough to be famous?
- What?

120
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,513
That you won't even chat
with a mere fitness instructor?

121
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,468
I apologize,
and you treat me like a stalker.

122
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,756
But I'm not.

123
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,473
I didn't even recognize you
this morning. I don't really watch TV.

124
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:59,512
And I like that other news anchor
better... Ulrik Mørk.

125
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,436
Why do you like Ulrik better?
- He gives people a chance.

126
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,070
Hey, Benjamin...

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,356
What are you eating?
- Coco Pops.

128
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,751
I was no match
for his pester power yesterday.

129
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,674
Do you want the headlines?
- Hit me.

130
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,071
"Violent protests in Burma. "

131
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,552
"The National Bank
raises interest rates. "

132
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,756
And...

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,030
Okay.

134
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,358
Who's that?
- The Minister for Economic Affairs.

135
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,592
Why isn't she wearing any clothes?

136
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,916
Now it begins.

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,230
ONE FOR THE BOARD, BOYS?

138
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,838
Hi. Good morning.

139
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,390
I got you the breakfast complet.
- Thanks.

140
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,352
No croissant for me.
- Are you ill?

141
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,036
No. I'm just trying
to eat wholesome food.

142
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,316
I really just want some water.
- Water?

143
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,870
Things are that bad
in the TV business?

144
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,195
The staff meetings are a stag party.
- At my job it's a hen party.

145
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,117
Economy Henriette is hot. She gives
a girl an instant inferiority complex.

146
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,273
Pernille Madsen feels the same way.

147
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,399
Well, it ought to fall under
her Ministry for Gender Equality.

148
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,518
My lips are sealed.

149
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,509
She's mad as hell.
But that's confidential, okay?

150
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,800
Now tell me about yourself.
- The facts, or what you want to hear?

151
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,556
What do I want to hear?
- That I'm celibate.

152
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,592
And that I miss an old friend.

153
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,474
And that I don't mean Ole.

154
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,913
I liked Ole.

155
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,629
But you like the thought
of being hard to get over, too.

156
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,309
Bull.

157
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,519
I was a model, 21,
and I needed the money.

158
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,514
Is there more than that?
- I was never Miss Wet T-Shirt.

159
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,276
I only worked for the big agencies,
and I did a lot of lingeri shoots.

160
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,639
Let's meet and work out a press
strategy about your modeling past.

161
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,156
Rune can handle it.

162
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,996
The media is on this, so coordinate
all announcements with us.

163
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,479
"Let's meet and work out a press
strategy about your modeling past. "

164
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,760
"I'd so like to help you
with your press strategy. "

165
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,029
Birgitte, I'm not flirting.
- You're flirting. You are so flirting.

166
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,671
Sanne, am I flirting?
- Not with me.

167
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,834
Pernille Madsen wants to meet
with you. She's been very persistent.

168
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,878
I'll call her.

169
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,473
Pernille Madsen has got a point.

170
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,553
She's the Minister for Gender Equality,
and we're keeping her out of it.

171
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,474
Fire her.
I can't stand Pernille Madsen.

172
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,757
Why not?
- She's a stale old bra-burner.

173
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,232
She's the essence of redstockings,
hairy armpits and cold meatloaf.

174
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,279
I just can't stand her.
- Talk to your shrink about that, okay?

175
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,639
Those women are the first up against
the wall, when the revolution comes.

176
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,270
You asked, I answered.

177
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,713
Boy, you're a flirt.

178
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,354
I'm glad you had time for a chat.

179
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:24,231
Labour doesn't understand why you
chose Henriette to pitch your bill.

180
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,428
The party leaders can come to me.
- We are. I'm deputy leader.

181
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,799
Why hand a gender equality issue
to the Ministry for Economic Affairs?

182
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,829
I want to shift the debate focus.
My choice of ministry was tactical.

183
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,471
She has the corporate world's respect,
and that makes us less vulnerable.

184
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,872
You think so?
She's a former lingeri model.

185
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,476
They'd never have dug out
pictures like that of me.

186
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,397
Why don't you keep your own
promise about gender equality?

187
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,599
The Coordinating Committee has
only two women members.

188
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,392
You? The Minister for Social Affairs
has never been on the C Committee.

189
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,269
I've got lots of clout in Labour.

190
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,115
We'd hate to create unrest
in the government.

191
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,479
You owe me
for favoring Henriette with this bill.

192
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,873
What do you want?
- Access to all related meetings.

193
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,390
And I want to be first in line for the
committee at the next cabinet rotation.

194
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,753
Nice chatting with you.

195
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,075
We've been approached
by Crohne Industries.

196
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,679
He wants to meet with you.
How about at 6 this afternoon?

197
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,677
It's hard to set up a meeting
with the PM, isn't it?

198
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,957
And yet you offer him a meeting
the day he calls.

199
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,714
We always meet with Crohne.
- We?

200
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,519
This office.

201
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,798
I know Hesselboe met with him.
- They were on good terms.

202
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,715
The press said Crohne dictated
the government's corporate tax policy.

203
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,955
Crohne is one of the most
powerful people in Denmark.

204
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,433
Is 6 p. m. Okay?
- No, I'm eating dinner at home.

205
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,916
I can be here at 8.
- Good.

206
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,033
How did you do on the test?
- Fine. I got an A.

207
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,830
Great! Congratulations.
- I got an A on the last one, too.

208
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,709
Can I play my computer game?
- No, this is family time.

209
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,112
Got any homework?
Run along, then.

210
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:06,512
Can I practice the piano?
I promise to wear headphones.

211
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,713
Who the hell invented the concept
of quality time? Sick bastard.

212
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,113
You've been away a lot. Tonight
they'll be all over you on the couch.

213
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,512
I've got a meeting.
- Oh.

214
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,072
Guess who.
- Who?

215
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,595
Joachim Crohne.

216
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,834
Okay. He's used to influencing
our country's legislation.

217
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,595
My Permanent Secretary insisted.
- Of course.

218
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,117
He's a member of the same
corporate network as Crohne's CEO.

219
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,319
Corporate Group No. 3.
- Oh, I see.

220
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,319
Is that a bad thing for democracy?

221
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,589
Ministers and civil servants shouldn't
get intimate with the corporate world.

222
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,278
Do we have to get a divorce, then?
- I'm not a CEO. I just teach.

223
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,592
It provokes me to see you
doll yourself up for another man.

224
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,070
For Crohne?
He's about 600 years old.

225
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,994
You always liked mature men.

226
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,033
Hurry home.

227
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,959
Good evening. This way.

228
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,952
We do understand that you
being the first Danish women PM -

229
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,636
feel compelled to fight
for women's rights.

230
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,918
However, it's always been
an executive right -

231
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,958
to pick the board members.

232
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,592
It still is. Only now,
50% of them have to be women.

233
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,239
When a symphony orchestra
chooses a new violinist -

234
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,233
they place a screen on stage -

235
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,870
behind which the candidate plays.

236
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,634
At the end they choose the best.

237
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,997
Not the best man
nor the best woman -

238
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,072
but the best violinist.

239
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,994
But nobody picks board members
that way.

240
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,993
We do.
- Okay.

241
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,030
Then why hasn't the number
of women executives changed?

242
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,671
Women are better and
more highly educated than men -

243
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,197
and there are more competent
women to choose from.

244
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,273
All good things come
to those who wait.

245
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,753
How long then? It took women
almost 70 years to get the vote.

246
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,912
Many boards are made up
solely of men.

247
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,428
They call in one of the old boys,
when they need a new member.

248
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,436
We will not be forced
to give up our freedom of choice.

249
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,513
This country's laws apply
to all Danish companies.

250
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,639
Exactly.
So this could result in -

251
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,749
the Crohne corporation moving
its activities abroad.

252
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,469
I sympathize with your proposal.

253
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:10,318
But we are a billion dollar corporation
up against tough competition.

254
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,109
We can't risk our companies
being run by incompetents -

255
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,034
because of state intervention.

256
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,352
Is that a threat?
- Not at all.

257
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,469
Your business is standpoints.
We have to live with the results -

258
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,679
and as such have
to take our precautions.

259
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,832
Take some time to consider it.

260
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,195
I'd like to hear your response
within 48 hours.

261
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,710
I know my way out.

262
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,195
They have?
I thought it was Monday.

263
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,669
Fine. Bye.

264
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,150
I just met with Crohne.

265
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,199
He threatened to move
his activities abroad -

266
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,750
if we pass the bill.

267
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,593
Christ!

268
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,114
I warned you.
- We must take this seriously.

269
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,637
It's an unreasonable response
to a bill he doesn't know in detail.

270
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,918
I think it's a reaction
to the introduction of the bill.

271
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,993
I doubt Crohne is that rash.

272
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,913
Maybe the bill went too far.

273
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,358
We could have given them two years'
warning and only said 30% women.

274
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,830
Call yourself
the Minister of Gender Equality?

275
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,118
That would be admitting
men's first claim to the boards.

276
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,070
Are we talking equality or not?
- I think we get the point.

277
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,668
We have to change our policy, Birgitte.
We have to.

278
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,953
It's lousy PR to withdraw the bill
because of a little resistance.

279
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,671
Crohne accounts for 11%
of the Danish gross national income.

280
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,593
11%.

281
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,834
And when Crohne says 'jump', the
corporative world says 'how high?'.

282
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,152
So we should let Crohne
dictate the law of the land?

283
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,915
No, but that's just the way it is.
He's stronger.

284
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,436
We stand to lose DKK 170b.

285
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,718
Not to mention a lot of jobs.

286
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:00,636
It's going to be fun to pitch that
as a positive to the business dailies.

287
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,592
Crohne gave us 48 hours.

288
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,753
Let's go on as if nothing happened.
- Play it tough.

289
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,311
If we bail the first time
anyone raises their voice, we've lost.

290
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,715
Beware, Birgitte.
- I won't let Crohne rattle my cage!

291
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,159
We may have to make concessions.

292
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,556
Maybe we can create a public opinion
forcing him to give us a better deal.

293
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,959
Nice shoes.
Louboutin is a genius.

294
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,954
Oh, you know about shoes, too.
Read fashion magazines?

295
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,513
No, I'm a know-all.
What is that tattoo on your ancle?

296
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,232
It's the Chinese sign for woman.
- In case you're in doubt.

297
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,949
It's more to get know-alls
to reveal their ignorance.

298
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,671
Dropping your pen on purpose
was lame.

299
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,150
But thanks for the compliment.

300
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,920
Have you got a moment?
- Sure.

301
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,958
Poor Henriette.
The press is having a field day.

302
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,793
It gets to her.
- You think?

303
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,839
She's very strident.

304
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,509
But then there is a lot of talk about
her among reporters and spin doctors.

305
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,358
People talk about her quick success...
with men.

306
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,753
Very nasty for her.
- We can't take it seriously.

307
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,199
Just say so, if you need me to relieve
her of some of her responsibilities.

308
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,716
If things comes to a head.

309
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,429
I don't see any reason
to change anything.

310
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,956
Let's not listen to gossip, okay?

311
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,558
Sure.
But what do I tell the press?

312
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,678
TV1 wants to interview me tomorrow.

313
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,392
They want to hear how I feel
about her taking over my area.

314
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,872
You can't.
- But I have to.

315
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,158
You can't display
our internal strife like that.

316
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,474
I'm sick of being on display...
- I'm your boss. I forbid it.

317
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,552
Call it off.

318
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,874
That's masculine leadership,
if I ever saw it.

319
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,160
I thought we talked things over.
- We did, and I made my decision.

320
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,549
Kasper. Come here.

321
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,757
Door.

322
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,037
How did TV1 get wind of the conflict
between Klitgaard and Madsen?

323
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,556
Find out.

324
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,549
Katrine, please pick up.
Call me, dammit.

325
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,156
Katrine. We need to talk.

326
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,472
What's up?
- It's confidential.

327
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,431
Benjamin is my spinning instructor.
- Spin off and let the grow-ups talk.

328
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,434
Hey!
- I need to talk to you. Now.

329
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,518
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

330
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,309
Nice talking to you.
- See you.

331
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,234
Don't talk to people like that.

332
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,915
Are you seeing him?
- Stop it.

333
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,631
Did you invite Pernille Madson
in for an interview -

334
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,952
because I told you about the conflict
between her and Klitgaard?

335
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,795
It's a good story.

336
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,112
I told you in confidence.
I said so.

337
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,718
Pernille is not going on the news.
- I love it when you bully me.

338
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,398
That's nothing against
a cabinet crisis. Goodbye.

339
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,676
Kasper.

340
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,836
This is why I left you. Your world
ends and begins with you.

341
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,912
Your priorities,
your secrets.

342
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,551
I have no secrets.
- You have nothing but.

343
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,635
Oh, come on.

344
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,590
Crohne threatens to pull out
of Denmark, if we pass the bill.

345
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,636
Sure.
He's a tough old bastard.

346
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,396
You think it's tough of him
to blackmail the PM?

347
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,634
No, but I told you
you were in for a beating.

348
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,316
Come here.
- Babe, I've got 48 hours.

349
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,750
What are you doing?

350
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,549
Getting to know all about Crohne.

351
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,350
I guess you need to take it seriously.

352
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,798
It's not just the gender thing.

353
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,114
It's because you're meddling
with the way he runs his business.

354
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,078
It's just a gambit.

355
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,438
Exactly. It's just like when
people go all in in a poker game.

356
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,071
They may not have a good hand,
but it'll cost you to find out.

357
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,074
Pokerjust isn't your game.
- Why not?

358
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,074
You can't bluff. You're a girl.
Am I wrong?

359
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,395
Hell yeah!
Girls bluff all the time.

360
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,199
Really?
- Sure.

361
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,150
I just need to check something...
- No, baby.

362
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,390
Look...

363
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,675
If you must work,
you'll have to go next door.

364
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,994
Okay. Good night.

365
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,995
What's this?
- Oatmeal.

366
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,431
With grated apple.
- Yuck.

367
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,479
It's called healthy food, and you
should try it before you turn 18.

368
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,757
No way.
- Coco Pops is for the weekend.

369
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,595
Your minister's been around, huh?
- Get dressed.

370
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,830
MY MANY MEN

371
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,911
Did you finish your work last night?

372
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,995
"Henriette had a sure plan
for getting ahead. "

373
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:48,470
"She carried it out on her back. "

374
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,632
"Several of her acquaintances say -

375
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,796
Henriette targeted powerful men
and made them her sex partners. "

376
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,796
They can't write that about a minister.
They make her sound like a whore.

377
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,750
Laugesen is at the helm of
the Express. They're unscrupulous.

378
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,472
It's libel.
- She may have been a fast girl.

379
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,236
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

380
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,429
What... Have you been with her?
- Stop it.

381
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,354
When you worked together.
You fucked her.

382
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,398
It's 17 years ago.
- You slept with my minister.

383
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:42,032
And you've been concealing it.
- We don't talk about all the...

384
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,398
About the people we've been with
before we met.

385
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,109
It was at a Christmas party.
We were drunk.

386
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:58,437
My Minister of Economic Affairs.
- She was a 21-year-old intern.

387
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,914
Go through my list of ministers and
check off those you've fucked, okay?

388
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,832
Sure.

389
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,759
Good morning.

390
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,680
Good morning.

391
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,079
Yes.
- This is completely over the top.

392
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,870
They've talked to some men
from your past.

393
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,989
It's classical chauvinism. It's okay
for a man to bed a lot of women.

394
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:57,235
If a woman does it, she's a whore.
- Well, did you? Bed a lot of men.

395
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,479
We have to come up with a response.

396
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,269
If we're going to sue,
we need to know...

397
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,592
It's personal.
- Not after 120,000 have read it.

398
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,437
I've had a perfectly normal
amount of boyfriends and flings.

399
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,354
At the odd Christmas party.

400
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,152
Laugesen hates this cabinet and me.
This time you took the flak.

401
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,029
Laugesen is acting under orders.

402
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,753
Who ran the story?
Three media within the last 12 hours.

403
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,471
First The Express.
And then the free newspaper CITY.

404
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,518
The Express is owned by CPH Press -

405
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,878
who in turn is owned by CITY Media
who publish the free paper.

406
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,396
"Stars and Royals"
are published by Orion House -

407
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,472
who is owned by...

408
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,552
Mermaid. Com.

409
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,359
...which is owned by Crohne Media.

410
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,796
Joachim Crohne.
It all adds up

411
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,475
Good work, Kasper.

412
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,519
Only we can't use it.
We can't prove a thing.

413
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,990
It's a great story.
- We're not going to use it.

414
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,996
We focus on the politics, and you're
shocked by these personal attacks.

415
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,675
I mean it. How are we
going to deal with the press?

416
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,188
We won't respond. We get Henriette
live on the news tonight, TV1 or TV2.

417
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,878
Let the Ministry for Economic Affairs
handle it, but run everything by me.

418
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,079
I'll set up an interview.
- I'll handle it.

419
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,596
I'm well-connected.

420
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,993
I'm very sorry
you have to go through all this.

421
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,914
I guess it's part of the job.
- No.

422
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,399
Now what?
- A gift.

423
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,677
- At what price?
- It's a gift.

424
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,152
Open it, and let's see if I want it.
- An interview with Klitgaard.

425
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:18,269
But she's refused to comment so far.
Why this sudden urge to go on TV?

426
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,675
I don't have a hidden agenda.
- Quote of the day, Kasper! Well?

427
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,038
Really? Okay.

428
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,751
Sure. Okay, Bent.

429
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,674
No, okay. Yes.

430
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,196
Am I interrupting anything?
- No.

431
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,955
Klitgaard is going on
the 6 o'clock news with Laugesen.

432
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:52,592
The network thought it would be
too tame to have her alone -

433
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,594
so Laugesen is going
to represent the Express.

434
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,596
Klitgaard cannot mention
our talks with Crohne.

435
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,637
Thanks, Sanne.

436
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,475
The Metalworkers' Union.
- That's tomorrow.

437
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,760
The Commissioner of the Faroe...
- The High Commissioner.

438
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,590
She's pretty incompetent.
- Yeah, but she's got a great ass.

439
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,675
Klitgaard can't reveal anything.
She must keep it on a personal lavel.

440
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,311
Sejrø just spoke to Danish Industry.

441
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,314
Five of our largest companies
are backing Crohne's threat.

442
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,711
If he pulls out of the country,
so will they.

443
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,431
So you're withdrawing the bill?
- They're putting the squeeze on us.

444
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,957
Don't tell Klitgaard.
Make sure she stays in line.

445
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,511
Coordinate with her adviser.
- Rune Holm is an amateur.

446
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,276
But you aren't, Kasper.

447
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,356
Rune, let's see to it
your minister doesn't screw up tonight.

448
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,114
Yes, let's.

449
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,910
How did you get so arrogant?
- Practice makes perfect.

450
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,514
Where's your adviser?

451
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:42,189
Since you insist on handling the press,
we might as well talk one on one.

452
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,992
The PM asks you to refrain
from mentioning certain issues tonight.

453
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,436
You cannot reveal
the PM's talks with Crohne.

454
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,991
You cannot use the argument
that Crohne owns the Express.

455
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,277
Don't mention Crohne.
- Please explain.

456
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,434
Laugesen has a way of making people
say things they wouldn't dream of.

457
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,189
So I stick to saying
that we're going through with the bill.

458
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,878
Don't mention the bill either.
Keep it on a personal level.

459
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:24,470
I don't get it. Is there something
you're not telling me?

460
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,916
Has Birgitte changed her mind
about the bill?

461
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,231
Just stick to our agreement.

462
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,032
You want me to go up against
an unscrupulous bastard -

463
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,320
who's peddling blatant lies
about me...

464
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,634
It goes with the job.
- Yours or mine? Have you no morals?

465
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,395
Act like a professional, dammit!

466
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,153
Now what?

467
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,550
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

468
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,797
Are you dropping the bill?
- Yes, dammit!

469
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,352
You have a meeting now.

470
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,113
You can see yourself out.

471
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,318
Say it like it is!
- How many am I up against here?

472
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,189
I love easy women -

473
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,433
- but it's not something I associate
with a minister for economic affairs.

474
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,515
Why should the public be interested
in the Minister's sex life?

475
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,753
The public has a right to know about
the morals of their politicians.

476
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,471
Your allegations are irrelevant.
- None of your men have denied them.

477
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,792
Maybe because the debate is low.
- Or because it's true.

478
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,520
Let's leave that debate for now.

479
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,753
Michael, in an interview last month -

480
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,593
- you talk about your college days.

481
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,073
"I spent all my time
doing as many women as possible. "

482
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,597
Are the rules different for men?
- You hate women in top positions.

483
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,311
I like beautiful women on top
and in all positions.

484
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,235
Does your crusade against me
as Minister of Economic Affairs -

485
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,392
serve other interests, too?

486
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,075
- Please elaborate.
- Yes, please do.

487
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,190
The corporate powers-that-be
are dead against my proposal -

488
00:42:56,360 --> 00:43:00,035
- of putting more women
on the Danish boards.

489
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,832
Your paper is owned by Crohne
Media who want the bill dropped.

490
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,278
- What an absurd allegation.
- No more absurd than your story.

491
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,991
Let him answer.
- I'm afraid our time is up.

492
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,517
The nerve of her!
She didn't let him answer.

493
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,837
What did you tell Klitgaard?
- I told her to be careful.

494
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,754
Did you tell her
we might have to drop the bill?

495
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,799
Kasper, dammit! Crohne will be
over here within the hour.

496
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,635
He'll say we're accusing him
of leaning on the cabinet.

497
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,873
He is!
- But we can't say so, Kasper!

498
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,556
The Permanent Secretary
and the Minister for Finance.

499
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,353
Have Klitgaard come in tomorrow.
- Crohne is going to sue us, dammit!

500
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,672
I'm sure he can be dissuaded.
- Sure, if we drop the bill.

501
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,159
It's our most sensible option.
- It's our only option.

502
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:22,236
No! That implies
Crohne makes good of his threat.

503
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,960
He'll be here in an hour.

504
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:34,520
How much do we know about him?
Let's hear the facts, Kasper.

505
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,878
Denmark's most powerful
businessman. A Grand Cross.

506
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,715
Founder of
the Crohne Foundation -

507
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,433
which restores Danish landmarks
and finances hospital wings and so on.

508
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,994
Thanks. Doesn't Crohne
also play bridge with the Queen?

509
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,470
You know him well, don't you?

510
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,155
He has been known to.
Every three Thursdays.

511
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,678
And he's always invited to
her New Year levées and Royal balls?

512
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,470
And what do they sing each morning
at Crohne's head office?

513
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,033
"In Denmark I was born. "
- Is this Jeopardy?

514
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,998
I'm calling...
- Crohne's bluff.

515
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,589
He's the most powerful and richest
Dane alive. Hobnobs with the Queen.

516
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,595
Huge donations to national causes.
The man is going on 70.

517
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,957
Is he going to end his days
by leaving Denmark -

518
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,875
just because he has to let
a few women on his board?

519
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,709
You're gambling.
- It's a calculated risk.

520
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,509
Let me evaluate!
- You just did.

521
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,676
You let your guests shout it out.
You're set on crucifying Laugesen.

522
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,914
That was a lousy interview.
- Sharp questions, sharp answers.

523
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,789
The anchor must distribute
the verbal blows evenly.

524
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,272
Christ, it's the Director-General
calling to kick my ass.

525
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,639
I bet Laugesen complained already.
And whose fault is that, huh, Katrine?

526
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,873
Evaluation sure comes
in all shapes and sizes.

527
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,795
I always take a critical stand
toward my guests.

528
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,315
You're ranting.
- Hey.

529
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,156
How about some interval training?

530
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,029
Let me teach you how to run.
- I've been running for 15 years.

531
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:41,670
Women's races?
- And junior handball.

532
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,437
Show me tomorrow then.
- Aren't you going running tomorrow?

533
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,832
I'll pick you up at 8 a. m.

534
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,468
See you.

535
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,117
I never said
I was going running tomorrow.

536
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,034
He's a stud!
- I bet he can't spell IQ.

537
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,350
He's mad about you.

538
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:12,311
That guy's name is Yes Please.
Repeat after me: Yes Please.

539
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,914
Well, ma'am.
Have you got an answer for me?

540
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:55,119
No.
- You need more time?

541
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,192
No, the answer is no.

542
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,356
You run this country's largest
company. We make the laws.

543
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,671
And we don't mix those two things up.

544
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,675
That's a very nonchalant attitude
considering the consequences.

545
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:19,313
The consequences of giving in to you
would be far greater for democracy.

546
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,715
It's going to pain me to leave
Denmark after a lifetime here.

547
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,558
But you won't.

548
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,112
You're not going to move 10,000 jobs
just because of three women.

549
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,670
Oh no?
What am I going to do then?

550
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,076
You're going to reveal yourself
as a modern leader -

551
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,312
adjusting to new times
ahead of everyone else -

552
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,438
because you won't
let the law force you.

553
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,072
That way you'll also get the most
competent women for your board.

554
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,671
And what do I get in return?

555
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,796
The Prime Minister's gratitude.

556
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,830
The environmental taxes are
going to hit our plants hard.

557
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,348
I'd appreciate more time
for the transition.

558
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,557
Another two years.

559
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,872
Not bad.
- Thank you.

560
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,431
But you won't make a Moderate
out of me just yet.

561
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:31,393
Your wife just beat the most
powerful man in Denmark in poker.

562
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,434
Oh. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

563
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,032
Let's celebrate.
- No. Sleep tight.

564
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,039
Good night.

565
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:04,149
Good morning.

566
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,311
Good morning.

567
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:16,790
Good morning.
- What's up?

568
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,919
Large envelope, no sender.
We got Intelligence to check it out.

569
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,232
A bomb?
- Maybe.

570
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,831
Good morning.

571
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,039
Good morning, Kasper.
- We have a problem.

572
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,829
Henriette lied on her CV.

573
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,676
We just received a transcript
of her CV from Who's Who -

574
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,277
as well as proof that she hasn't
got the degrees she claims.

575
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,991
Does it hold up?
- I'm afraid so.

576
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,271
Two universities deny
her having gone there.

577
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,113
She never got her PhD.

578
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,955
Who sent it?
- I'm betting Crohne.

579
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,112
Not personally,
but some of his people.

580
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,398
Birgitte, this is a recognition
of your settlement.

581
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,270
He's sending you the weapon
he would've used against the cabinet.

582
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,474
Does the Express have this?
- Probably.

583
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,156
But they won't use it.
Crohne won't allow it.

584
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,869
I've given her my personal support.

585
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,077
I know.

586
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,469
Come in.

587
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:03,631
Are congratulations in order?
- Yes, we'll get the bill passed.

588
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,429
I should congratulate
all women, then.

589
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,833
I'm sorry I let my temper
get the better of me on TV.

590
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,152
Yes, well,
that's not what I want to talk about.

591
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,154
Do you know the amnesty rules?

592
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,996
Anyone guilty of a crime
can avoid punishment -

593
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,754
if they turn themselves in.

594
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,949
Let's say I told you
you could confide in me -

595
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:43,116
anything you think you ought
to have told me about yourself.

596
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:50,713
You have nothing to confide, even if
it will spare you the consequences?

597
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,033
About your past?

598
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:00,952
If you're referring
to my encounter with your husband...

599
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,796
That's irrelevant.
This is the Prime Minister talking.

600
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,794
This is far more important.

601
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,158
I have no idea what you mean.

602
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,313
I'm awfully sorry -

603
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,598
because that forces me
to ask you to resign.

604
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,310
These degrees
didn't make me minister.

605
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,711
It's a long time ago.
- You lied.

606
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,953
In public, to the cabinet
and to me personally.

607
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,671
This was necessary
to get the right jobs.

608
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,958
It's a trifle.
I've been a good minister.

609
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,908
I can't have a minister who lies to me.

610
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,428
Birgitte, this isn't necessary.
Believe me, it isn't.

611
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,230
We'll find a nice way to do it.
This won't get out.

612
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,793
I suggest you send me
your resignation this afternoon.

613
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,870
Yes.

614
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:35,068
I only did what hordes of
incompetent men have always done.

615
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,834
I embellished the facts.

616
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,675
Yes, but I don't need
an incompetent man.

617
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,833
I need a competent woman.

618
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:06,318
Henriette Klitgaard is resigning
because of the smear campaign.

619
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,156
She says she's resigning
because of her family.

620
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:15,757
The media campaign
has been a shocking experience.

621
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,552
I've realized that this job
comes at a price so high -

622
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,589
- that I neither can nor will
subject my three children -

623
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:29,593
- my husband nor myself
to anymore.

624
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,869
The new Minister of Economic Affairs
is Pernille Madsen -

625
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,750
- who also gains a seat
on the Coordination Committee.

626
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,311
Hi, Mom. Have you had a nice day?
- Fine, thanks.

627
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:48,438
I'm looking forward
to continuing your work.

628
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,832
Henriette Klitgaard
was obviously moved today.

629
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,516
It's hard to say goodbye.

630
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,278
