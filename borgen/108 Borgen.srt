1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,312
All I had was my Eurocard
from the PM's Office.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,554
I know something that can make
the right person PM, if used wisely.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,950
This voucher proves
that the PM bought gifts for his wife -

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,998
for over DKK 70,000
at the government's expense.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,709
You're only home at night.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,917
And our sex life
is almost nonexistent.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,470
At least you can be with the kids.
I miss that.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,996
Take the appointment
with the school psychologist.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,277
How to stop our son
from wetting his pants.

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,433
Katrine?
- Your father's name is Peter Juul.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,832
There's no Peter Juul at Eurocopter.
- He took his new wife's name.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,833
He works for the French military.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,039
My mother committed suicide
when I was three.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,839
"History is a nightmare from which
I am trying to wake. " - James Joyce

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,639
Thank you.
That was educational.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,998
I'm sure the PM is against
the killing of pilot whales.

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,598
Aren't we wearing a tie anymore?
- It's summer vacation.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,515
Who told all the crazies
that our diary isn't full, Sanne?

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,876
There's a society against the killing
of pilot whales on the Faroes.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,110
It's cruelty to animals.

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,400
It's cultural cruelty to animals, and
it's not the government's business.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,951
Anything else?
- An Irene Juul called.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,391
She's very keen on talking to you.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,236
Sanne, you know
you're the only woman in my life.

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,072
Would you like to see the mail?
- No. Anything important?

26
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,273
Ornithologists want to turn
northern Jutland into a national park.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,556
Out.

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,598
The Danish UFO Society.
- Out.

29
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,596
Michael Laugesen has written
a book about his time in Parliament.

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,788
"A caustic and revealing description
of life in Parliament.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,589
'Exit' tells the true story
about Danish politics.

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,356
The scandals, swindles
and dirty tricks. "

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,949
I'll be back in an hour.

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,116
That was quick.
- Do you have the book?

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,073
We've given 10 copies
to the critics for their eyes only.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,118
Tell me what it says about me.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,592
I've saved your ass many times
when you had unconfirmed rumors.

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,593
I'm sorry, but I can't.

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,356
Michael is down the hall.
Talk to him yourself.

40
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,712
Hi, Michael.
- What the hell do you want?

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,599
Can I have a word?

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,877
It's important.
- Okay. I have to piss.

43
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,952
You have two minutes.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,078
Did you write about the vouchers?
- They brought Hesselboe down.

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,392
Would I write a book about Parliament
without mentioning them?

46
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,711
Did you say where you got them?
- Read the book.

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,236
I hate it when someone tells me
the ending.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,472
Aren't you going
to wash your hands?

49
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,076
It doesn't make the smell
go away anyway.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,394
And Kasper... Maybe you shouldn't
throw the want ads out these days.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,757
You can't run away from the past.

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,357
You dropped something.

53
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,475
LIST OF CRITICS

GOVERNMENT
Episode 8- The Silly Season

55
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,189
We're at
the school psychologist's.

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,835
Thank you.

57
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,556
I'm here as Magnus' mother
and not the PM.

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,315
I hope that isn't a problem.
- Not at all.

59
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,473
Phillip told me
that Magnus had a few accidents -

60
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,189
and wet his pants.

61
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,592
His teacher feels
that he is a bit out of kilter.

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,072
I imagine it has something
to do with me and my job.

63
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,872
Everyday life obviously changes
when your mother is the PM.

64
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,397
Your job causes Magnus' accidents?
- He's trying to get attention.

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,271
Magnus has also wet his pants
at school. And you're not here.

66
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,151
I'm sure it's about something much
bigger than getting your attention.

67
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,598
The quantity of time
isn't always the most important.

68
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:45,472
In stressed homes, a child often
reacts to the tone and atmosphere.

69
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,078
Has the tone changed while you
have been busier in the past year?

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,156
Yes, it's more matter-of-fact.

71
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,869
Phillip and I talk
about practicalities.

72
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,076
Practicalities?

73
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,592
We're more professional.
There are more logistics.

74
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,231
We don't always
have time to be friendly.

75
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,109
Do they also see you happy?
- What do you mean?

76
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,477
Do you think
your husband is happy?

77
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,436
Yes, I do.

78
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,915
Nothing is going on in Denmark.
- How about abroad?

79
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,277
Laugesen's memoirs?
- The book isn't out yet.

80
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,355
I know what it says.
- But it won't be out till Friday.

81
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,069
Anything else?
- How about cold buttermilk soup?

82
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,438
The production of cold buttermilk soup
is going through the roof.

83
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,718
This summer is unusually hot.

84
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,190
So sales are up by 25%.
500,000 liters a week.

85
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,831
I have an employee
who can provide a perspective.

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,436
Excellent idea.
With plenty of meat and potatoes.

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,910
Shouldn't we report news?
- It's the silly season.

88
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,278
There are seven civil wars in Africa
we never hear about.

89
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,910
And cholera in Bangladesh.
- Shut up.

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,870
Shut your damn mouth.
We have to think of our ratings.

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,272
And management loves
a nice, happy story.

92
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,228
Cold buttermilk soup is today's
hottest and happiest news.

93
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,916
You can't possibly believe that
dairy products are qualified to...

94
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,915
No, I don't want you to give me the
book, but lend it to me for an hour.

95
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,437
Easy, Kasper.
I heard about Laugesen's book.

96
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,876
I'm getting hold of copy.
- What can it say?

97
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,874
A bunch of dirt about politicians
and this administration.

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,716
Are you in contact with the other
media advisers? How about you?

99
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,872
Laugesen must remember
the voucher thing.

100
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,918
I'll get the book. No problem.

101
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,878
I hope you're right.

102
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,755
Are you okay?

103
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,708
You don't look busy.
Am I right?

104
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,509
No.
- Can I buy you dinner?

105
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,151
I don't dare go out
with the great spin doctor.

106
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,676
And your big news was...
- Cold buttermilk soup.

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,508
We might as well have
a black screen till Friday.

108
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,879
Laugesen's book will be out.
- Oh, yes. I've heard of him.

109
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,719
Who has his book?
I know one of you has a copy.

110
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,348
It's confidential.

111
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,116
I'll just mention some names,
and you can shake your head.

112
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,159
Why is it so important?
- Does Torben Friis have it?

113
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,390
I don't know.

114
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,997
It's you, you nasty thing.
You have the book.

115
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,720
Is it Ulrik?

116
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,390
Sweetie, can we talk for a minute?
- What?

117
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,837
Are you happy?
- Am I happy?

118
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,073
What kind of question is that?
- I want to know how you feel.

119
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,872
Okay. Fine. I'm slogging away.
We'll survive. I'll survive.

120
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,952
That's how I feel.

121
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,680
Do you mind...?

122
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,510
Okay.

123
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,753
If you could have anything,
what would it be?

124
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,959
A different job.
I'd like to do something different.

125
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,908
I teach 22-year-olds
about the business sector.

126
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,709
I'd love to run a company.

127
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,474
I'm often asked to.

128
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,749
The other day, a headhunter asked
if I was open to offers.

129
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,436
At that moment,
I was actually happy.

130
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,229
You would like to have a job.

131
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,437
Fine. What would it entail?

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,355
Sending the kids to boarding school.
- Someone to bring and fetch them.

133
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,829
And cook and talk to them.

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,028
We could hire an au pair.
- No, we decided we wouldn't.

135
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,278
Do you want me to quit?
- No.

136
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,069
It's a question of priorities.
We're talking about you.

137
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,155
Damn, you're good.
Do you know that?

138
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,910
Yeah.

139
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,235
Could you have your boss
call me back?

140
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,193
You're his secretary! Just tell him
Kasper Juul called three times.

141
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,079
Hello?

142
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,793
A woman in reception
wants to talk to you.

143
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,750
Can't you see I'm busy?
- I'm sorry. He's not available.

144
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,799
Okay.
She says she is your mother.

145
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,797
Didn't I tell you
that I don't want to see you?

146
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,269
Then why are you here?

147
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,194
If you want to contact me,
call me.

148
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,555
Your father is dead.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,678
Excuse me?

150
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,398
Kenneth, your father is dead.

151
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,397
I'm impressed
that you work here, Kenneth.

152
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,313
My name is Kasper now.

153
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,912
What are you plans?

154
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,834
It's just that...
- Do you mind?

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,709
What do you want?
- I need your help.

156
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,350
I don't know
who else to ask.

157
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,796
Just with the practical things
for the funeral.

158
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,953
The hospital asks
all kinds of questions.

159
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,759
I can't help you.

160
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,870
If you need help,
call the municipality.

161
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,555
But I don't know what to say.
Please come home.

162
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,871
I haven't been home
since I was 12-

163
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,669
and I have no wish
to go home now.

164
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,356
I'll contact an undertaker.

165
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,315
That sounds perfect.

166
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,155
Yes. Lovely.

167
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,436
Hi.

168
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,874
Didn't you want to show your mother
around the Prime Minister's Office?

169
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,828
It wasn't my mother.
It was our old housekeeper.

170
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,676
A rather senile old woman,
who thought I was her son.

171
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,197
Now I see why the guard said
that she called you Kenneth.

172
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,990
Actually, it's rather sad.

173
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,630
She just lost her husband.
- I see.

174
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,749
These are design proposals
for our homepage.

175
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,871
Do I need to be involved?
- Yes, it's our public image.

176
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,759
Let's take a seat.

177
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,438
When Parliament isn't in session,
the rest of us can get some work done.

178
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,071
Aren't you going on vacation?
- A long weekend in August.

179
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,435
We don't manufacture
children's shoes or ice cream here.

180
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,875
We rule Denmark -

181
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,476
and that demands total dedication.

182
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,553
Ministers always take vacation.
Hesselboe did.

183
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,553
Hesselboe pretended to.

184
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,033
A prime minister has to appear
to be a normal human being.

185
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,351
That doesn't mean
he actually goes on vacation.

186
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,039
There isn't time for any of us
to do that. Not even for me.

187
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,272
Does your wife understand?

188
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,195
My present wife does.
My two ex-wives didn't.

189
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,195
Phillip?
- Yes?

190
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,877
I put the country on automatic pilot.
We're going on vacation now!

191
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,996
Okay.

192
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,756
I think we can borrow Mads and
Malene's summer cottage in Skagen.

193
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,876
Should I call them?

194
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,511
It sounds lovely, but Intelligence
can't clear it on such short notice.

195
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,800
How about that house on Bornholm?
- Not right next to your father?

196
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,753
Doesn't the PM have access
to her own summer residence?

197
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,718
The coolest in the country.

198
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,156
Marienborg.
Your official residence.

199
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,791
It's a country mansion.
- What's wrong with that?

200
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,791
Welcome to Marienborg.
- Thank you. Magnus and Laura.

201
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,474
Hello.

202
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,918
Will the children share a room?
- No... thank you.

203
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,756
Fine.
They'll have separate bedrooms.

204
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,356
Maybe you'll sleep in the same bed
as some president.

205
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,559
Do you know all about the place?
- Not everything.

206
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,190
Would you like a guided tour later?

207
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,238
Very much.
Thank you.

208
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,949
I was thinking about dinner.
How about pizza?

209
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,476
I promised Magnus.
- Good idea.

210
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,589
Excuse me. I make dinner when
the Prime Minister is in residence.

211
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,069
We didn't know.

212
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,870
Can't we cook ourselves?
- It isn't customary.

213
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,352
Tonight it's pork tenderloin
in a creamy mushroom sauce.

214
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,354
Many ministers have enjoyed it.
Is 6 p. m. Suitable?

215
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,750
Fine, thanks.

216
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,198
Pork at 6.
Can't you ask her to take time off?

217
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,514
I don't know if I can.
- Really? I thought you were the PM.

218
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,758
THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT

219
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,594
"Everyone is anxious about
Laugesen's revealing book. "

220
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,558
Will that be a problem?
- No.

221
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,510
Kasper is getting hold of a copy,
so we can read it before it comes out.

222
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,956
What does it say?
- Who is doing whom.

223
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,078
There are always rumors.

224
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,231
Yeah.

225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,712
Who are you doing?
- Excuse me?

226
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,476
Is there anything about you?
- I don't think so.

227
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,634
No skeletons in the closet here.
- No, you're a goody-goody.

228
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,076
Only top grades
and a demure dress.

229
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,756
You're so good that you don't dare
ask the servants to take time off.

230
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,117
Are you suggesting I'm boring?
- Not at all.

231
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,714
I just have a good wife.

232
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,396
Don't believe everything
you read in the papers.

233
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,120
I'm filthy.

234
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,272
I can't fall asleep.

235
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,556
I hear strange noises.

236
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,393
Come here.

237
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,110
Don't fucking touch me!
I want to borrow it for half an hour.

238
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,431
If you don't leave now,
I'm calling security.

239
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,354
Give me that fucking book!
- Leave.

240
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,274
You're history.
- Fuck you too.

241
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,910
What the fuck is up?
- What do you mean?

242
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,629
Did you tell Kasper
that I have Laugesen's book?

243
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,677
No.

244
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,675
Why has he constantly been calling
me and now threatening me?

245
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,549
You must have got it wrong.
- Got it wrong?

246
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,511
"You'll never get an interview with
the PM." Can you get that wrong?

247
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,312
Is Kasper mentioned in the book?
- It's confidential.

248
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,516
Right.

249
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,878
Can't you see that it's a problem
that you two are going out?

250
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,919
Don't take the driving test
if you're not ready.

251
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,868
Come by on Monday,
and we'll talk, alright?

252
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,396
I'm only going to Århus
for three days.

253
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,680
Come here, Kenneth.
We'll have a really good time.

254
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,153
When Mom isn't here,
we can be noisy and watch videoes.

255
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,838
We can have a guys' night.
And we'll have Dad's food, not Mom's.

256
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,391
I'll make burgers with fries
and the whole nine yards.

257
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,551
And ice cream.

258
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,393
Coffee?

259
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,748
Would you like some coffee?
- No thanks.

260
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,754
Has the undertaker been here?
- Lovely to see you.

261
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,912
Shouldn't he be here now?

262
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,789
Your father's shirts.
Would you like to go through them?

263
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,077
Some of them are new.
- No thanks.

264
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,598
I think you're the same size.
In the end he was thin as a rake.

265
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,752
I don't want any.

266
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,479
Take your time in making
the right choices for the deceased.

267
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,270
I just want to get it over with.
- I understand.

268
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,719
But there are decisions to make
about the service, cemetery, coffin.

269
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,269
Any final wishes.

270
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,432
It will be strictly private.
- I see.

271
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,594
Will the service be held in church?
- No, he didn't belong to a church.

272
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,676
Kenneth, he did.
- We agreed that I would handle this.

273
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,395
He didn't belong to one.
- Right.

274
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,155
Burial or cremation?
- Burn him.

275
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,668
How about a plot and a headstone?
- Do tombs of the unknown still exist?

276
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,870
I would like...
- You won't look after it anyway.

277
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,511
You know best, Kenneth.
- I do. The tomb of the unknown.

278
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,513
Right.

279
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,195
That's about it then.

280
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,478
There are documents for your mother
to sign. Possibly tomorrow.

281
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,031
We can meet here when you have
them, and I'll have her sign them.

282
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,671
And as I said,
as soon as possible.

283
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,390
Dad, are we canoeing together?
- We'll beat the girls.

284
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,791
I'll go get a sweater.

285
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,315
It's Mom's.

286
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,349
It's Kasper.
We'll hide it down here.

287
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,556
Are we leaving now, Mom?
- As soon as your father is ready.

288
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,269
That's my cell phone.
Where is it?

289
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,835
Kasper?
- Hello?

290
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,719
I couldn't get hold of the book.

291
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,634
But I'm sure
Laugesen isn't holding anything back.

292
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,758
Does he have dirt on my ministers?

293
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,869
I'm sure the book reveals that
I gave Laugesen the vouchers.

294
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,635
Do you have a strategy
if it's revealed?

295
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,588
No.
- We have to meet and talk.

296
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,356
See you.

297
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,715
The worst case is that he busts you.
That could be ugly.

298
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,871
I know.

299
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,478
One option is to remain passive
and let Laugesen take the blame.

300
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,518
You showed him
the vouchers during a party.

301
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,196
But he used them
and abused my trust.

302
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,999
But it doesn't seem credible.

303
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,119
No. What's the alternative?
- Taking the offensive.

304
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,034
You gave Laugesen them deliberately.

305
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,998
How will that get me off the hook?

306
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,994
You saw the vouchers
in an undisclosed place -

307
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,756
and were so appalled that you
thought something should be done.

308
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,710
So you suggested to me
that they be made public.

309
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,475
I refused. And in frustration
you went to Laugesen.

310
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,713
Because I thought Hesselboe's
actions were reprehensible.

311
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,075
And you fired me.

312
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,995
We couldn't work together
due to a moral disagreement.

313
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:18,315
If I ever become prime minister,
will you be my spin doctor?

314
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,517
What the hell are you...?

315
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,357
Look what I found.
- What?

316
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,958
A prime minister's favorite champagne
according to the housekeeper.

317
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,511
Have you tasted it?
- I cheated, yes.

318
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,317
The housekeeper
is watching the children -

319
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,234
so they won't barge in
for the next hour and a half.

320
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,313
So I think you should kiss your wife.

321
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,515
Wait a minute.

322
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,912
I can't do it like this.
- Should I do the other thing?

323
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,356
No, I don't mean that. I...

324
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,031
I'm not in the mood.

325
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,116
Okay.

326
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,272
So...

327
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
You're never in the mood.

328
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,953
Because you're never home.
- We spend every night together.

329
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,830
You come in at 3 a. m.
With a computer under your arm.

330
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,153
Yes, but now we're on vacation.
There's peace and quiet...

331
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,151
...and we have the time.

332
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,196
I wanted to have sex
for the first time in a month.

333
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,117
And that's fantastic,
and I'm sorry.

334
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,478
I can't participate
in the official program.

335
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,516
I miss my wife.

336
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,675
Why don't you answer your phone?
- Things are busy here.

337
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:08,594
You threatened Ulrik today.
Have you lost your mind?

338
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,072
Why is that book so important?
What does it say?

339
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,560
I don't know what you mean.
- That's why you flirted with me.

340
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,670
Stop it, Katrine.
It's ourjob to get information.

341
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,958
And you tell whatever stories
you need to get what you want, but...

342
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,635
But what?

343
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,112
You still don't get it.
If you just told me the truth -

344
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,238
I would do anything for you.

345
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,838
Can I get you a beer?

346
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,349
There's one piece of information
I never got Laugesen to divulge.

347
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,789
How he got hold of the vouchers
from my wife's shopping trip.

348
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,157
When did you last see them?

349
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,872
When I gave them to Ole Dahl,
who died that very evening.

350
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,750
Two days later, Laugesen showed
them to me during a TV debate.

351
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,150
I don't know how he got them.

352
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,599
- Did Ole give them to Laugesen?
- No, Ole was very loyal.

353
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,719
No, the truth lies somewhere else.

354
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,874
We'll see if the truth is revealed
in Laugesen's book...

355
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,750
Did you do it? Did you give Laugesen
the vouchers during the election?

356
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,275
Is that what he has on you?

357
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,359
Tell me what happened
on the night that Ole died.

358
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,836
Sit down.

359
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,630
Tell me the truth
for once, Kasper.

360
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,792
It's true that I took the papers
that night and gave them to Laugesen.

361
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,633
But I didn't go through Ole's bag.

362
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,429
I did it to save you
and your career.

363
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:56,277
The bag fell over,
and the damn vouchers fell out.

364
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,431
And you took them?

365
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,232
Katrine, those papers proved
that the PM broke the law.

366
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,636
It's your duty to act
when that happens.

367
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,157
Is that how you'll explain it
to the press?

368
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,835
That you did your civic duty?

369
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,992
You stole them from a dead man.

370
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,799
Here we are. I need
your name and address here -

371
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,794
and your signature here and here.

372
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,873
As well as here.
Here's a pen.

373
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,439
Name and address here.
- Come on.

374
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,559
Name and address,
signature, signature, signature.

375
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,996
Feel free to read it first.

376
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,310
I don't know where to start.

377
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,918
We'll take them one at a time.
Let's start with your signature here.

378
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,710
Can't you fall asleep?

379
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,000
Me neither.

380
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,954
I saw your light was on,
so I know you're awake.

381
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,759
Do you miss Mom?
She's coming home on Tuesday.

382
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,276
Do you remember that game
we played last time in Dad's bed?

383
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,352
I think I can fall asleep now.

384
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,318
Let's have some fun first.

385
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,678
When we're alone, we get
to decide when we want to sleep.

386
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,628
I'm tired now, Dad.
I want to go to sleep.

387
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,870
Excuse me,
do you have a minute?

388
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,989
The crematorium called. They have
a slot at 12:30 p. m. Tomorrow.

389
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,277
A slot?
- Yes. To cremate your father.

390
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,790
Would you prefer to postpone it?
- Tomorrow is fine.

391
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,351
Do you have any opinion
on what the deceased should wear?

392
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,353
No.
- Then we'll take care of that.

393
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,557
See you tomorrow in the chapel.

394
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,950
Excuse me...

395
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,918
Hang on a minute.

396
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,472
I'd like him
to be cremated in this.

397
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,354
A pair of pajamas?

398
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,430
The Minister for Climate
is an inept womanizer.

399
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,910
Bent Sejrø is having an affair
with Yvonne Kjær.

400
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,550
And Höxenhaven
has homosexual proclivities.

401
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,636
Several politicians are threatening
to sue Laugesen for libel.

402
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,315
Of most interest is that
it was Kasper Juul-

403
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,153
- who got hold of the vouchers...

404
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,148
Why are my top ministers talking
to the press without consulting us?

405
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,633
I can't gag them.
- Did you talk to their media advisers?

406
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,432
I did talk to them. Not every spin
doctor can control their politician.

407
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,910
When will you be in Parliament?
- At noon.

408
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,277
Laura, stop making that racket!

409
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,115
You've known for days
that the book would be out today.

410
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,430
11:30 a. m.

411
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,797
- Amir, any comment?
- No comment.

412
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,476
- Are the allegations true?
- He'll hear from my lawyer.

413
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,116
These allegations are groundless.
- We're sueing for libel.

414
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,398
If you do, you'll get into
a quagmire about truth value.

415
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,994
I don't have to prove -

416
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,630
that I didn't fuck every woman
in my group.

417
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,796
But they'll ask you. And Höx
will have to discuss whether he's gay.

418
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,758
I've been happily married
for 16 years.

419
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,072
Amir and Höx can't talk to the press.
- But someone has to.

420
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,631
TV1 has asked for a comment.
- You'll give them one.

421
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,349
Your vacation has been interrupted
by a trivial matter.

422
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,034
Put a stop to it now.

423
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,318
What about the slander
about you and Yvonne Kjær?

424
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,508
I did have an affair with her.
It was a right mess. But done is done.

425
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,796
Deny it.

426
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,080
If he denies it, he lends the book
value and importance.

427
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,472
This has to be hushed up.
- But it's in all the papers.

428
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,598
They all refer to Laugesen's book.

429
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,869
If we refrain from comment,
it will look like idle gossip.

430
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,909
Our strategy is not to comment.
- But we'll demand a retraction.

431
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,269
No retraction. If we want this
to work, we'll keep our mouths shut.

432
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,318
But you have to comment, Kasper.

433
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,836
The most serious accusation
is about you.

434
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,312
And the information on Hesselboe
that Laugesen got hold of.

435
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,759
That's damn specific. That was
what overturned the government.

436
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,869
I don't understand why
we should remain silent about that.

437
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,354
How do you feel about
Laugesen's revelations?

438
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,239
Very relaxed.
- Have you read it?

439
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:02,713
No, gossip doesn't interest me.
- Then why break off your vacation?

440
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,316
I have other things to do
than feed the press.

441
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,950
How about the accusations
about your spin doctor?

442
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,557
I was aware of the voucher case
when I rehired Kasper.

443
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,793
Can Kasper Juul keep his job?
- He'll make a statement to the press.

444
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,999
That's all I can say right now.
- Birgitte Nyborg...

445
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,756
Come on now.
I'm on vacation. Thank you.

446
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,198
I'll coordinate it with the Office
and get back to you.

447
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,715
Okay. Thank you.

448
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,998
TV1 wants me on the news.
- Do it.

449
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,835
We can't hush this part up
anyway.

450
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,959
Kasper, just so we're clear...

451
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,079
A media adviser must never be
a liability to the government.

452
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,677
I can't make political sacrifices
to save you -

453
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,992
so I hope you'll do a good job.

454
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,192
Today's menu is meatloaf.
- It looks delicious.

455
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,388
And it's a suitably light dish
for summer.

456
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,150
Laura, enough with the cell phone.
Come and eat.

457
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,791
It's hot, and I'm not hungry.
- Sit down.

458
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,839
Did you play tetherball today?
- No, I fell on the pavement.

459
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,231
The crybaby bawled for 10 minutes.
- Bitch.

460
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:51,996
Mind your language.
Let's have a nice dinner.

461
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,871
Why can Mom text when I can't?
- Because she's the PM.

462
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,993
How long are we staying?
Louise is having a party on Friday.

463
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,879
Ask your mother.

464
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,429
I don't know.
We'll see.

465
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,593
Didn't we both agree
to come here?

466
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,398
Yes, yes.

467
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,475
But it depends on
whether you have time to be with us.

468
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,950
You're not really here.
- What do you mean?

469
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,198
No!

470
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,839
Okay, let's go home.

471
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,310
Fine, let's go.

472
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,950
Come on, kids. Let's pack.

473
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,315
Can I invite Ida over tomorrow?
- Fine. Answer the phone.

474
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,876
Hello? Laura speaking.
Dad, it's for you.

475
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,511
Sascha Rousing
from some headhunter thing.

476
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,275
This is Phillip. Okay.

477
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,196
That sounds pretty damn good.
Tomorrow morning is fine.

478
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,672
Bye.
They're offering me a big position.

479
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,834
Of course I'll say no,
but I have to talk to them first.

480
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,988
If you like, I have some booze
for people who are camera shy.

481
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,030
No thanks. It's not my first time.
- No problem. It was just an offer.

482
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,796
Laugesen will be in
when you're done with Juul.

483
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,032
He'd like to talk to you on the air.

484
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,911
I only agreed to do this alone.
- I thought I'd give you the offer.

485
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,437
And now you have. Twice.
The answer is still no.

486
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,875
Lean back.

487
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,631
It's my daughter. Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

488
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,316
Hi, sweetie.
No, Mom is at work.

489
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,717
We're on in 20 seconds.

490
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,270
I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last time.

491
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,716
No problem.
It's fine.

492
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,273
5 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1.

493
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,831
Kasper Juul,
the key figure in the case is here.

494
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,391
Laugesen claims that you gave him
the vouchers that toppled Hesselboe.

495
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,677
How did you get hold of them?

496
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,354
I can't comment on that.

497
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,149
I was led to believe
that you got them from Ole Dahl.

498
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:33,077
I can't reveal my sources. I'm sure
a journalist like you understands that.

499
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,152
How did Laugesen get them?

500
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,630
Birgitte Nyborg wanted
nothing to do with them -

501
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,473
but Laugesen did.

502
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,749
How can you defend approaching
the leader of another party with them?

503
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,435
I can't,
but I disagreed with her.

504
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,718
The vouchers proved that the PM
was abusing government money -

505
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,431
for private purposes.
I felt a moral obligation.

506
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,149
So you acted ethically.
If that's true -

507
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,676
I don't understand
why Nyborg fired you.

508
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:13,470
That's a widespread misconception.
I quit because of our disagreement.

509
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,156
We discussed the matter,
before we resumed our cooperation.

510
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,074
So you think you can continue
in your job?

511
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,519
It depends on whether you believe
an ethical person can be a spin doctor.

512
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,240
Thank you, Kasper Juul.

513
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,188
He isn't a spin doctor
for nothing.

514
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,391
I saw the interview.
You did well.

515
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,075
But then you're an ace
at telling stories.

516
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,312
I don't think
you understand.

517
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,871
You'd rather lie about everything
than look yourself in the eye.

518
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,192
You sound like a spoiled brat
that has never experienced -

519
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,114
how much shit there is
in the world. Goodbye, Katrine.

520
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,716
We were talking.
- So talk. I'm leaving.

521
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,351
Then leave. It's easier
than taking responsibility.

522
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,593
My father died. Okay?
- Oh, really.

523
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,231
Really died?
Or did he move to France again?

524
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,953
Hi.
- Goodness. Are you home?

525
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,750
I came home to change.
TV1 wants a comment from me -

526
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,071
about Kasper and the vouchers.

527
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,710
So you're having a beer
at 11 in the morning.

528
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,952
Are you becoming
a serious drinker?

529
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,314
I went to the headhunter meeting.
They asked -

530
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,712
if I would be the CEO of
Via Electronics in Northern Europe.

531
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,236
Wow!
That's a big deal.

532
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,951
I'm sorry.
You really deserved that.

533
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,236
I accepted it.

534
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,395
What was that?
- I took thejob.

535
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,669
But we agreed
that it would be impossible.

536
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,072
We did, but the problem was
that I wanted it.

537
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,756
I wanted the job.
Get it? I wanted it.

538
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,917
This is Kasper Juul.
Leave a message.

539
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:40,598
Hi, it's me. I wanted to talk to you
about yesterday. Give me a call.

540
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,233
The Prime Minister's Office.
- Katrine Fønsmark for Kasper Juul.

541
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,394
I'm sorry. He's not available.
He's attending a funeral.

542
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,439
He'll be in later.
Can I take a message?

543
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,353
No thank you.

544
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,556
Hello.

545
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,953
Hello?

546
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,117
The PM finds no cause
to take the matter further.

547
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,195
Kasper Juul is a trusted employee.
This case hasn't changed that.

548
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,670
- But you disagreed with him?
- True.

549
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:00,436
But Juul made an ethical call
and took the consequences.

550
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,558
And I respect that.

551
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,357
Isn't Mom coming home
at 11:30?

552
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,036
Kenneth...
You and I have to talk.

553
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,074
It's important that you and I
keep our little secret.

554
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,839
Mom won't understand.
She'd be upset and angry with you -

555
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,912
if she ever found out.

556
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:51,437
And you don't want
to upset Mom, do you?

557
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,154
Kenneth, look at me.

558
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,198
Do we have a deal?

559
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,750
Hey.
- Here comes Mom.

560
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,549
No more burgers for us now.

561
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:31,118
We have to be in the chapel soon.
Aren't you going to get dressed?

562
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,552
Mom, we have to go soon.
Get dressed so we can go.

563
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,188
I can't, Kenneth.

564
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,037
I can't.

565
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,038
Your mother?
- She's not coming.

566
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,873
