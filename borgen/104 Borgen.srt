1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,592
- Is Nyborg the right PM?
- You need a media adviser now.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,910
Hanne Holm is with the Express.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,550
Are you going to resign?
- We haven't even started yet.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,713
It's total chaos.
We're still us, aren't we?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,237
I sent you a message.
An homage to babies.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,313
I just had an abortion.
- How come we're never in sync?

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,550
Kasper?

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,917
You're good.
- Thanks.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,909
"If you hush up a ghost, it grows
bigger. " - Greenlandic proverb

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,239
See you.
- TV1 News. Simon Bech.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,630
It's for you.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,758
I'm afraid she just left.

13
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,948
He insists on speaking to you.
Says it's top priority.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,876
Katrine Fønsmark.

15
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,431
I have some information
you'll appreciate.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,230
Who is this?
- Meet me in the parking lot.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,029
Leave it at reception.
- I want to hand it over.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,830
Come out here alone.
It's a matter of national security.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,312
I'm leaving in five minutes.
It's up to you.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,870
Have you got two minutes?
- Sure.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,633
Katrine.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,674
Hello.

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,633
Hello.

24
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,150
See anything?
- Just a silver Renault.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,476
Shit.
- Was that all?

26
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,076
Yeah, I think so.
Thanks, anyway.

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,753
Stop. Don't turn around.
Stay put.

28
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,119
Step back toward the car.
Why didn't you come alone?

29
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,956
What did you expect?
- Look inside.

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,509
Who are you?
- Look inside.

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,310
It's a scoop you can't refuse.
- I need to know who you are.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,508
You can topple the government with
this. Just look inside the envelope.

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,158
What is this?
American CIA detainees?

34
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,950
These photos could be doctored.
- Well, check them.

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,352
They're all on this USB stick
in a higher resolution.

36
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,833
Look at the sign on the hangar.
- Thule Air Base.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,551
CIA detainees on Danish territory.
There's your evidence.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,679
Who are you?
- I contacted you.

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,516
Why me?
- Because you tend to be disobedient.

40
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,234
GOVERNMENT
Episode 4- 100 Days

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,269
A WEEK LATER

42
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,953
My source contacts me
and not vice versa.

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,478
He demands anonymity, but he works
for the Defence Intelligence Service.

44
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,033
Are you 100 percent sure?
- I saw his ID card.

45
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,555
Can we mention his name?
- No.

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,996
We'll call him a source
close to the military.

47
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,709
What's his motive?
- He says he loves Denmark.

48
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,396
Don't we all?
- There's more to it than that.

49
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,709
Our photo guys have okayed
the photos.

50
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,317
Semi-professional equipment.
High resolution. No Photoshop signs.

51
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,994
When are we going to run it?

52
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,393
Do you trust your source?
- Completely.

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,831
We're all on the line here.
- Do you realize the potential of this?

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,436
Didn't you get the Cavling Prize once?

55
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,833
I have other responsibilities now.
- You know we're good to go.

56
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,391
Calm down. We're going to run it.
What the hell did you expect?

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,596
Go ahead, Katrine.

58
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,039
The US is using Thule Air Base
as a transit base for CIA detainees.

59
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,953
Welcome to the TV1 News.

60
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,195
Where did TV1 get those pictures?
- They won't reveal their source.

61
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,354
The military must have some idea.
- They're looking into it.

62
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,389
Let's talk about your first 100 days.
You've had 100 days in office.

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,633
Good morning.
- The press loves that kind of stuff.

64
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,157
We need a positive
to heighten your profile as the PM.

65
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,111
Sure, but I want it to be
a concrete political result.

66
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,239
Just you wait.
- Sanne, clear my morning schedule.

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,919
You're going to the hairdresser's.
- No, clear my morning schedule.

68
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,594
Thank you.

69
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,112
I'll get rid of her,
but the union will put up a fight.

70
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,513
The Security Council
is waiting -

71
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,276
with the Ministers for Justice and
Defence and their department heads.

72
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,718
Who do they think the leak is?
- They don't know.

73
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,079
The Greenland Premier is on
his way down to get a statement.

74
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,959
We owe him an apology.

75
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,159
We're historically disinclined
to offer Greenland apologies.

76
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,711
It implies responsibility
and entails unforeseen expenses.

77
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,759
Have a plan of action ready by noon.

78
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,516
I'm not taking the fall just because
Hesselboe was Bush's little lapdog.

79
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,355
Good morning, gentlemen.
Don't get up.

80
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,999
Are we allowing the Americans
to land CIA detainees in Greenland?

81
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,638
Look, don't you play
cloaks and daggers with me.

82
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,157
Do these flights take place?
- We don't know for sure.

83
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,155
Our agreement with the US forbids us
to check their planes at the base.

84
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,872
Isn't that agreement from the
Bush era? It can't still be in effect.

85
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,716
CIA is a state in the state.
It's hard to disempower them.

86
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:32,069
What has Washington got to say?
- The Ambassador is coming in later.

87
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,430
Good. Make it clear to him that their
long-time ally expects an explanation.

88
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,754
I see no reason to jeopardize our
otherwise good relations to the US.

89
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,469
What about our otherwise
good relations to Greenland?

90
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,519
Greenland is not our primary
concern right now.

91
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,754
I am the minister responsible
to Greenland, and I am concerned -

92
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,436
about the way the press uses this
to expose our policies as a sham.

93
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,071
We give them home rule,
yet we still rule supreme.

94
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,359
Who is going to buy us time
with the press, until we know more?

95
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,476
Keep me out of it.

96
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,668
I say the Minister for Defence.
The leak did come from his ministry.

97
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,789
Thule Air Base employs a lot
of people. Who says it's one of ours?

98
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,748
The military doesn't fear the press,
Troels.

99
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,471
I never said so, Troels.
- Hans Christian, go on TV tonight.

100
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,998
We doubt the authenticity
of the pictures and will bide our time.

101
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,836
No, we're checking their authenticity
and take the matter very seriously.

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,036
Okay.
- Good.

103
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,036
The News calls the detainees illegal.

104
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,389
But no one's been able to document
that the detainees are in fact illegal.

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,870
Maybe you can use that.

106
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,311
Yes, Mom.

107
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,319
Minister for Defence, good evening.

108
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,951
How could these renditions take place
on Danish territory?

109
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,114
Denmark and the US have enjoyed
close relations for many years.

110
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:31,197
Why on earth should the US wish
to violate Danish territorial laws?

111
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,396
Give him hell, Ulrik!

112
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,429
The orange suits invariably make you
think of the Guantánamo detainees.

113
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:46,632
Guantánamo is being closed.
I see men in orange jumpsuits.

114
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,397
The same jumpsuits are worn
by thousands of American criminals.

115
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,315
What makes these detainees illegal?
Answer me that.

116
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,950
You're not going to pursue the matter?

117
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,033
We're looking into it
and take the matter very seriously.

118
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,158
But that's all I can say for now.

119
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,509
You're not letting him off the hook!
- Next, the declining real estate...

120
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,549
Why didn't you pressure him?
- What is Katrine doing in my ear?

121
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,794
You could've asked him what
the detainees are doing in Greenland.

122
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,114
When a minister cuts you off
all shifty-eyed, he's lying!

123
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,159
Could this wait till after the show?

124
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,916
Ulrik, that was a lousy interview.

125
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,799
And you're on, Ulrik.

126
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,038
Congratulations. Thorsen managed
to put a lid on the issue on the News.

127
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,228
It's not over yet. The Foreign Policy
Committee wants an explanation.

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,313
You want me to go?
- It won't be hard.

129
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,519
Doubts have been raised as
to whether the detainees are illegal.

130
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,468
And you just spoke to the Americans.

131
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,030
What explanation did they offer?
- The Ambassador didn't say much.

132
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,675
A simple yes or no will do. Does the
CIA carry out renditions in Greenland?

133
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,879
"It's on a need-to-know basis.
And you don't need to know. "

134
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,830
You let him put you off with that?
- They guard their foreign policy well.

135
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,438
But as the Minister for Foreign Affairs
you represent the wronged party.

136
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,310
What about the Committee?
- I'll handle it myself.

137
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,919
You came home to comfort
the lonely housewife?

138
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,313
I've been around wimps all day.
Thank God I'm not married to one.

139
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,915
Pantyhose is impossible.

140
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,629
Why is the door locked?
- We're rearranging the furniture.

141
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,872
Can I have some chips then?
- Sure.

142
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,951
You're a gorgeous man.
Drop dead gorgeous.

143
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,154
We haven't had sex in three weeks
because I've been beat.

144
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:07,829
How about if we have regular days
just to make sure we get it done?

145
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,878
Why not have sex when we want to?

146
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,072
Sure, but we could have regular days,
too. Tuesdays and Saturdays?

147
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,314
Tuesdays, I'm done with the minister
meeting, and Saturday is my day off.

148
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,238
This conversation is far out.
Scheduled sex with the PM.

149
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,236
You didn't exactly pound
on the Minister for Defence today.

150
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,994
It was a crappy interview.

151
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,790
You can topple the government.
- It happened under Hesselboe.

152
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,032
The civil servants
have known all along.

153
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,670
You can't get civil servants to talk.

154
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,513
I'm talking.
- No, you're whispering.

155
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,990
You're an anonymous source.
I need more.

156
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,118
I've got something for you.

157
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,154
Come on.

158
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,435
Transcripts from the tower at Thule.
Landings and takeoffs.

159
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,037
The highlighted one
is the plane on the pictures.

160
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,995
It took place.

161
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,597
And here... Two missing men,
issued by the Human Rights Watch.

162
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,797
Afghan peasants
abducted by the Americans.

163
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,873
The guy in the red hat
is on the picture from Thule.

164
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,431
That proves they're illegal detainees.

165
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,716
Why are you doing this, Carsten?
- Honor.

166
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,355
Elaborate on that.

167
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,229
I've been with the military
for 25 years.

168
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,709
When I see the flag, I see something
I'm willing to die for.

169
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,714
As a young man
I served on the Sirius Patrol.

170
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,997
I've traveled 9,000 miles
on dog sled in Greenland -

171
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,153
through a darkness
you wouldn't believe.

172
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,757
That sort of thing makes an impact.

173
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,993
These past ten years we've lost
every degree of sovereignty -

174
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,632
in relation to the US. We've turned
into their eager little brother.

175
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,396
We take part in their wars without
demanding a legitimate reason.

176
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,872
We help them detain
innocent people.

177
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,510
We let them use our territory
as they please.

178
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,232
How long has this been going on?
- A long time. Since 9/11.

179
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,234
Before that, they brought
nuclear weapons up there.

180
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,757
When one of their planes crashed,
spilling nuclear weapons on the ice -

181
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,233
we helped them clean up their mess.
There's still a bomb lying up there.

182
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,475
At some point it's got to stop.
It's been going on far too long.

183
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,916
I'm prepared
to go all the way with this.

184
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,710
I know the risk you're taking.
I'll get your story out.

185
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,908
Can I have your number?
- No way.

186
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,676
I need to be able to contact you,
or else I won't get any further.

187
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,915
Use a word you don't usually end
your newscast with. Snow.

188
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,478
Hello.
- Yes!

189
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,837
Good morning.

190
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,788
Katrine Fønsmark?
Police.

191
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,159
How did you get in contact with
the man who gave you the pictures?

192
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,711
Did you contact him?
- I'm not naming my source.

193
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,079
You'd better.
- Can I get your names? Some ID?

194
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,075
Two police officers are trying
to force me to name my source.

195
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,518
What are your names?
Let me see some ID!

196
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,831
Let me talk to Pia.

197
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,439
So, are we agreed on Greenland?
The Premier is waiting.

198
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,832
He's here?
He's waiting outside?

199
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,393
He's used to it. They're finding it
hard to administrate their home rule.

200
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,634
They need us. We just gave them
the right to their own underground.

201
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,032
What if they find oil?
They cannot have it both ways.

202
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,671
I'd give him 15 minutes, max.
- I'll give him a cup of coffee.

203
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,231
No money, no apology, but we regret
the incident at Thule Air Base.

204
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,192
Though we don't know what happened
exactly. If anything at all.

205
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,638
Niels Erik, you've been
Permanent Secretary for eight years.

206
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,715
You're on the Security Council.
Tell me about these flights.

207
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,829
I don't recall having been present at
meetings where they were mentioned.

208
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,676
Please.
- Birgitte Nyborg.

209
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,879
Jens Enok.
- Welcome to Denmark.

210
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,391
The old place hasn't changed...

211
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,714
...apart from the artwork.

212
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,671
A change of system entails new art.
- Hopefully more than that. Sit down.

213
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,552
Thank you for coming down.

214
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,431
We don't quite know what
has been going on at Thule Air Base -

215
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,831
but we're working on...

216
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,197
It's okay.
You don't need to explain yourself.

217
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,636
We've done our duty by meeting.

218
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,234
You can't apologize.

219
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,393
You didn't violate
Greenland's territory.

220
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,791
We're locked in our old positions.

221
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,509
Greenland is no match for Denmark -

222
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,116
just as Denmark is no match
for the US.

223
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,592
Kalaallit Nunaat.
That's Greenland in Greenlandic.

224
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,911
It means
'the land of the Greenlanders'.

225
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,437
But that's wishful thinking
more than reality.

226
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,751
I regret that.

227
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,196
How about that coffee then?
- Sure.

228
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,956
Torben, you'll call them back.
Tell them you'll call them back.

229
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,588
I'll call you back.

230
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,231
Intelligence almost broke in earlier,
demanding to know my source.

231
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,555
Sure they were intelligence officers?
- The police didn't send anyone.

232
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,033
This shows we're on to something.
- It's the Director General's call now.

233
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,637
I need to make sure
it'll stand up in court.

234
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,992
Look at this.
I met my source last night.

235
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:29,998
The flights are real, and the detainees
are illegal. There's the proof.

236
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,392
My air force expert okays
the landing transcripts.

237
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,918
I want to interview Hanne Holm
tonight. She's an expert on Thule.

238
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,871
She says this is a clear continuation
of our patronizing foreign policy.

239
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,276
Torben, are you bailing on me?

240
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,516
My source is putting his life
on the line for us.

241
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,116
This is a matter
of national importance.

242
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,956
Isn't this why we became reporters?
- Shut the fuck up.

243
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,558
It's fucking good. We'll break it on
the radio and go all out on TV tonight.

244
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,630
Got a light?
- Sorry.

245
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,831
Kasper Juul.
- Is the PM available tonight?

246
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,039
I'm available for anything tonight.

247
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,749
We want Nyborg to comment
on the case on the 8:30 news.

248
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,550
The Foreign Policy Committee meeting
didn't add anything to the case.

249
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,474
Listen to the Radio News
in two minutes.

250
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,155
- Can we have the PM first?
- Have we got a date?

251
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,791
I'm not naming my source.
- Would I ask you to?

252
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,750
Okay, then. Deal.
- Deal. Bye.

253
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,711
Svend Åge.
Got a light?

254
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,228
I hear the PM's having coffee
with miffed Eskimos.

255
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,109
I think they prefer
to be called Inuits.

256
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,353
I know the wee Mrs. Nyborg
loves indigenous people -

257
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,275
but just how indigenous
can you be, I ask you?

258
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,399
What do you mean?
- They can't govern themselves.

259
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,994
Their young are uneducated.

260
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,392
Their corporate sector is based
on a mix of corruption and Stalinism.

261
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,553
They drink like crazy
and abuse their children sexually.

262
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,670
How's that related to CIA's flights?
- Your cabinet needs Solidarity.

263
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,868
Don't let the Foreign Policy
Committee's left-wing members -

264
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,079
bully you into giving Greenland
concessions.

265
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,190
The Freedom Party will support you.
- Can I tell that to the PM?

266
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,593
Sure. The Reds are eager to give the
Eskimos all the home rule in the world.

267
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:30,312
If you want home rule,
you must be able to rule yourself.

268
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,591
An intelligence source reveals
to TV1-

269
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,278
- that the CIA detainees on the
flights to Thule were indeed illegal.

270
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,911
Several detainees are allegedly
innocent Afghans -

271
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,516
- who went missing a long time ago.

272
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,391
The Foreign Policy Committee
convenes in an hour and a half.

273
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,075
They'll want to know
where the press gets their info.

274
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,756
The leak must be an officer.
The military is like a sieve.

275
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,118
Cut it out.
- It was the US ambassador.

276
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,159
They're afraid
we may feel pressured -

277
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,836
into giving Greenland a say
in future military agreements up there.

278
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,039
The Social Solidarity Party's
barking up that tree, too.

279
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,636
The Freedom Party promises us
their support -

280
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,588
if we refrain from giving
Greenland any concessions.

281
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,038
What if the source keeps leaking?
Where will it end?

282
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,514
It ends here. The police are
on their way out to charge TV1.

283
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,639
They're guilty
of receiving confidential information -

284
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,828
because it was stolen from
the military and distributed by TV1.

285
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,549
But you can't.
- It's the law.

286
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,431
But arresting reporters is lousy PR!
- Worried about your little girlfriend?

287
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,116
Cut it out!
What are we doing?

288
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,796
Collaborating with the Freedom Party
to oppress the Greenlanders?

289
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,032
Arresting reporters?

290
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,038
Just 100 days in, and we sound
like the previous cabinet.

291
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,274
That's realpolitik for you.
- Not this cabinet's realpolitik.

292
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,228
We get the PM,
if she makes a statement.

293
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,076
For our backdrop I want a close-up
of the detainees at the base.

294
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,268
And I want you to hold
the actual landing transcripts.

295
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,592
Everyone can relate to them.

296
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,320
Good evening. Police.

297
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,076
TV1 is under suspicion for
distributing stolen information -

298
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,394
and those responsible will be
charged according to section 152D.

299
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,908
Torben Friis, Pia Munk,
Ulrik Mørch and Katrine Fønsmark.

300
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,789
This prohibits any further publication
of said information.

301
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,589
The Director General
has been informed.

302
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,471
Fucking hell.

303
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,073
What a joke!

304
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,994
This is a historic moment.
- Excuse me.

305
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,438
Can I talk to you?
- The PM's got the committee in 15.

306
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,596
Exactly, and I just talked
to the Ministry for Defence.

307
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,151
There's something you should
know about the flight to Thule.

308
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:55,635
SL means Security Landing. That is,
they landed for security reasons.

309
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,789
A forced landing?
- Exactly.

310
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,590
A technical problem forced
the plane to land at Thule.

311
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,190
That changes everything.

312
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,677
Let's ask her how she feels
about freedom of speech.

313
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,549
How can they even begin to think
this will stop us?

314
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,793
We need to talk strategy.
- I just spoke to the Director General.

315
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,069
While we're being investigated,
we're not publishing the transcripts.

316
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,670
What?
- That means they'll win.

317
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,233
Nor can we show the pictures.
- Katrine can refer to them.

318
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,313
I can't interview Hanne Holm
about a picture I can't show.

319
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,711
And that's why
she's not coming tonight.

320
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,237
You're putting a lid on it.
- No. The PM is still coming.

321
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,597
She'll get a chance to defend herself.

322
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,788
Ulrik, for fuck's sake.
- I guess Torben's right.

323
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,196
I can't work this way.
- You're a pro.

324
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,115
The only one, it seems!
- This is an order.

325
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,840
End of story!

326
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,832
Crap!

327
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,154
I'm sorry we called you in.
Torben won't let you go on.

328
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,598
I can't use the transcripts,
nor the pictures from Thule.

329
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,710
He's putting a lid on it?
- By order from above.

330
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,872
Katrine, can I talk to you?

331
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,717
Gee, Friis. I didn't know
your model came without balls.

332
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,157
Yesterday, TV1 brought pictures
of illegal detainees landing at Thule.

333
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,269
We have reason to believe they're
genuine. How do you feel about this?

334
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:13,195
The flight did take place.
- You confirm this?

335
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,033
Yes.
We've looked into the matter -

336
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,228
and it turns out
it was a forced landing.

337
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:27,236
When a plane is in distress,
you don't ask what it's carrying.

338
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,710
This is evident
from the landing transcripts.

339
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,395
We're under police orders
not to use those transcripts.

340
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,518
I can't comment on that -

341
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,629
but this cabinet is not out
to curtail freedom of speech.

342
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,078
The plane made a forced landing?
Have there been other flights?

343
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,630
Not to my knowledge.
- Time's up, Katrine.

344
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,917
To my knowledge
there haven't been any more.

345
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,436
But you can't guarantee...
- Cut, Katrine!

346
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,593
I'm afraid our time's up.
Thank you for coming.

347
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,751
Perhaps it was naive of me to think I
wouldn't lie during my first 100 days.

348
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,357
You didn't lie. To your knowledge
there haven't been any more flights.

349
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,310
The States have considered Greenland
their little playground since WW2.

350
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,837
You shut the case down and offered
the press a fine explanation.

351
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,596
You ought to be happy.
- I just hope I can sleep at night.

352
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,391
Why don't I go to Greenland
and offer them an explanation?

353
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:43,795
A gesture. We need a positive
after 100 days. You said so.

354
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,069
I had hoped for something
a little sexier than Greenland.

355
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,153
Just make the arrangements.

356
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,271
Call that an interview?
Why didn't you use my material?

357
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,113
My boss put a lid on it.

358
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,398
I've put my life on the line.
You promised to go all the way.

359
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,358
We're up against the police.

360
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,275
And my wimp of a boss won't let me
use the material you gave me.

361
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,989
Why didn't you tell me
it was a forced landing?

362
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,756
It's just one of several landings.
- So the PM lied on TV?

363
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,550
Whenever the Americans land there
with captives, it's a 'forced landing'.

364
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,274
Do you realize who we're up against?
I never should have come to you.

365
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,076
I'll get back to you. Bye.

366
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,358
We'd better not.
- What's up?

367
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,193
I can't tell you.

368
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,838
Who was that on the phone?
- I can't tell you.

369
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,710
See what I mean?
- Let's just keep it personal then.

370
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:23,271
Maybe you need to talk
about the child you just lost.

371
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,957
Are you mad?
- Every woman's favorite question!

372
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,511
You lost the first round, okay?
- We lost? How about democracy?

373
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,717
Calm down.

374
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,351
Ask me a question,
and I'll give you an honest answer.

375
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,399
Did you know
I was going to be charged?

376
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,915
Did you?

377
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,475
Yes, maybe.
- This isn't working.

378
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,149
Why didn't you warn me?

379
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,029
Your minister got me charged.
- Höxenhaven isn't my minister.

380
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,354
Did you tell me about the transcripts,
or did I hear about them on the news?

381
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,197
And what if I had called?
- Then you'd have been loyal to me.

382
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,151
Strange.

383
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,837
Someone's been here.

384
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,150
Someone's been here, for fuck's sake!

385
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,990
He got away.
- They hacked into my computer.

386
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,516
A reporter's computer!
He was right.

387
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:12,276
Was that why you wanted to meet me
at the café? Are you in on this?

388
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,558
Do you know
what you're accusing me of?

389
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,871
Just a moment.

390
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,432
Who is it?
- The boozer you got fired.

391
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,150
I think Intelligence
broke in yesterday.

392
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,154
Sounds plausible considering
the game you're playing at.

393
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,475
I called in my friends.

394
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,668
If the police persist, they have
to charge 40 to 50 reporters.

395
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,799
In other words,
they'll have to drop the case.

396
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,234
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
UNDER PRESSURE

397
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:31,999
I don't know what to say.
- A 'thank you' would be nice.

398
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,598
Now your wimp of a boss can't
prevent you from covering the case.

399
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,039
So get to work.
- I need to find a new angle.

400
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,797
Put your source on TV. Live.
- No. He still works for the Service.

401
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,997
Not for long. They'll find him.

402
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,790
Tell him that unless he comes forward,
all this has been in vain.

403
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,318
Do you know why he's doing it?
- He wants us to stand up to the US.

404
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,712
He's willing to die for the flag.
- God, men are primitive.

405
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,795
Just get him to make a statement first.
Have you any way of contacting him?

406
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,477
Maybe.

407
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,715
That's all for now. I'm glad we got
through it all before the snow came.

408
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,878
"Before the snow came. "
Is that our new exit line?

409
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,158
I was lost for words.
- Will someone please get this glass?

410
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,948
Did you see all the headlines?
Nice with all this collegial support.

411
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,478
And what a triumph for democracy.
- I thought you put a lid on the case.

412
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,838
When you learn to shut up, you'll have
a glorious future ahead of you.

413
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,915
Is that our main story today?
- We can't squeeze more out of it.

414
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:02,519
It's still a great story.
- It's already been told, okay?

415
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,753
Anything else?
- The PM is going to Greenland.

416
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,517
Great. Let's get some pictures
of the plane taking off.

417
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,992
I bet it's all spin and no bark.
- The cabinet feels guilty, obviously.

418
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,871
Or maybe Nyborg stands
for a new kind of leadership.

419
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,068
Our only piece of evidence
is that one forced landing.

420
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,994
Did your source give you any more?
Did he?

421
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,119
No.
- So much for Deep Throat.

422
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,513
Let's not forget the story
about the charges brought against us.

423
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,878
And let's try and get
that eloquent Eskimo -

424
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,716
to say a few words
about the menu Nyborg is in for.

425
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,589
Just pile it on thick.

426
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,638
Torben?
- Yes.

427
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,997
There's someone I want you to meet.

428
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,110
Carsten Ockels.
Defence Intelligence Service.

429
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,789
That forced landing wasn't
the only CIA flight to Greenland.

430
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,397
I'm prepared to come forward
and tell the whole story.

431
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,237
Have a nice flight, ma'am.
- Thank you, Simon.

432
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,869
Some Greenland statistics.

433
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,160
The most recent financial scandals.
The suicide rate is on the rise.

434
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,599
Alcoholism and all that.
- For my information.

435
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,959
They say it's so beautiful up there
you tend to lose your bearings.

436
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,636
Intelligence is on to the
whistleblower, so he's out of our hair.

437
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,191
What's that supposed to mean?
- Have a nice trip to Greenland.

438
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,555
You called, babe?
- Are you staying the night there?

439
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,553
I don't know. Why?

440
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,271
Well, it's Tuesday,
and I get to ball the PM on Tuesdays.

441
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,228
Have a nice trip, baby.

442
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,236
Kasper will be here in two minutes.
It's going to be a hectic trip.

443
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,915
You have an hour and a half
with the Premier.

444
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,915
Then an hour with Parliament,
a brief press conference -

445
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,709
and finally the official handshake.

446
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,668
Do we have to stay the night?
- No, we're flying back tonight.

447
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,277
Greenland is behind us...
regarding time, I mean.

448
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,353
Sorry I'm late.
- Let's go.

449
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,152
About the official photo.
A medium anorak and size 7 kamiks?

450
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,073
I always forget my kamik size.

451
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,117
Get my coat, will you?
- Sure.

452
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,559
Why is Sanne coming?
- She won the draw.

453
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,236
A clerical employee
always gets to go.

454
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,079
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs got
this from the American ambassador.

455
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,837
The American President is gracing us
with a brief visit this summer.

456
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,312
Great, huh?
- In return for the Thule cover-up?

457
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,554
Spare me the self-righteous act.
Greenland gets a visit from the PM.

458
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,631
Great for them.
We put in a token appearance.

459
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,997
And then it's time to plan
the American visit.

460
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,756
After your 100 days, the leader
of the free world comes knocking.

461
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,472
The PM has arrived in Nuuk where
she's meeting with the Premier -

462
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,350
- to discuss the matter
of the controversial Thule pictures.

463
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,752
Your official kamiks are a size 8.

464
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,837
You're due at their Parliament at 2.

465
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,833
Welcome.
- Thanks.

466
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:35,154
I'm very glad to be here, and I hope
we can end this matter now.

467
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,231
What?

468
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,633
This 'matter' started 300 years ago
when Hans Egede colonized us.

469
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,872
And you expect to end it in an hour?

470
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,033
I was referring to the matter
of the American CIA plane at Thule.

471
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,158
Oh, that.
That only began 60 years ago -

472
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,632
when Denmark had an entire town
displaced in order to build the base.

473
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,952
I can put on a happy face
when I visit you.

474
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,874
But I tell it like it is
when you visit me.

475
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,909
What about your own responsibility?
- Did we ask to be colonized?

476
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,073
No, but it's hard for us
to give you increased home rule -

477
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,554
when nepotism, trade blunders
and corruption abound here.

478
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,473
Over 40% don't finish high school -

479
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,031
because your schools are too poor.
And we don't run your schools.

480
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,478
We're trying to fix that.
- Are you?

481
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,078
One could think you're just waiting
for the ice to melt and reveal the oil.

482
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,437
What if there isn't any oil?

483
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,437
Who do you think you are?

484
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:09,475
If you'd given me 24 hours, I could've
showed you what this is all about.

485
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,838
Show me what?
- You could meet the Greenlanders.

486
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,549
But you're not interested.

487
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,390
Kasper and Sanne,
come here, will you?

488
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,028
Re-schedule the press conference.
We're staying till tomorrow afternoon.

489
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,919
Thank you.

490
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,473
Carsten Ockels isn't here,
so we can't run the interview.

491
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,871
No, damn it.
- Yes, damn it.

492
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,476
Did you deliver? No.

493
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,111
That story is closed.
Run the early retirement story instead.

494
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,558
We can still say they always call
these flights forced landings.

495
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,430
Look, your source isn't here.
- I'll get him to come in tomorrow.

496
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,756
Katrine speaking.
Carsten, I thought we had a deal!

497
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,153
The Service is going to nail me
for breach of confidentiality.

498
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:13,395
You were aware of the risk.
- There's some stuff in my past.

499
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:17,758
I was heartbroken
after my wife's death.

500
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,596
I took a lot of pills.
I neglected my duties.

501
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,399
People will understand.

502
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:31,351
While I was with the Sirius Patrol,
I was charged with rape.

503
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,195
The charges were dropped, but...
- You were guilty?

504
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,355
Today I received an envelope
with everything.

505
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,796
Copies of prescriptions -

506
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:52,035
old psychologist's statements,
reports on a DUl charge, the rape.

507
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,830
They're going to depict me
as a sick, untrustwon'thy person.

508
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,235
They left me a message. They know
my daughter's got a new teaching job.

509
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,632
No school wants to hire
a rapist's daughter.

510
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,588
Those were their very words!
- They want to scare you off.

511
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,356
I'm coming over.
- They're going to dishonor me.

512
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,798
We can still do it.
Let me interview you tomorrow...

513
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,397
You're losing a story.
That's all.

514
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:31,351
Carsten, the girl that was raped -

515
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,909
was she a Greenlander?

516
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,669
Did Ockels call?

517
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,071
He hung up on me last night.

518
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,392
Sit down.
I need to talk to you.

519
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,395
Look...

520
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,314
I just got a call from an old friend
in the police.

521
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,075
Carsten Ockels was found dead
this morning.

522
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,153
Probably pills, but the official
cause of death is a heart attack.

523
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,791
Intelligence has put a lid on it.

524
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,634
They killed him, the bastards.

525
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:36,430
Well, we can't say that on TV.

526
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,272
But it's still a good story.
And it's yours.

527
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,076
Tell that story if you want to.

528
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,391
About your meeting,
and what he told you.

529
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,791
I'm behind you all the way.

530
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,231
Intelligence is still going
to defame him.

531
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,790
And that's going to hurt his family.

532
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,670
Dead or alive,
they're still going to...

533
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,313
...dishonor him.

534
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,472
The choice is yours.

535
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,075
He only lived to be 19.

536
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,394
Our biggest problem is that
we're going to die out as a people.

537
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,873
The birth rate is dropping.
Our young people leave Greenland.

538
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,591
But the worst thing is
the skyrocketing suicide rate.

539
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,799
All the young men
are killing themselves.

540
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,712
Like him.

541
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,351
What have you done about it?
- We've tried almost everything.

542
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,799
Suicide hotlines,
psychologists, anti-depressants.

543
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,349
But it's just getting worse.

544
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,752
20% of Greenlandic youths
have tried to commit suicide.

545
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,912
It's a tragic world record.

546
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,878
Why is this, do you think?

547
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:20,079
Suicide has always been
part of our culture.

548
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,391
People threw themselves
off a mountain -

549
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,950
which was called
'the place where you fall down'.

550
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,150
But they were old people who had
become a burden to their families.

551
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,518
Back then suicide was an act of pride.

552
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,879
Maybe our young commit suicide
because they take pride in nothing.

553
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,989
Why do Greenlanders drink?
Why are our children abused?

554
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,039
People have forgotten who they are.

555
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,795
I have a plan for my country.
If I'm to succeed -

556
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,191
we must give our people back
their self-respect.

557
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,639
I want the suicide rate to drop.
- But how?

558
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,272
Let Greenlanders have a say
in the major issues.

559
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,876
Political security matters
and foreign affairs?

560
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,953
But that you can't give us, can you?

561
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,594
Kasper,
we have to talk to the Americans.

562
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,317
Things have got to change.
- Don't rock the boat.

563
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,711
The President's visit is
in all the papers.

564
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,319
Set up a meeting with the Ministers
for Foreign Affairs and Defence.

565
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,918
Damn, I forgot presents for the kids.

566
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,312
I bought some stuff for them.

567
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,995
Why ruin a good thing?

568
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,711
You sell our policies.
I make them. Get it?

569
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,354
Hi.

570
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,912
Are they asleep?
- Yes.

571
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,839
Mom!
- Hi, sweetie.

572
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,753
What a welcome.
- Did you get us anything?

573
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,275
Indeed I did.

574
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,433
A genuine polar bear tooth.
Huge, huh?

575
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,070
A Tupilak! I'm bringing it
to school tomorrow.

576
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,119
It hope it contains a soul.
- I'm sure it does.

577
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,909
Off to bed.
- Good night.

578
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,709
Sleep tight, kids.
See you tomorrow.

579
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,557
What's that?
- My little black book.

580
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,950
I'm keeping score.

581
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:27,150
Saturday you were beat.
Tuesday you were in Greenland.

582
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,996
That makes two.
So we have to borrow.

583
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:39,271
It all adds up to: You have to spend
the next 14 days on your back.

584
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,875
Call it a work injury.

585
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,589
How was Greenland?

586
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,237
It was magnificent.

587
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,552
It was depressing.

588
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,557
Ugly.

589
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,679
I think it's the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

590
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,879
All rolled into one.

591
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:19,957
I'm not sure we did Greenland
a favor by discovering it.

592
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,230
Oh, it's pretty.

593
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,833
It's baby seal.

594
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,310
You couldn't find something
a little less PC?

595
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,508
Sure. There are a pair
of musk thongs, too.

596
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,877
"Major Ockels was
a treasured employee -

597
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:01,999
and the Minister for Defence
appreciates his loyal service. "

00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:07,553
Was it right of me to shut the case?

599
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,793
You spared him the humiliation
of being smeared by the press.

600
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,556
So yes, you did.
- But he died in vain.

601
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,316
His information didn't lead

602
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,278
I think it did.

603
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,560
Negotiations over the expansion
of the US radar at Thule have begun.

00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,510
For the first time, they take place
in Greenland led by the Premier.

605

The negotiations are expected
to end in two weeks -

606
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,639
- but may protract, now that
the Greenlanders have a say, too.

607
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,715
The American President
has cancelled the state visit -

608
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,271
- allegedly due to
a busy schedule in Washington.
