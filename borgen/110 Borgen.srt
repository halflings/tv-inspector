1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,997
Everyone knows I had an affair
with Yvonne a while back. It's over.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,596
You can't just take off for days.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,072
I got scared and thought
you were with another woman.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,118
I was.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,272
Yesterday, a press release stated -

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,399
that your husband is resigning.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,712
My husband cannot benefit
financially from my policies -

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,110
- as long as he's married to me.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,589
Clear your desk!

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,230
Take some time to consider,
if you want to be part of this team!

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,872
Why won't you talk to me?
- Because we don't talk, Birgitte.

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,316
We used to, but not anymore.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,595
"A prince never lacks legitimate
reason to break his promise. "

14
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,470
The PM is under a lot of pressure
when she opens parliament.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,871
The Moderates stand
to lose five seats.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,919
The Greens stand to lose two,
but Labour stands to gain five.

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,871
The cabinet would lose its majority,
if we had an election today.

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,752
My guest today is editor-in-chief
of the Express, Michael Laugesen.

19
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,870
In today's editorial you advise
Birgitte Nyborg to resign.

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,115
Yes. Nyborg has lost her bearings
because the problems are piling up.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,719
- A fatal mistake for a PM.
- You've graded her ministers.

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,158
You only give Minister for Finance
Bent Sejrø three out of ten.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,791
Nyborg only just makes a five.
Aren't you being a harsh examiner?

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,430
I'm sure the public agrees with me.

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,151
What is her plan for Denmark?
I'd really like to know.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,915
I don't think she's got a clue.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,914
Birgitte, you can't live on coffee and
newspapers. My wife baked rolls.

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,959
Great.
Because these fridges are empty.

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,639
How are you?
- Apart from the polls?

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,272
Cabinet seats cost.
You know who's benefitting by it.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,113
Labour.
- Exactly.

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,159
They're going
to put the squeeze on you.

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,869
What should I do?
- Give them a bit of what they want.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,996
But not everything.

35
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,429
How are things at home?
- I don't know.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,398
It's a mess.

37
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,315
We're avoiding each other.
We take turns in being with the kids -

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,270
and tell them the other one's
at work. And then we smile.

39
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,639
And where's Phillip?
- I think he's seeing someone.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,238
It doesn't matter.
Believe me.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,350
It hurts right now,
but it doesn't have to mean it's over.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,114
My husband is having an affair.

43
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,034
I don't know any happy marriages
at Parliament.

44
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,639
We're great at compromising at work,
but lousy at it at home.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,998
We don't even talk.
- So go home and talk to him.

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,713
You can't focus on work. Arrange
yourselves around where you stand.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,273
You can't be happy all the time,
but you can arrange yourselves.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,235
And eat your roll.

49
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,795
GOVERNMENT
Ep. 10- The First Tuesday in October

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,951
...every generation.

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,150
The energy, the faith, the devotion,
which we bring to this endeavor -

52
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,392
- will light our country
and all who serve it.

53
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,350
And the glow from that fire
can truly light the world.

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,069
And so, my fellow Americans:

55
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,950
Ask not what your country
can do for you.

56
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,715
Ask what you can do
for your country.

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,593
Let us make individual freedom
a common cause -

58
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,069
so we are free to...

59
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,476
...free enough to dare fight
for our common cause.

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,760
Let us create a Denmark where
everyone is free to try his fortune -

61
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,799
but bound by a common cause.

62
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,917
What do you want?
Have you been here long?

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,437
No.
I just came to catch up on work.

64
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,558
Sundays tend to be quiet.

65
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,389
What do you think?
- About?

66
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,552
The speech.
You were eavesdropping.

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,669
That's none of my business.
- Come on, Sanne. What do you think?

68
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,551
Well, I think you might like
to use another word than "bound".

69
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,030
It's as if it's something
we don't like.

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,034
"Bound by a common cause" sounds
like we don't like the common cause.

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,432
No, it encourages participation.
- It's not really my field...

72
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,196
I shouldn't have asked you.
Shut the door behind you, okay?

73
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,791
Ask not
what America will do for you -

74
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,750
- but what together we can do
for the freedom of man.

75
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,116
Looking desperate, Juul. That
opening speech giving you trouble?

76
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,831
Or have you joined the ranks of us
workaholics who work Sundays, too?

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,516
By the way. Obese little Leif Vinther
from "Stars and Royals" -

78
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,194
has been staking out Marienborg -

79
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,911
and says the PM has been sleeping
alone these past weeks. Is that true?

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,629
Being PM must put a strain
on one's private life.

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,918
Particularly, when you have to remove
your husband from a top job.

82
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,198
That's a hoax.
- It is?

83
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,956
You owe me one, Kasper.
Dogs!

84
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,837
Fine, Bjørn. Hi.
- Hi.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,913
We need to stress our collaboration
with Labour in the speech a bit.

86
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,514
Was that Marrot?

87
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,674
Are the recent polls
swelling their heads?

88
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,878
Birgitte...

89
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,749
Rumor has it you're sleeping alone
at Marienborg.

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,230
Do we need to talk about that?
- No.

91
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,236
We just don't need negative stories
about your personal life.

92
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,312
Don't you need a bath?

93
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,948
Have a nice Sunday.
- You too.

94
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,472
I didn't know you were home.
- Well, I wasn't.

95
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,950
We need to talk.
- Yes.

96
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,478
We need to find a more valid solution
for our family life.

97
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,714
I didn't know you were here.
I really need a shower.

98
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,598
Sure.

99
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,359
We can talk afterwards.
- Okay.

100
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,829
Where have you been?

101
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,717
Okay...

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,197
Who is she?
- Birgitte, don't.

103
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,717
Who is your girlfriend?
- She's not my damned girlfriend.

104
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,078
Her name is Sasha. She works
for the agency who got me the job.

105
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,597
So she's your headhunter?
- Yes.

106
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,876
After you resigned, you...
- You resigned for me.

107
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,510
And then you slept with her.
You came straight from her now?

108
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,639
Yes, dammit.
- So you're having like an affair?

109
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,948
Sorry. I just can't talk to you
like this.

110
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,271
You reek of her! Come home
smelling of another woman.

111
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,431
Birgitte...

112
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,356
Hello?

113
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,910
Where the hell have you been?
- Rhodes.

114
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,629
With the pensioner's club?
- Open it.

115
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,793
How come you didn't get a tan?
- I hate lying on the beach.

116
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,033
I stayed in my room watching
the news. Simon is their new anchor.

117
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,670
How come?
- Well, I got fired.

118
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,312
After that interview with the PM.

119
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,359
Technically, I'm on holiday,
but I doubt he wants me back.

120
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,511
Jesus Christ.

121
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,754
Maybe it's for the best.

122
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,948
We didn't see eye to eye. He sucks up
to the brass and chases the ratings.

123
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,035
I want to dig deeper.

124
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,158
Just turned 30-

125
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,155
and you want to decide the line
of the country's largest network.

126
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,075
If now isn't the time to be
an idealist, when is?

127
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,913
I don't expect you to understand.

128
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,437
What's that supposed to mean?
- You never were an idealist.

129
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,673
You've always said
you can sell any message.

130
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,354
People change, you know?

131
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,114
I'll drink to that.
- Welcome home.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,468
Good morning.

133
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,431
Did you read the speech?
- Yes. It needs a little work.

134
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,912
I agree. It does seem to echo
the words of someone else...

135
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,152
We need to discuss another issue.
Sit down.

136
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,838
Ever since I had to ask Phillip to
resign, we've been having problems.

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,755
I've spent a lot of my time
at Marienborg.

138
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,190
Okay.
- Yes.

139
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,798
I don't know where we're headed,
but I want it kept under wraps.

140
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,837
Of course.

141
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,790
Still, we have to brace ourselves
for the rumors you mentioned.

142
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:36,753
TV1 keeps asking for an interview,
both professional and personal...

143
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,710
No way, Kasper.
- I think you should reconsider.

144
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,236
If you and Phillip were
to act the happy couple -

145
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,517
we'd be able to refute the rumors.

146
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,069
You want us to act?

147
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,518
It would work,
if people were to see you together.

148
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,391
Of course, we need a skilled reporter
to interview you.

149
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,792
Who did you have in mind?
- Katrine Fønsmark.

150
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,636
She doesn't stick to the deals...
- That's the way we like them.

151
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,353
Sure, when I as Minister for the Press
honor investigative journalists...

152
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,752
She can create the private space
that becomes you so well.

153
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,708
This is our chance to control
whatever gets out of here.

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,395
It could help the lousy polls.

155
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,793
Torben. Kasper Juul speaking.

156
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,909
I've got a gift for you.
That portrait of the PM...

157
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,078
Are you in love with her?

158
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,438
No, of course not.

159
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,797
I miss you.

160
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,835
But I can't find you.

161
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,869
And when I do find you,
I don't always recognize you.

162
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,950
I know you pay a large price.

163
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,079
I just don't know
how I can change anything right now.

164
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,993
I can't invent more time.

165
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,870
It's not that you're away a lot.
It's that you're not here when you are.

166
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,554
That's how you see it.

167
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,429
The fact is we both make sacrifices.

168
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,556
Yes.

169
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,112
I don't want to lose you.

170
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,154
I have a proposition.

171
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,596
We stick together
and weather the storm.

172
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,513
I move back home.

173
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,355
You're my husband in everyday life
and in public.

174
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,718
And I'll just have to accept
that you sometimes seek...

175
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,872
...intimacy elsewhere.

176
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,230
I'm about to open Parliament
and fight for a budget bill -

177
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,472
with a cabinet
on the brink of collapse.

178
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,191
Birgitte, are you serious?
- Yes.

179
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,316
Promise me two things.

180
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,917
I want you to be discreet
about your extramarital affairs.

181
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,509
And I need you to participate
in a TV1 interview -

182
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,231
in which we end the speculations
about our personal lives.

183
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,718
Laura, let's go.
Magnus.

184
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,668
I don't want to go.

185
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,277
We don't have time for this.
- I don't want to!

186
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,230
I'll take him.
- Sure?

187
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,915
See you. Have a great day.

188
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,152
Get your bag.
- I don't want to go to school.

189
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,232
But you have to.
- I don't want to!

190
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,311
But, sweetie...

191
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,317
Good morning.
- Good morning, Magnus.

192
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,077
Magnus has come to work with me.
- What about the camera crew and...?

193
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,950
Magnus, great to see you.
I could do with a hand.

194
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,793
I bet you're good at clipping stuff.

195
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,478
I apologize for not getting you
a better secretary sooner.

196
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,997
There's no rush.
I like her interpersonal skills.

197
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,075
Sure, but those aren't the skills
we need here.

198
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,519
Is it opportune to have them film you
when you bring your son to work?

199
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,753
But they won't.
- Good.

200
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,516
Everything ready for the 8:30 news?
- Yes.

201
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,752
Excellent.

202
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,232
Hi, Katrine. There's no need
to lurk in the shadows.

203
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,150
Hi.
- Well...

204
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,519
Miss Fønsmark and I've had a deep
and personal talk about journalism -

205
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,708
and the chain of command here,
and we agreed to have another dance.

206
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,236
Great.
- Yeah, great.

207
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,951
Katrine just got
a very specific assignment.

208
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,238
The portrait of the PM
we've worked so hard to get -

209
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,675
has finally come through.

210
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,638
The PM's Office said yes?
- Yes.

211
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,679
Both at home and at the Office?
- Yes, beginning today.

212
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,311
I've decided to give Katrine
the assignment.

213
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,950
Congratulations, Katrine.
- Hang on.

214
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,999
I've been up for that portrait
from the very start.

215
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,720
Later, Ulrik.
- No, now.

216
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,793
I contacted the PM's Office
a week after Nyborg came to power -

217
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,428
and now Katrine gets it?

218
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,435
The Director General and I agree
that Katrine should do the interview.

219
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,436
She has a knack for creating
an intimate space for a conversation.

220
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,989
An intimate space?
- Yes.

221
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,438
You should discuss this in private.
- No need to.

222
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,436
Is Katrine anchoring again?
- Yes. I never promised you anything.

223
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,957
Has this got anything to do with
her ex being the PM's media adviser?

224
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,430
End of discussion.
- Torben...

225
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,036
This isn't over.

226
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,988
I wish I were dating
the PM's media adviser.

227
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,993
The Princess is back.
- Welcome back.

228
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,116
Thanks, Pia.

229
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,477
Okay, fine. Talk to you later.

230
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:39,875
Kasper, this TV1 interview...
I can't do it.

231
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,111
They'll be here in four hours.
- I know. My family's coming apart.

232
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,432
Laura doesn't talk. Magnus cries
and doesn't want to go to school.

233
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,070
Okay.

234
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,832
What if we get to see their material?
Edit it?

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,118
Edit material for the news?
That's a first.

236
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,434
We can't afford to put you
through the tabloid wringer.

237
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,068
Particularly not now.

238
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,240
See what you can do.
It's your idea. You've got four hours.

239
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,952
Jesus, Torben...

240
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,799
I'm afraid we're going to have
to cancel the interview.

241
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,919
Funny!
You are shitting me, right?

242
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,957
Sorry.

243
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,557
You can't. I have two teams standing
by day and night the next week.

244
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,679
I rehired a pain-in-the-ass reporter
because you requested her.

245
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,038
I'm sorry,
but you were outbid.

246
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,397
By whom?
- 2 are giving us editing rights.

247
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,032
What?

248
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,193
I don't fucking believe it.

249
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,319
I have to ask them what's going on.
- Be my guest.

250
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,074
But I doubt they'll own up to it.

251
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,476
It's unheard of.
- Yes.

252
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,714
In violation of every code.
- Torben, I thoroughly agree.

253
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,316
But it's practical for us,
as you very well know.

254
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,998
I knew you'd never agree to it.
- Damn straight!

255
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,756
And I accept that. Even if it only
goes for the personal part.

256
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,516
At her home. Out of consideration
for her children and her husband.

257
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,319
Birgitte is a considerate woman.

258
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,634
That's what makes her interesting.
- I know.

259
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,920
I understand your point of view,
and that's why 2 gets the story.

260
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,231
I'm sorry we wasted your time.

261
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,070
Hey, hey... Kasper.

262
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,390
Come back.

263
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,957
Shut the door.

264
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,829
If you get what you want,
I get a free hand at the PM's Office.

265
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,911
No monkeying around on your part.
- I want it in writing.

266
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,678
Fine. You'll get it in writing.

267
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,390
Thanks for the coffee.

268
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,591
The opening speech you just read
is just the first draft.

269
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,833
It's weak on environment.
- I disagree, Amir.

270
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,233
We still aim to increase the CO2 tax
and the level of green energy.

271
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,915
Sure, it's a compromise in relation
to the Greens' proposal -

272
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,073
but those are the terms
in a cabinet such as ours.

273
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,277
Any questions?

274
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,070
Yes.
- I want to discuss the polls.

275
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,719
They're not on the agenda, Pernille.

276
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,350
We can discuss them later.
- Sure.

277
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,953
Yes.

278
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,591
Please stick to our agreement,
when the camera crew is present.

279
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:54,029
Bjørn tried to talk to you yesterday
about the polls. In vain.

280
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,955
I had other things on my mind.
- Labour is the largest party now.

281
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,159
We want the minister seats
to reflect that.

282
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,791
What do you want, Bjørn?
- We feel it only fair...

283
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,511
The Ministry for Finance.
- That's Bent Sejrø's.

284
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,753
After the news about his affair
with Yvonne Kjær we can't trust him.

285
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,993
You can't be serious.
That's an old smear story.

286
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,518
Did the affair help the budget bill?
- That was my craftmanship.

287
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,036
Bent ranks lowest
on the popularity lists.

288
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,432
He holds the purse strings. Name me
one popular Minister for Finance.

289
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,594
The Minister for Finance is here.
- Ask him to wait, please.

290
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,834
Bent is getting on, too.

291
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,390
You have both the PM's Office
and the Ministry for Finance.

292
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,030
They ought to be divided among
the two largest cabinet parties.

293
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,513
This is not an ultimatum. We expect
you to make the necessary decision.

294
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,956
Thank you for our little chat.
- Thank you.

295
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,075
Great. I'll see to it.

296
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,516
I will. Okay. Bye.

297
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,871
Let's see, if it was just
a lucky punch last time -

298
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,874
or if you really do
have a knack for speeches.

299
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,959
Later.
Magnus and I are really busy.

300
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,752
I can't both look after Magnus,
do my work and now yours, too.

301
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,428
How about if we meet tonight
and go through the speech?

302
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,071
I'll buy sushi.
- Tonight?

303
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,879
Deal.
- Okay.

304
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,872
Hi. We're finished...
The PM brought her son to work?

305
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,554
Is that a regular thing?
- Bye for now.

306
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,395
Let me talk to him.
- No.

307
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:18,829
No, I'm not curtailing the free press.
Just be glad you got the interview.

308
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,432
Word is you got me the assignment.

309
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,237
You'd never do that, would you?

310
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,358
Nope...
- Thanks.

311
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,675
See you.

312
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,676
Kennedy's speech writer was
of Danish heritage. Damn straight!

313
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,072
Theodore Sorensen.
His parents emigrated to America -

314
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,631
giving their son the chance to write
speeches that changed the world.

315
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,113
The greatest thing about
Kennedy's inaugeration speech is -

316
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,192
that it's got pathos -

317
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,831
and it creates a feeling
of solidarity with the President.

318
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,033
Well, get cracking then.

319
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,998
Ask not what Nyborg can do for you...

320
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,393
...'cause she's not going to listen
anyway. So do your own stuff.

321
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,793
Sanne, I can't just copy it.
Maybe I can copy the build-up.

322
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,796
It's a three stage rocket.
- How do you mean?

323
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:41,034
Kennedy begins a sentence
with "ask not" three times.

324
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,513
That creates rhythm. The rhythm
takes us down into our body.

325
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:53,438
A politician should never speak
to the head alone, but to the gut, too.

326
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,233
And to the heart.

327
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,191
That's where the words settle.

328
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,075
I didn't think there'd still be anyone
here. Lights are out in the hall.

329
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,711
Yeah, but Birgitte needs
her speech tomorrow, so...

330
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,190
I've been giving him a hand,
but I was about to leave.

331
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,515
Thanks.
- Well, drive safely.

332
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,511
I hope you clean up your mess.

333
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,674
I don't want secretaries bawling
their eyes out in the PM's Office.

334
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,509
Of course.
- Good.

335
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,355
I look forward to hearing your speech.

336
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,554
Can the PM still find time
to bake and mow the lawn?

337
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,589
No, I don't bake.
Phillip runs the show at home.

338
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,869
My work is at the Office.
And my baking's terrible.

339
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,828
Being the PM
requires a lot of one's family.

340
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,118
Thank God,
we're all set on making it work.

341
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,512
Was that task division prepared
when the election results came in?

342
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,629
No, we weren't prepared
for anything like that.

343
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,117
I think the most important thing
is having the right husband.

344
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,831
And I have.
Otherwise itjust wouldn't work out.

345
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,358
That makes heavy calls on the right
man. Where do you find the energy?

346
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,592
Well...

347
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,070
Finding the energy
for the people you love -

348
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,870
comes quite naturally, really.

349
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,197
Are you going skating tomorrow?
- Yes, I'm going with Mathilde.

350
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,352
I can drive you.
- You don't have to.

351
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,512
Can I leave the table?
I'm finished.

352
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,558
It was great.
- Thank you.

353
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,153
Great food.
- Thank you.

354
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,230
I've got that meeting.
- Yes.

355
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,950
Thanks for your help.
I think the interview went really well.

356
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,270
Will you be back
before the kids wake up?

357
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,635
Of course.

358
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,678
Bye.

359
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,072
Hi, Kasper.
- Sorry to disturb.

360
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,152
I've arranged
with the head of news -

361
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,190
to go through the interview
tomorrow. Katrine won't be told.

362
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,798
If we make any changes,
he'll say it was his call.

363
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,350
I don't like it.

364
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,988
It's below our standards.

365
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,553
It was your idea.
I'd never have agreed to it otherwise.

366
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,598
Dig out your inner cynic
or regard it an order -

367
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,629
- if that makes it easier.
Okay? Bye.

368
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,559
Laura?

369
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,559
Where did Dad go?
- He had a meeting.

370
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,998
What kind of meeting?
- I don't know. Just a meeting.

371
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,948
What are they meeting about?
- It's just a meeting.

372
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,477
What kind of meeting?
- Just a meeting, Laura!

373
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,713
I'm sorry. Sorry.

374
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,917
I guess I'm a bit tired.

375
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:50,916
What's going on with you and Dad?
- I don't know.

376
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,837
We're going through a difficult time.
We make each other very unhappy.

377
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,716
But we're fighting.
We'll work it out.

378
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
We'll work it out.

379
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,032
That makes heavy calls on the right
man. Where do you find the energy?

380
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,510
Finding the energy
for the people you love...

381
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,719
- It comes quite naturally, really.
- And cut.

382
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,318
How about the clip where Phillip
talks about Birgitte's devotion?

383
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,837
Which one?
- There was this one clip.

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,912
Go on... That one.

385
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,310
What word sums up Birgitte?

386
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,677
Devoted.

387
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,472
I've never met anyone
as devoted as Birgitte in my life.

388
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,636
Shejust can't help fighting
for the things she believes in.

389
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,917
You wanted that out before.

390
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,551
Edit in a clip of Birgitte and the kids
between those two statements.

391
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,430
We have the two clips of her
helping the kids with their homework.

392
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,277
Ulrik, didn't you see
the 'Do not disturb' sign?

393
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,274
Have we got a new editor?
Where's Katrine?

394
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,399
Ulrik, we're working.
Do you mind?

395
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,918
Katrine, I just saw something
that might interest you.

396
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,993
Watch this then.
- Devoted.

397
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,551
I've never met anyone
as devoted as Birgitte in my life.

398
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,109
Shejust can't help fighting
for the things she believes in.

399
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,838
Sanne, I don't want to be disturbed.

400
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,389
Birgitte?

401
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,079
Hi.

402
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,879
I didn't stay at Sasha's last night.
- You don't have to tell me.

403
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,270
I haven't slept at all.

404
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,994
I've been sitting in the car all night
thinking about yesterday.

405
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:50,039
Remember when we saw
Lars Hesselboe and his wife on TV -

406
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,192
just after the election?

407
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,429
We didn't want to end like them.

408
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,479
That was one year ago, Birgitte.
- We need to give it time.

409
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,519
No. Please listen
to what I have to say.

410
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,189
The best thing
that's ever happened to me...

411
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,276
...is what you and I had.

412
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,954
You and me.

413
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,834
But... in that interview yesterday -

414
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,073
we turned all that into a travesty.

415
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,710
And we aced it.
I mean, we...

416
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,115
We sat there betraying it
with big smiles on our faces.

417
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,593
But I won't, Birgitte.
And I can't.

418
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,557
What do you want?

419
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,635
I want a divorce
as soon as possible.

420
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,398
I don't want this to be
what we remember.

421
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,713
Excuse me.

422
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,872
Christ!
- Birgitte.

423
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,077
Kasper. We have a problem.

424
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,913
I'm getting a divorce.

425
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,672
Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.

426
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,913
About the portrait...
- I'll handle it.

427
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,036
Thanks.

428
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:40,831
Devoted. I've never met anyone
as devoted as Birgitte...

429
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,835
I'm afraid we have to call it off.
- What do you mean?

430
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,958
We can't show it.
- But we've edited it.

431
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,634
Things have changed.

432
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,110
I want you to delete all footage
from the PM's home.

433
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,798
No way! We've been working
around the clock. You can't ask us to.

434
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,433
Torben Friis has given us full veto
over the program.

435
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,591
How's it going?

436
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,594
I presume you cleared all this
with your people?

437
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:19,198
What's the problem?
- Have you got a minute?

438
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:24,480
We have to find a compromise.
- We have an agreement.

439
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,676
Yes.

440
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,799
I presume Katrine doesn't need
to know anything about this.

441
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,558
I'll make it look
as if it came from upstairs.

442
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,955
The Express keeps writing
about my affair with Yvonne.

443
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:01,432
It's pure spin.
Someone is out to discredit me.

444
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,750
Who?
- It could be anyone.

445
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,118
Hesselboe... to get Yvonne
back in the fold.

446
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,877
These rumors are bound
to make her keep her distance.

447
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,191
Or Labour.
- Why?

448
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,876
You said yourself their polls are
making their heads swell.

449
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,999
No! Oh, to hell with it.

450
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,358
I'm not going
to let that crap get to me.

451
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,916
How is your wife taking it?
- She...

452
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,029
We've arranged ourselves.

453
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,431
What about you?

454
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,276
It was too late.
I'm getting a divorce.

455
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,634
Oh dear.

456
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,312
Is there anything I can do?

457
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,676
We need to talk.

458
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,595
"The prize is awarded for the series
on the legal system's pitfalls -

459
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,639
told with deep respect for that
most sacred virtue of journalism. "

460
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,872
"Political independence
and impartiality. "

461
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,955
That was the Cavling Committee's
motivation for awarding you the prize.

462
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:52,708
How the hell could you do it?
- 2 was going to get the portrait.

463
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,908
You let the PM's media adviser
edit a news story!

464
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,029
As the largest network in the country
we have many agendas.

465
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,193
Appropriations, the new media bill,
thousands of things.

466
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,639
No, there's only one thing!
You betrayed your responsibility.

467
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,511
Abroad, reporters risk their lives to
defend the free press. You piss on it!

468
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,199
You let them shut you up,
and I want no part of it.

469
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,239
I'll e-mail my resignation.

470
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,350
I'm sorry about you and Phillip.
Tell me, if there's anything I can do.

471
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,035
Thanks.
Let's keep it under wraps for now.

472
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,273
We won't tell the kids until Tuesday
after the opening of Parliament.

473
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,230
And when we do go public,
keep it short and usentimental.

474
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,270
The more we tone it down,
the less sympathy you'll get.

475
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,514
You can't have it all.
That reminds me of the speech.

476
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,312
Great work, but I want
the speech to be more ambitious.

477
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,429
Fine. What do you want?
Why should I vote for you?

478
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,910
Have you got any agenda
apart from clinging to power?

479
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,079
We've made a hell of a lot of changes
this past year.

480
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,959
What do you want?

481
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,150
I want to tell the Danes
they're better than they think.

482
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,756
They've forgotten that -

483
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,789
in their quest for a new car
and a cool kitchen -

484
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,236
a great family,
a mistress and a yacht.

485
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,394
We've been busy
pursuing our own happiness.

486
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,155
And we feel unfairly treated,
if we don't get it.

487
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,959
But we can't have it all.

488
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,193
Don't make it a slap on the wrist.
We want people to come together.

489
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:12,754
Danes are all for solidarity. They're
always ready to make sacrifices.

490
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,628
But we lost sight of it. Now we just
sing about it at funerals.

491
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,190
"Fight and live for all you love. "

492
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,349
That could work.

493
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,592
I've got it,
and you're going to love it.

494
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,437
I'm going to write it in the Hall
of Mirrors. Say I'm in a meeting, okay?

495
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,594
Kasper, about last night...

496
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,312
Sure.
Listen, I...

497
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,429
I loved going over the speech
with you.

498
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,875
And I loved...

499
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,348
I loved...

500
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,112
Under normal circumstances
I'd ask you out now -

501
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,875
hoping to pick up where we left...

502
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,510
But you can't have everything.
- No.

503
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,157
Birgitte.

504
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,110
The press won't let up on Sejrø.
- In whose interest, I wonder?

505
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,559
When a personal matter weakens
the cabinet, it interests the public.

506
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,671
We're talking about an old affair, not
high treason. I refuse to discuss it.

507
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,834
I hope you won't refuse to talk about
a more fair division of ministries.

508
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,030
Our Party is very insistent,
and the Greens back us up.

509
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,595
Have you held talks
behind my back?

510
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,594
Amir sympathizes with our stand.

511
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,878
I need to open Parliament on Tuesday
with my cabinet behind me.

512
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,194
I find your timing odd.
- Our timing is perfect.

513
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,990
We'll start off the year with a small
cabinet rotation to trim the team.

514
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,879
You want to stay in power.

515
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,750
We stand stronger with the public
than you do. That's the simple truth.

516
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,671
Well, thank you for our little chat.

517
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,279
Please sign these before you go.

518
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,110
Could I talk to you later?
- Sure.

519
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,758
I just had a little chat with Labour.

520
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:20,270
Inform the Queen
we're appointing a new minister.

521
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,829
I'll inform the Lord Chamberlain.

522
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,391
I want to meet with the Minister
for Finance before he leaves.

523
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:31,712
Set up a meeting with him.
- Very well.

524
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,440
Thanks.

525
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,677
Thanks.

526
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,512
Labour is putting the squeeze on me.

527
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,038
They say your affair has caused a lack
of faith between the cabinet parties.

528
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,351
Bullshit.
- Amir is backing them up.

529
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,990
Do they want me to make
a public apology?

530
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,154
"Sorry I had sex with that woman. "
- It's got nothing to do with that.

531
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,596
They're using the affair
to a different end.

532
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,389
Bent, they want
the Ministry for Finance.

533
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,997
Hell, Birgitte,
you don't have to comply.

534
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,758
I'm not finished yet.
Sure, I'm getting on -

535
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,515
but I'm experienced,
and I know the game.

536
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,118
Politics has always been my life.
- Yes, and this is politics.

537
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,829
I need you to resign.

538
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:21,951
Okay... I guess I'll have more time
for my hydrangeas.

539
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:31,193
It's the first Tuesday in October,
and focus is on the speech -

540
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,239
- with which Birgitte Nyborg
is going to open Parliament.

541
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,076
The PM's cabinet rotation
is the talk of the town.

542
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,153
Bent Sejrø has resigned
as Minister for Finance -

543
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,313
and Nyborg strengthened
the ties to Labour -

544
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,029
by making Pernille Madsen
his successor.

545
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:56,398
Commentators call this rotation -

546
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,111
a strong display of power
from a resolute and realistic PM.

547
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,071
The Prime Minister has the floor.

548
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,956
What ties a nation together?

549
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:43,433
As a young student, I was there on
the Town Square on June 26, 1992.

550
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,678
Denmark had just won
the European Football Championship.

551
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,118
That night I knew
we were one people.

552
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,513
One people who almost knew
the national anthem by heart.

553
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,989
We were amazed.

554
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,232
The past 140 years had taught us
we were a nation -

555
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,598
of kind-hearted losers who were
almost always beaten by the Germans.

556
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,435
Suddenly we had beaten them.

557
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,717
We've gotten used to the fact
that we can have it all.

558
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:20,317
Now that we aren't as rich anymore,
we feel lost -

559
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,519
and we worry about things that
would never have mattered before.

560
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:28,195
Look what I can do.

561
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:37,349
Each of us in Parliament
represents 30,000 Danes.

562
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,274
They've invested all their hopes
of a better future in us.

563
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:48,516
We need to act responsibly
way beyond party differences -

564
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,717
short-sighted bloc politics
and smear campaigns.

565
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,556
I believe we need each other.

566
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,512
I believe we belong together
as a nation.

567
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,073
I believe we're united by more
than separates us.

568
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,552
I believe deep down
we're the same people -

569
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,236
- who all rejoiced that night in June
on the Town Square.

570
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,269
For those of you who have forgotten
the lyrics, the anthem ends:

571
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,399
"Our ancient Denmark shall abide. "

572
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,669
Let's see to that...

573
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,513
...together.

574
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,832
Thank you.

575
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,631
Fantastic speech.
- You never were better.

576
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,677
Magnificent.

577
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,631
Lars Hesselboe, what was it like
to see someone else give the speech?

578
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,553
It was the usual empty rhetoric.

579
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:03,272
May I, off the record, commend you
on an exceptionally fine speech?

580
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,113
Thank you, Svend Åge.

581
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:17,150
I did what was necessary.
- That's what a PM does.

582
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,550
Kasper, great speech.
- Thank you.

583
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,634
Katrine, what's up?

584
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,828
Great speech. Probably
the best opening speech ever.

585
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,915
You don't sound very sincere.
- Oh, I'm sincere.

586
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,594
You're good at keeping things apart.

587
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,278
You can write heartfelt speeches
and still act the cynic.

588
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,436
I quit my job. I got wind
of your little deal with Torben Friis.

589
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,275
Let me explain.
- Forget it.

590
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,194
You've got your secrets,
and I'm naive. We never change.

591
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:17,069
Sure we do.
- No.

592
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,549
But keep dreaming.

593
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,435
So you quit. Then what?

594
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,352
There she is.
- Hi, Mom.

595
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:42,795
Great speech.

596
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,350
Congratulations.
We'll head on home.

597
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,632
When are you coming home?
- Late, I'm afraid.

598
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,633
Come along, kids.

599
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,836
Bye.

600
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,958
See you.
- Yes. See you.

601
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,790
Can I say something?

602
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:26,909
That was one of the best opening
speeches I've heard in my time here.

603
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:31,949
I didn't think
you'd last a year -

604
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:37,194
but if you keep this up,
we can keep up the good work.

605
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:43,514
I finally found due cause
to get rid of Sanne.

606
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,516
Staff issues, don't worry about it.
Your new secretary starts tomorrow.

607
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,559
Top-notch.
- Thanks.

608
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,074
