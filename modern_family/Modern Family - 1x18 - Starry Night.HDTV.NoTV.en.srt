1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
What's my favorite way to relax?

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:04,270
Throw on my wireless headphones

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,972
And disappear into
the nature channel.

4
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:15,781
The fascinating thing about nature

5
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:17,115
Is how, in the blink of an eye,

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,852
It can go from a scene
of total tranquil beauty

7
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,255
To raw, primal violence.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:26,024
Could you seriously not hear
me with those things on?

9
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,926
It's noise-canceling technology.

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,429
Give it a spin.
It's got -- sweetie! Focus.

11
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:32,164
Mom, why are you
freaking out on everyone?

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,366
Because you are acting very
irresponsibly -- all of you.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,635
Listen, honey,
luke has a giant project

14
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,403
Due tomorrow for school
that he hasn't even started,

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,806
And haley just informed
me she needs 40 cupcakes

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,208
For her school fundraiser,
also due tomorrow.

17
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,610
I'd like to point out

18
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:47,980
I completed all my assignments
on my own and on time.

19
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,147
Not now, alex. Not now, alex.

20
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,183
Okay, look,
I will take the cupcakes.

21
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,619
You do the project.
It's on vincent van gogh. Done.

22
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,187
Okay, I need you to
really stay on him,

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,521
Keep him focused.

24
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,789
All right.

25
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,157
I'm...Actually gonna take
a different approach,

26
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,526
But... Actually gonna
insist that you don't.

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,329
Claire, I know you've got
your methods, but so do I.

28
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,465
I'm sorry,
but I'm not a cromanager.

29
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,467
Trust me, I can provide luke

30
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,603
With the tools and guidance
he needs without, uh,

31
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,171
Smothering him.

32
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,107
You think I smother our child?

33
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,843
It's not your fault, honey.
"mother" is part of the word.

34
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,512
You never hear of anyone
being "sfathered" to death.

35
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:22,314
I know what luke's problem is.

36
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,849
He's got adhd.

37
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:25,851
No. No, I don't!

38
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,119
What is it?

39
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,187
I'd tell you, but you'd wander off

40
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,289
Before I got to the "h."

41
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:31,523
Just promise me

42
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:33,892
That you will stay on him
until this project is done.

43
00:01:33,926 --> 00:01:36,495
I will, but you might have a
little more confidence in him.

44
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:41,366
wah. Wah. No one can hear me now.

45
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,302
Whoooo!

46
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,105
Everybody is stupid, except me.

47
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,309
Ha ha ha. I am funny.

48
00:01:52,218 --> 00:02:02,220
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

49
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,924
Is this the cutest
thing I've ever seen?

50
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:07,002
You out here on the curb

51
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,094
With your little telescope,
waiting for your dad.

52
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,829
It's not cute.
It's -- it's science.

53
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,399
Tonight is the magnificent
lyrid meteor shower.

54
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:17,136
It's where the planet geek
passes through the nerdy way.

55
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,871
Oh, you know I think it's sweet.

56
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,572
Every couple years,
mitchell and his father,

57
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,474
They go out and enjoy one
of these showers together.

58
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,177
Well, I -- I wouldn't
necessarily put it that way.

59
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,012
I mean, yes,
me and my father enjoy it

60
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,548
Because we -- we don't share
a lot of the same interests.

61
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,085
Like, um, I-I never went
to sports games with him.

62
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,320
Probably because you call them "
sports games."

63
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,790
Just lose the "sports."

64
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,659
Just -- just "games."

65
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,127
Oh, here comes your shower partner.

66
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,228
Stop it!

67
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,197
I'm kidding. Have fun
with your dad, okay?

68
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,765
All right. See you later.

69
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,767
Don't worry about me. I'm not.

70
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,737
I'm just saying, if you were.

71
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,405
Shotgun, sucker!

72
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,445
Make sure the seat is
exactly the way you want it

73
00:02:59,551 --> 00:03:01,386
And feel free to play with any
of these controls up here.

74
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,487
I have no idea what they do.

75
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:05,723
<i>But I want mi car to be su car.</i>

76
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:09,093
Cameron, are you okay?
You seem nervous.

77
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:11,696
Uh, nervous? No, I'm...Not nervous.

78
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:15,066
<i>I was nervous.</i>

79
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,168
I mean, when mitchell made
plans with his father,

80
00:03:17,202 --> 00:03:19,637
I figured, why not spend
the evening with gloria?

81
00:03:19,672 --> 00:03:21,973
I've always wanted to be
good friends with her.

82
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,908
<i>On paper, we should be
good friends.</i>

83
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,377
Look at us -- one spicy,
curvy diva --

84
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:28,746
And gloria.

85
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:31,115
The problem is, I had a little,
minor setback

86
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,685
That we had to overcome
from a couple weeks ago.

87
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,454
I cannot stand hanging out with his ivy
league friends. Oh, they're the worst.

88
00:03:36,488 --> 00:03:37,955
<i>They're not that bad.
They are the worst.</i>

89
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,524
They're not that bad.
Are you kidding me?

90
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:40,692
Debbie can't go two minutes

91
00:03:40,726 --> 00:03:42,093
Without talking about
columbia university,

92
00:03:42,127 --> 00:03:44,362
And the little guy with
the lazy eye from harvard.

93
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,663
Brown. Whatever.

94
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,265
Honestly, I wish that tart
would go back to columbia

95
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,501
And take her weird,
little brown friend with her.

96
00:03:58,443 --> 00:04:00,277
Cam, you need to relax.
You explained.

97
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,279
Not very well.

98
00:04:02,314 --> 00:04:05,316
You know how awkward I get
when things get awkward.

99
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,117
So when I was id "brown people,"

100
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,553
I-I wasn't talking about your,
uh, brown people.

101
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:13,190
I was talking about people
who go to a university,

102
00:04:13,225 --> 00:04:14,758
Um, not your people.

103
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:17,862
Not -- not that your people
couldn't go to college.

104
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:20,965
Okay, now I'm hearing myself say "
your people" a lot, so...

105
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:26,237
I'm just very excited
because this is, um --

106
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:28,806
You know, this is our
first night out together,

107
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
So it's our little date.

108
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,275
Where are we going?

109
00:04:31,309 --> 00:04:33,444
Make sure your seat belt
is securely fastened

110
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,779
And your tray tables are
in the upright position,

111
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:38,382
Because I got us into palaiseau!

112
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,950
fancy.

113
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:41,919
I know, it's normally
a 4-week wait,

114
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:44,455
But the maitre d' is an old
pilates brother of mine,

115
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:45,656
So just one phone call.

116
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,024
Okay.

117
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:49,093
Palaiseau!

118
00:04:50,896 --> 00:04:52,730
<i>Ay, cameron, you know what?</i>

119
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,766
I don't know if I'm in the
mood for something so fancy.

120
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,402
Can we just go somewhere,
like, more simple?

121
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,971
Oh, of -- yes. Yes, of course.

122
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:05,442
We can -- what -- what do you
what did you have in mind?

123
00:05:05,477 --> 00:05:06,710
I don't know.

124
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,948
How about a little latin place
that I always used to go?

125
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,316
That sounds fantastic. Okay.

126
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,785
I would love to see
how your people eat.

127
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,654
"your people"?

128
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:19,655
What is wrong with me?

129
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,391
Okay, it's egg-crackin' time.

130
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:23,560
Now, I find the key to
cracking an egg properly --

131
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:25,862
Mom, I'm not a child. I can do it.

132
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,030
Okay.

133
00:05:27,064 --> 00:05:28,498
Okay.             Okay.

134
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:29,666
My mom's not dumb.

135
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,335
You can't just ask her
to do something for you.

136
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,306
You have to very carefully
put the cheese in the trap.

137
00:05:38,976 --> 00:05:40,977
Uh, oops. I got a little
shell in the bowl.

138
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:42,912
And when --
when that happens, I find

139
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:45,048
That I like to not dig it out -- I got it.
It's okay. It's right here.

140
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,750
Oh, that's -- that's really gross.

141
00:05:46,784 --> 00:05:48,418
Okay, I'm gonna -- I'll do this.

142
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,654
You just...Mop up.

143
00:05:50,688 --> 00:05:52,689
And...Snap!

144
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,858
Is it bad that I
feel sorry for her?

145
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,360
So, how do I start?

146
00:05:57,394 --> 00:05:59,028
<i>What do you think?</i>

147
00:05:59,062 --> 00:06:01,997
I don't know. Mom usually
tells me what to do.

148
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:04,867
Join the club. I'm kidding.
I love your mom.

149
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:08,738
We are going to try a
new approach this time.

150
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:10,573
Now, your goal is
to create a display

151
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:12,408
About the life and art
of van gogh, right?

152
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:13,642
Yeah.

153
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:16,612
Okay, I got your poster
board right here,

154
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:20,049
So pretend you're telling
the story of his life

155
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,817
To someone who has
never heard of him.

156
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:25,488
What do you put on that board?

157
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:28,591
I see the wheels spinning,
the spark of creat--

158
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,092
How do they get the
lead in pencils?

159
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:31,494
Okay, let's try to stay on topic.

160
00:06:31,528 --> 00:06:33,129
Hey, jay, look who thinks

161
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:36,432
Mercury is the densest
planet in the solar system.

162
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,802
I take it from your mocking
tone that I am incorrect.

163
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:41,437
The densest planet is earth.

164
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,540
Which makes you the densest
guy on the densest planet.

165
00:06:44,574 --> 00:06:45,875
Zing!

166
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,009
Fun.

167
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:49,078
You sure mitchell won't
mind me tagging ong?

168
00:06:49,112 --> 00:06:50,679
Are you kidding? He loves you.

169
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,181
What are you worried about?

170
00:06:52,215 --> 00:06:54,150
I've never had a brother before.

171
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,218
We never really hung out that much.

172
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,421
Kiddo, you are overthinking this.

173
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,189
I just don't want to
say the wrong thing.

174
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,258
You can't. That's the
beauty of having a brother.

175
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:04,560
Me and my brother were zinging
each other all the time,

176
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:07,096
You know, like,
"what's going on, fat boy?"

177
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,366
"nothing much, jackass.
" you know, things of that nature.

178
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,269
It's -- it's how
brothers express love.

179
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,637
Hmm.

180
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:19,208
Shotgun, sucker!

181
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:23,512
yeah.

182
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,849
I'm gonna... See the sights.

183
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:29,684
Not if they see you first!

184
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,454
Kind of missed with that one, kid.

185
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:39,227
All right, this is all you
need to know right here.

186
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,929
Apparently, the
pencil's in two pieces,

187
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,864
And they glue th
together around the lead.

188
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,733
What if we put all the sff
about his life on this side

189
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:48,369
And all the stuff about his
paintings on this side?

190
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,371
Luke, buddy, that's fantastic.

191
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,741
And the best part is you came
up with that by yourself.

192
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:56,978
All it took was a little
bit of focus and, uh...

193
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,847
This thing is really loose.

194
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,783
I'm gonna go grab a screwdriver,
but you run with this.

195
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:04,285
On your mark, get set, van gogh!

196
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,620
Hey, dad.

197
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:07,689
He kind of looks
like uncle mitchell,

198
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,524
If uncle mitchell were insane.

199
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,994
Aah!

200
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:14,629
I got sprayed by a skunk!

201
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,364
Oh! Ugh!

202
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:17,632
Oh, you stink.

203
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,535
And not just at astronomy! Blammo!

204
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,573
What is happening?

205
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:26,258
I love this place.

206
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,727
I was a little bit worried,
because it's not exactly --

207
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:31,630
I...Love...This place.

208
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,933
I...Was...Nervous.

209
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,569
I mean, there was a lot of
different food on the menu.

210
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,371
And on the floor. And on the wall.

211
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:42,341
Are we -- are we sure we're not
exaggerating just a little bit?

212
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:43,475
Were you there, mitchell?

213
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:44,743
Because I think I
would've recognized

214
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:46,812
The only other white or gay person.

215
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,947
I had already offended gloria once.

216
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:50,949
Not gonna do it again.

217
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:52,284
<i>Hello. Â¿cÃ³mo estÃ¡?</i>

218
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:53,552
Gloria!

219
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:55,654
<i>Desde hace mucho que no vienes.</i>

220
00:08:55,688 --> 00:08:57,623
<i>Mi amigo, cameron. Oh, welcome.</i>

221
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:00,158
<i>So, carnitas diablos?</i>

222
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,460
Ah, you remember!

223
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:03,295
Uh, I'll just have the same thing.

224
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,998
No, no, no, no, no, you should have
the chicken enchiladas. Mm-hmm.

225
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:09,001
<i>Uh, no, I'll have the
carnitas diablos.</i>

226
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:10,369
These are not for you.

227
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,271
Excuse me? They're too spicy.

228
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,273
And this girl is used to it.
Yeah, he's right.

229
00:09:14,307 --> 00:09:16,808
I can spice you under
the table any day,

230
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:18,443
There, sweet thing.

231
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:22,447
<i>Dos carnitas diablos, por favor.</i>

232
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:23,548
Okay.

233
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,484
Okay.

234
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,954
Mitchell.

235
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:31,455
Of course. What was I thinking?

236
00:09:32,691 --> 00:09:34,825
Dad, can we --
can we just go home, please?

237
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,361
You've got to air out first
before I let you in that car.

238
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:38,929
I'll never get the stink out.

239
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,398
Hey, jay, is that venus?

240
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:44,035
'cause I can smell the clouds
of pure sulfuric acid from here.

241
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,236
Slam!

242
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,705
Okay, I-I -- I'd really
like to go home now.

243
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:49,206
We'll miss the meteor shower.

244
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:51,409
The trouble is your clothes.
Just take them off.

245
00:09:51,476 --> 00:09:53,477
I think there's a blanket
in the trunk. You sure, dad?

246
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,813
You're -- you're not worried
I might stink up the blanket?

247
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:56,947
Don't worry about it.

248
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,816
We just use it to cover up the seat

249
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,252
For when manny's all sweaty
after his tango class.

250
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:04,021
If you don't sweat,
you're not doing it right.

251
00:10:09,628 --> 00:10:12,863
So, he was one of the best
boyfriends I ever had.

252
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:14,432
But he was gay.

253
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:17,134
Yeah, I figured that out
after the first month,

254
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:18,635
But I stayed for a whole year

255
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,437
Because the haircuts
were fantastic!

256
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:24,041
it's funny, huh?

257
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,243
Cameron, come on,
it's not that funny.

258
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:27,778
Are you okay I'm fine.

259
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,580
Are you sure? I love this place.

260
00:10:31,182 --> 00:10:32,783
But your head is running water.

261
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,618
No, I don't think it is.

262
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:37,788
I told you it was too spicy for you!
Look at your shirt!

263
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:40,390
No, I just need to get a little bit of a
drink of something. No, no, no, no, no.

264
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,292
Cameron, the water
makes it so worse.

265
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,327
No!

266
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:46,897
Oh, you're right.
That does make it worse.

267
00:10:46,931 --> 00:10:49,266
I feel like I ate the sun!

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,736
And that is the secret
to no lumps. See?

269
00:10:53,771 --> 00:10:54,771
It's kind of fun.

270
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,039
You make it fun, mom.

271
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,541
Mmm. Listen to these
symptoms of adhd

272
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,343
And tell me it's not luke. Alex.

273
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:03,279
"easily distracted by
irrelevant stimuli."

274
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:17,126
"often impulsively abandons
one task for another."

275
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,034
That's where I left those.

276
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,937
"a tendency to act without
regard to consequences,

277
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:31,574
Often at the expense
of personal safety."

278
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,726
"having accidents more often --"

279
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,461
Okay, you know what?
I think that that's enough, alex.

280
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:52,562
We've -- we've got it.

281
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:10,979
Okay, no. No.

282
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:17,652
Phil? Phil, honey, are you okay?

283
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:18,787
Yeah.

284
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,789
Remember those sunglasses
I couldn't find?

285
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:22,390
Bingo!

286
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:26,094
I asked you to do one thing
stay on top of luke.

287
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,296
For your information,
your son is hard at work

288
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,932
On an awesome van gogh - got
to fix that -- masterpiece.

289
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,000
Wait till you see.

290
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,768
You're gonna be so surprised.

291
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,603
Oh, god, honey, I want nothing more

292
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:37,739
Than to be surprised, really.

293
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,711
Oh.

294
00:12:42,745 --> 00:12:44,412
I'm not surprised.

295
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:47,382
Okay, that's it.

296
00:12:47,416 --> 00:12:48,717
I don't want to hear anything

297
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,318
About your new method
of doing things.

298
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,187
There's one thing that
works with these kids,

299
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,055
And that is staying on top of them,

300
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:55,890
Which, thanks to you, my friend,

301
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,126
I will now be able
to do all night long.

302
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:06,868
Not happy, dude.

303
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:08,003
You're supposed to be working.

304
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,004
<i>I am working.</i>

305
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:12,307
I know what you think, but -- no,
I don't want to hear it.

306
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,641
I'm going down to
clean up the garage.

307
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,377
Then I'm coming back,
and I'm gonna stand over you

308
00:13:15,411 --> 00:13:17,545
Until this thing is done, okay?

309
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:26,988
Breathe. Breathing only
makes the fire spread.

310
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,056
Okay, then drink this milk.

311
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,324
<i>Ay, cam!</i>

312
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:33,094
Why did you have to
orr that spicy dish?

313
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:35,196
Because I'm -- I'm a big idiot.

314
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,798
And I wanted to have
this awesome night

315
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,233
Between the two of us,

316
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,035
Where we end up best friends,

317
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,370
Uh, having lunch, buying shoes.

318
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,371
Okay!

319
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,508
Let's go have lunch!
Let's go buy shoes!

320
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:48,843
Really?

321
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:51,979
Yeah, why are you so surprised?
I don't know.

322
00:13:52,013 --> 00:13:55,049
I guess I just always feel like
I-I blow it with you, gloria.

323
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,884
Whether it's the colombian comment

324
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,786
Or picking the wrong restaurant --

325
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,954
The restaurant?

326
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:02,256
That had nothing to do with you.

327
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,760
I was just not in the mood
to go anywhere that fancy

328
00:14:05,794 --> 00:14:08,629
After the stupid thing
I did this morning.

329
00:14:08,663 --> 00:14:10,865
What did you do?

330
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:13,234
I bought a dress.

331
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,401
You monster.

332
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,505
It was a very expensive
dress that I don't need.

333
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,573
I felt so stupid
that when I got home,

334
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,842
I couldn't even bring
it inside the house.

335
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,177
I left it in the car.

336
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,546
I totally get it.
I have a legendary hat story.

337
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,715
I'll bet you look
fabulous in that dress.

338
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:30,851
Yes, but anyone would
look fabulous in at dress.

339
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,220
You find that blanket?

340
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:35,489
No.

341
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:37,958
This was all I could find. Shut up!

342
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:39,360
Really shows off your shape.

343
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:42,196
Okay. Spin around, cupcake.
Let's see the caboose.

344
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,299
you get fries with that shake?

345
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,935
Was that too far?

346
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:50,537
There's a line, jay.

347
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:53,373
I better go mop this up.

348
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:56,776
Oh, come on. Where's the...

349
00:14:59,446 --> 00:15:02,182
I'm sorry if things got a
little out of hand back there,

350
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:04,717
But in our defense, look at you.

351
00:15:04,752 --> 00:15:07,220
I mean, smell you.

352
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,522
This is a fantastic apology.

353
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,157
Oh, don't be too hard on the kid.

354
00:15:11,192 --> 00:15:12,725
I was egging him on.

355
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,595
If you're gonna be mad, bead at me.

356
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,230
Done.

357
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,332
I was just happy to see
him laugh a little bit.

358
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,167
You know, he's had
kind of a tough week.

359
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:22,735
I got sprayed by a skunk,

360
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,039
And I'm wearing a dress that
makes my hips look huge.

361
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:28,675
I know he doesn't want
me to talk about it,

362
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,411
But he didn't get invited
to this big party.

363
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:35,415
Some kids he thought were his
friends think he's weird.

364
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,217
Now, you know me on this.

365
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,885
I'm no -- I'm no good at it,
you know?

366
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,020
I-I never know what to say.

367
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,488
Well, that's true.

368
00:15:42,523 --> 00:15:45,592
<i>But maybe I raised a kid who
would know what to say.</i>

369
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:49,295
Now, that's the only
reason I invited him along,

370
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,930
You know, because
this astronomy stuff

371
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,966
That's -- that's our thing.

372
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,670
Yeah, no, I'll -- I'll talk to him.

373
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,706
You know, you don't
look that ridiculous.

374
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,841
Now, you -- you actually
got the legs for it.

375
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,209
Dad --

376
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:05,578
No, I'm just saying, if you
were that type of a gay... Dad!

377
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,180
...You'd probably do
all right for yourself.

378
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:09,415
Come on!

379
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:14,453
You know, I always had a sense
it was dangerous down here,

380
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:17,390
But I guess it's actually
kind of charming, isn't it?

381
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:18,824
No, it's not safe at all.

382
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:22,294
I used to live down here,
you know? What?

383
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,029
Yeah, that's why I come down here.

384
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,133
Look there.
That was my old apartment.

385
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,869
After I left javier,
that's all I could afford.

386
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,170
It's still part of me. Hmm.

387
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,873
You have to remember
those things. You do.

388
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,541
Like you when you go to your farm.

389
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:38,877
You remember that?
I told you that a year ago.

390
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:41,880
Of course I do. You're my friend,
you big idiot!

391
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:45,851
You know, this part of
town might be very rough,

392
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:47,886
But the people here, cameron --

393
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,154
The best.

394
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,358
I'm pretty sure I had
wheels when I parked here.

395
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,927
<i>Ay-yi-yi! Who did this?!</i>

396
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,495
Oh, no, it's okay, gloria.

397
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:59,631
Who did this? !
You coward sons of bitches!

398
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:02,434
It's okay, everybody!
I'm - I'm insured!

399
00:17:02,468 --> 00:17:04,303
What? You scared?!

400
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:06,038
You scared to show your faces,
little girls?!

401
00:17:06,072 --> 00:17:08,740
No, no, it's all right,
everybody! Huh?! Cameron, wait in the car!

402
00:17:08,775 --> 00:17:11,944
Cameron! Gloria,
I think it's drivable!

403
00:17:11,978 --> 00:17:13,412
Gloria!

404
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,249
Just so you know,
I'm going back up to luke's room,

405
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,783
And I'm not leaving
until he's finished.

406
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,051
Thank you.

407
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:23,255
And I'm really sorry for not
underestimating luke enough.

408
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:24,956
Well, that means a lot to me.

409
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,393
The hardest part is he kind of
takes after me with all this. Hmm.

410
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:30,795
Like my lack of focus
and your -- my what?

411
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,199
I just love you. Hmm?

412
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:39,671
I did it. Buddy!

413
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh, my god.

414
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:42,974
Do you like it?

415
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:44,509
I-I-I love it.

416
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:47,245
Did you  this? All him.

417
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,613
I used mr. Potato head ears

418
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,415
Because van gogh cut his ear off.

419
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:52,684
And there's money,
because his paintings sell

420
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,386
For, like, a bajillion dollars,

421
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,921
Which is sad,
because he died broke.

422
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,156
Yes.

423
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,291
That --

424
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,593
You were right. Don't apologize.

425
00:18:01,627 --> 00:18:03,628
I'm not apologizing.
Apology accepted.

426
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:07,766
Luke, I-I really couldn't
be more proud of you,

427
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,901
And I am so sorry I didn't
give you more credit.

428
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:11,936
Thanks. Way to go, buddy.

429
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,741
I got to go finish the cupcakes.

430
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:18,176
no.

431
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,444
She didn't.

432
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:20,879
Sweetie, can you hand me those?

433
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:21,946
Uh-huh.

434
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,415
Yeah, I can talk.

435
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,084
What are you doing?!

436
00:18:26,118 --> 00:18:27,686
Well, I showed you
how to make them,

437
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,620
And now you can do it yourself.

438
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:32,757
Come on, guys, let's go.

439
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:37,128
Well, good, because
I really wanted to.

440
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:38,529
Okay.

441
00:18:38,564 --> 00:18:40,198
Setting the oven to 700!

442
00:18:40,232 --> 00:18:43,301
I'm putting the eggs in the bowl!

443
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:46,470
Oh, I got some shells
in them! Uh-oh!

444
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,806
Are you serious?!

445
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,112
Hey.

446
00:18:55,146 --> 00:18:56,747
Hey, mitchell.

447
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,116
So, I know you'd never, um...

448
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:02,953
I know you'd never -
never believe this

449
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:04,621
By looking at me right now,

450
00:19:04,656 --> 00:19:07,224
But, uh, I used to get
picked on at school, too.

451
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:09,059
So, jay told you?

452
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:12,596
Yeah. Yeah, they would,
um -- they'd call me weird.

453
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,198
<i>I was weird -- fun weird.</i>

454
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,501
But I -- this is the funny
thing about growing up.

455
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,770
For years and years,
everybody's desperately afraid

456
00:19:19,804 --> 00:19:21,605
To be different,
you know, in any way.

457
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:25,475
And then, suddenly,
almost overnight,

458
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,945
<i>Everybody wants to be different.</i>

459
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,083
And that is where we win.

460
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,252
I'm sort of counting on that.

461
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:38,755
I'm sorry I was picking on
you too much. No, it's --

462
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,257
Jay said that's what brothers do.

463
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,093
well, we don't have
to listen to him.

464
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,394
Brothers do that, too.

465
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:46,963
Okay, ladies,
finish up your tea party.

466
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,265
You're missing the show.

467
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,934
I can't believe I was
fighting over this guy, huh?

468
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,602
Check it out. Oh, whoa.

469
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:54,705
Check it out.

470
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:57,240
Wow. Awesome.

471
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:04,815
Why did he paint "starry night"?

472
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:07,084
Maybe 'cause the sky is beautiful

473
00:20:07,118 --> 00:20:09,386
And everybody likes looking at it.

474
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:14,024
And it reminds us that
something's up there,

475
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:16,126
Watching over all of us.

476
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,229
Aliens, who could
be here in a second

477
00:20:19,263 --> 00:20:22,065
To liquefy us and use us as fuel.

478
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,735
So, wake up, people. We're next.

479
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:26,770
Mom?

480
00:20:26,804 --> 00:20:27,953
You better get down here!

481
00:20:30,092 --> 00:20:31,793
Mmm! Oh, my god.

482
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:35,063
Whoa! Delicious. Haley: Uh-huh.

483
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,398
I am so proud.

484
00:20:36,432 --> 00:20:38,366
Oh, thanks, mom.
I'm just gonna wrap these up.

485
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:39,968
Oh, you know what, sweetie?
You're gonna be late for school.

486
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:41,536
Just go. I'll bring them by later.

487
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,206
Are you sure? I'm done? Yeah,
get out of here, betty crocker.

488
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,842
Okay. So proud of you!

489
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,178
Ugh! Do we still have the
number for poison control?

490
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,247
I love you, claire!
I've always loved you!

491
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:55,183
My mouth is asleep
like at the dentist.

492
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,685
Get over here, buddy.

493
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:02,789
