He's right.
It looked like a snake.

I can't believe my littlboy
is going into the fifth grade.

28
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:08,460
He used to hold my finger
with his little hand

29
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,628
And look at me
with those big eyes.

What are you
wearing there?

36
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:26,177
That looks like
an old christmas tree skirt.

37
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,279
It's a traditional
colombian poncho.

Why is our daughter
dressed like donna summer?

47

She is not donna summer.

48
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:55,039
Clearly, she's diana ross
from the rca years.

How is daddy
not seeing that?

And my new favorite model,

Of her dressed

00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:41,543
Yeah, I know.
That's why it's funny.

161
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:43,778
Moo!
I don't think it's as funny
as you think it is.

162
00:05:43,846 --> 00:05:45,747
Can we please just call
your sister?
No, no.

163
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:48,216
Cam, cam, why, so she
can be all judgmental
and condescending,

164
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,952
Like she's the expert
and I don't know how to
take care of a baby?

165
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,121
Mitchell,
she is your family.

166
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:56,891
Of course she's gonna be
judgmental and condescending.

167
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,393
Hello?

168
00:05:58,461 --> 00:05:59,728
Hey, hi.

169
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:01,496
Uh, not a big deal,
just wondering --

170
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:03,732
When your kids were small,
did you ever...

171
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:06,034
I don't know, uh,
smack their heads into a wall?

172
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,069
Usually,
we just gave time-outs.

173
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:09,237
No, no. Accidentally.

174
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,373
Um, we -- we just kind of
bonked lily's head,

175
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,341
And she --
it really wasn't very hard,

176
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,210
And she's not acting
any differently,

177
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:16,711
But I just worry --
relax.

178
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,079
It happens.

179
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:21,149
Luke used to bang his head
all the time, and he's fine.

180
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:22,684
Okay.
All right, thank you.

181
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:24,319
Thanks. That helps.
Okay, okay.

182
00:06:24,387 --> 00:06:26,054
We got to take her
to the doctor.

183
00:06:26,122 --> 00:06:27,455
Load up the car.

184
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:30,058
Jay: Gloria?

185
00:06:30,126 --> 00:06:31,993
I'm here.

186
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,163
I, uh, just dropped manny off
at school,

187
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:37,232
And I realized...

188
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,401
I just dropped manny off
at school.

189
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,769
Oh, boy.

190
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:43,638
And I was hoping we'd still have
a few more good years

191
00:06:43,706 --> 00:06:45,206
Before the mind
started to go.

192
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,574
No, what I'm saying...

193
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,544
We have the day to ourselves
for the first time in months.

194
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,279
We should
take advantage of it --

195
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:52,981
Go to the club...

196
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:54,749
Nice lunch...

197
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,084
Some massages.

198
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,452
What about work?

199
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,820
I'm the boss.

200
00:06:58,888 --> 00:07:02,624
Since I married you,
people are surprised
I come in at all.

201
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:03,692
[ chuckles ]

202
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,560
Jay's very spontaneous.

203
00:07:05,628 --> 00:07:09,097
He's always surprising me
with little presents,

204
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:10,398
Fun getaways.

205
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:12,434
I wasn't the greatest husband
the first time around,

206
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:14,502
But I'm trying to do better
this time.

207
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,806
And maybe by my third marriage,
I'll have it down pat.

208
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:19,007
[ chuckles ]

209
00:07:20,676 --> 00:07:23,278
Yeah, that one's
gonna cost me.

210
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,950
Whatcha reading there,
a book?

211
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,086
Yeah, I've been meaning
to get to it for a while.

212
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:32,754
Oh, it's got a map
at the beginning.

213
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:34,089
I like it
when books do that.

214
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:35,323
Uh-huh.

215
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:39,094
Do you have an open house
this morning?

216
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,095
I rescheduled.

217
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,164
Thought you might like
some company.

218
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,365
Ahh.

219
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,900
Phil: Well, the first day
of school can be tough

220
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,168
For stay-at-home moms.

221
00:07:47,236 --> 00:07:49,637
Now, you have to understand --
the kids are gone,

222
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:53,108
The nest is empty,
they are rudderless.

223
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:56,711
And a lot of guys
wouldn't even notice.

224
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,147
But I'm not a lot of guys.

225
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,716
I listen with my mind,
and if you pay attention,

226
00:08:01,784 --> 00:08:03,551
Women will tell you
what they want

227
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,954
By telling you the opposite
of what they want.

228
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,022
Like, the other day,
claire was like,

229
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,424
"you have to move your car.

230
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:12,160
There's no space in the garage
for both of our cars."

231
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,629
And what she's really saying
is that, you know,

232
00:08:14,697 --> 00:08:16,731
I should probably get
a sports car.

233
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,568
I was sort of looking forward
to a quiet day.

234
00:08:20,636 --> 00:08:23,371
Thought I'd just read,
maybe...Go for a run later.

235
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,606
That's it.

236
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:26,274
Great.
We'll run together.

237
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:29,043
You don't
have to do that.

238
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:30,278
Know.

239
00:08:34,984 --> 00:08:37,285
Listening.

240
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:39,420
The thing is,
I like to run alone,

241
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:42,123
And I run kind of fast,
so...

242
00:08:42,191 --> 00:08:43,091
So...

243
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,459
So, I'm not sure

244
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,528
You're gonna be able
to keep up with me.

245
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:48,196
[ laughs ]

246
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,665
You're k--
you're kidding, right?
No.

247
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,000
You really think
I can't keep up with you?

248
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,235
I'm not sure you can keep up
with this conversation.

249
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,337
I think you're forgetting
that I power-walk every morning

250
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:59,207
And that I wear my special ses
with the big soles,

251
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:01,810
Which were designed
by a doctor.

252
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:02,911
Yes, I know.

253
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,046
<i>But I run...
Every day.</i>

254
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:07,682
You really think you can run
as fast as me?

255
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,219
No, phil, I think I can run
much, much faster...

256
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:13,555
...Than you.

257
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,632
Boom.

258
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,901
Just like that,
the whole day changed.

259
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:27,969
It was game on.

260
00:09:28,037 --> 00:09:30,238
She knew it. I knew it.
We both knew it.

261
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:31,339
[ sighs ]

262
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,408
I just want to read.

263
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:34,910
I think I'll order
what I had the last time.

264
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:35,611
What was that called?

265
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,647
You just want me to
say it because you want
me to roll my r's.

266
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,115
Come on!
[ trilling ]
reuben.

267
00:09:40,183 --> 00:09:41,083
[ laughs ]

268
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,637
Jay, what is this?

269
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,272
Oh, looks like
my old car cover.

270
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,074
Don't give me that.
This is manny's poncho.

271
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,442
What is it doing here?

272
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,477
Maybe he decided to take it off
on the way to school.

273
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,212
What did you say to him?
Nothing.

274
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,914
I told some jokes.

275
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,249
<i>You said plenty
with your jokes.</i>

276
00:09:58,317 --> 00:09:59,884
Jay, he looks up to you.

277
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:01,653
He respects your opinion.

278
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,188
We dodged a bullet on this,
trust me.

279
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,856
I've been
down this road before.

280
00:10:04,924 --> 00:10:07,392
I remember one time
mitchell decided to wear

281
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,827
A jaunty scarf to school.

282
00:10:08,894 --> 00:10:10,128
I kept my mouth shut.

283
00:10:10,196 --> 00:10:11,830
He got
his jaunty butt kicked.

284
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:14,966
My dad has this perception that
I was very flamboyant as a kid,

285
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,701
Which is just --
it's nonsense,

286
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,337
Because I kept the whole
gay thing very under wraps.

287
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:21,973
You know,
I was just a guy's guy.

288
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,075
I-I was basically a jock.

289
00:10:24,143 --> 00:10:27,045
You know?

290
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:28,847
So, we should crush
manny's spirit

291
00:10:28,914 --> 00:10:31,382
And destroy everything
that makes him who he is.

292
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,184
I'm just sing,
it's no fun

293
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:35,353
To see your kid
get picked on every day,

294
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:37,455
Getting tormented
just because he's different.

295
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,624
Now, I'm telling you,
it rips your heart out.

296
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:43,027
Well, batman doesn't get
picked on, and he wears a cape.

297
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:46,297
A poncho is just a cape
that goes all the way around.

298
00:10:46,365 --> 00:10:49,434
Batman doesn't get picked on
because he's a muscular genius.

299
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,536
Manny can't make it
to the top bunk.

300
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:53,438
We're taking this poncho
to manny at school.

301
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:56,174
It's important that he knows
that we support m.

302
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:00,478
And then we go get
those massages.

303
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:02,347
That sounded good.

304
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:08,086
I always take the stairs
two at a time.

305
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:09,921
I don't even think about it
anymore.

306
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:11,823
The regular way
would seem weird.

307
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,858
Phil, let it go.
I'm faster than you.

308
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:16,227
If only there was some way
we could settle this

309
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:19,497
Once and for all,
but how?

310
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,199
Huh.

311
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,134
You seriously
want to race me?

312
00:11:23,202 --> 00:11:25,203
I ran a half marathon
last year.

313
00:11:25,271 --> 00:11:27,272
Wow. I'm half scared.

314
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:28,540
<i>Okay,
we do need to do this.</i>

315
00:11:28,607 --> 00:11:29,741
I'll go change.

316
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:31,409
Not now.
I got a conference call.

317
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,710
But how about after that?

318
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:33,945
Great. This afternoon.

319
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:36,414
Sweet!

320
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:38,650
Two at a time,
two at a time, two at a --

321
00:11:38,717 --> 00:11:40,718
Son of a gun,
got to fix that step.

322
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,987
Two at a time,
already at the top, so...

323
00:11:44,323 --> 00:11:46,791
Hi.
I'm dr. Miura.

324
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:48,159
I'm on call today.

325
00:11:48,227 --> 00:11:49,928
Looks like we have
a little head bump.

326
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,931
Yeah, it happened a couple hours
ago on a doorjamb.

327
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:54,432
Oh, ouch.

328
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,867
We used to do this thing
in school

329
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,502
Where they would give you
an egg,

330
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,671
And you -- you know,
you couldn't break it.

331
00:11:59,738 --> 00:12:02,574
And it was supposed to teach you
how hard it was to be a parent.

332
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:03,875
But...

333
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:07,512
The real thing, it's --
it's -- it's so much harder.

334
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,747
We did that
in my school, too.

335
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,616
It didn't turn out
so well.

336
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,484
Went through a dozen eggs.

337
00:12:13,552 --> 00:12:15,453
Yeah, well,
he's a nervous eater.

338
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:17,622
<i>No, I broke
a dozen eggs.
Oh.</i>

339
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,259
I'm sorry.
I just assumed that --

340
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:22,493
I know.

341
00:12:22,561 --> 00:12:24,629
I know
what you assumed.

342
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:28,132
There doesn't seem to be
any mark.

343
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,668
Well, her head was...
Somewhat protected.

344
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:31,702
Protected?

345
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,304
Was she wearing
a hat?

346
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:34,805
Yes, yes.
It was like a hat.

347
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:36,073
It was a wig.

348
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,943
Actually, sort of
a ghetto-fabulous afro thing.

349
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:40,978
I thought it might be
medically relevant.

350
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:41,413
Really?

351
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:44,283
You thought "ghetto-fabulous"
might be medically relevant?

352
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,418
Maybe I should just finish
with the exam?

353
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:47,586
Yes. Thanks.

354
00:12:47,654 --> 00:12:49,054
You'll be pleased to know

355
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,657
That mitchell and I
intend on raising lily

356
00:12:51,724 --> 00:12:54,092
With influences
from her asian heritage.

357
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,895
That is fantastic.

358
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:59,564
Have you noticed any vomiting
since the head bump?

359
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,765
Uh, no. No, no.

360
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,834
We've hung some art in her room,
some asian art,

361
00:13:02,902 --> 00:13:05,069
And then when she's ready
for solid food,

362
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:06,838
There is a fantastic
pho place

363
00:13:06,906 --> 00:13:08,973
Right around the corner
from our house.

364
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,009
Am I pronouncing that
right?

365
00:13:11,076 --> 00:13:13,344
Is it "pho"?
[fuh]

366
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,779
It's a soup.

367
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,514
I don't know.

368
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,449
I'm from denver.

369
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:22,287
We don't have
a lot of...Pho there.

370
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,322
Just to be sure,

371
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,358
Could you show me
how hard lily got hit?

372
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:28,993
And u-- use your head.

373
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,930
Oh, yeah, so, I mean,
really, it was...

374
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,532
It was just
sort of like, um...

375
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,634
Could I see that
again?

376
00:13:36,702 --> 00:13:39,704
Um, it was just --
just a head bump, you know?

377
00:13:39,772 --> 00:13:41,339
How are you feeling?

378
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,607
Uh, fine.

379
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,808
So is lily.

380
00:13:44,276 --> 00:13:46,944
Babies are designed
to survive new parents.

381
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:49,747
So stop worrying.
You guys are doing great.

382
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:51,615
Thank you.

383
00:13:53,552 --> 00:13:55,386
Denver.

384
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,143
I don't see any ponchos,

385
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,312
Which means either the kids
don't wear them

386
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,214
<i>Or the ones who do wear them
disappear.</i>

387
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,716
We're doing
the right thing.

388
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,551
I support manny
no matter what.

389
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,053
Children need to know
that you believe in them.

390
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,855
It's the most
important thing.

391
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:18,790
If you tell them
they have wings,

392
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,592
They will believe
they can fly.

393
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,760
Oh, really?

394
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,162
I had a buddy
went to woodstock,

395
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,698
Believed he could fly --
didn't end great.

396
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:29,568
It's why hotel windows
don't open anymore.

397
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,372
Is something wrong?
Who's died?

398
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,473
No one, manny.

399
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,108
Why would you even
think that?

400
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:39,044
In colombia, manny went to
pablo escobar elementary school.

401
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:40,946
If you were
pulled out of class,

402
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,981
It was definitely
to identify a body.

403
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,316
Well, we got
your poncho here.

404
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,951
I thought you said
it made me look like

405
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,219
My neck
was wearing a dress.

406
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:48,253
That was a joke.

407
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,554
Oh, good
it's still in the pocket.

408
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,989
What do you got there,
buddy?

409
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,124
My pan flute.

410
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,725
I'm going to play
some colombian folk music

411
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:54,793
For my new classmates.

412
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,961
Huh. Great.

413
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,298
I've never been
more proud of you.

414
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,933
I'm sure your friends
are gonna love it.

415
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,535
Break the flute.
What?

416
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,971
The poncho by itself
is fine.

417
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,675
The poncho plus the flute
plus the stupid dance --

418
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,144
My son will die a virgin.

419
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,612
That's right.

420
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,748
Hey, sport, can I take a look
at that whistle?

421
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,318
Oh, geez,
look at that!

422
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,520
And now you stepped
on it!
What?

423
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,357
Oh, darn!
Wh-what's wrong with me?!

424
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,126
Here, let me get it.

425
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:29,361
Thank you.

426
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,496
You know what, actually,
maybe you should do this.

427
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,465
Why?
I-I don't want to
bump her head against the door,

428
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,200
You know,
pinch her with the seat belt.

429
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,003
Mitchell, how long are
you gonna beat yourself
up over one mistake?

430
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,272
Is this gonna be like the bld
highlights all over again?

431
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,273
I just...

432
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,275
I think I suck
at being a father.

433
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:44,910
What are you
talking about?

434
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,044
We're new at this.

435
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,512
Yeah, but you're such
a natural.

436
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,613
I mean, look at you.

437
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,248
You walk into the room,
and she lights up.

438
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,184
You -- you change her diaper
with one hand.

439
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,385
I -- nice.

440
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,153
I'm actually jealous
of you.

441
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,056
There are so many things
that you do that I can't.

442
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,492
You -- you baby-proofed
the entire house.

443
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,861
You took care of all
the adoption paperwork.

444
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,097
Without you, we wouldn't even
have a baby to injure.

445
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,198
Just a couple of forms.

446
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,033
Actually,
that was a lot of paperwork.

447
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,402
And you got her on all those
preschool waiting lists.

448
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,071
<i>I can't believe you
were gonna wait until
she was old enough.</i>

449
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,440
You see, that's what makes us
a great team.

450
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,275
We each have
our own strengths.

451
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,944
Now...

452
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:20,545
Who are
amazing parents?

453
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,147
We are.
I can't hear you.

454
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,281
We are!

455
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,550
Don't you forget it.
Okay.

456
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:30,355
Did we just lock our baby
in the car?

457
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,656
Did you put the keys
in the bag?!

458
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,425
I put the keys in the bag.
That's what we always --

459
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,327
Oh, mitchell, I told you not to
put the keys in the bag!

460
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,795
Don't freak out.
Come on, don't freak out!

461
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,029
Lily, it's okay!

462
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:38,997
* a, b, c, d,
e, f, g *

463
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,632
What,
are you singing to her?

464
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,601
People get arrested
for this, mitchell!
We have to keep her calm.

465
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,837
* h, I, j, k,
l, m, n, o, p *

466
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,106
Do all four doors lock?!
Do you have a phone?!

467
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,609
[ dance music playing ]
what?

468
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,877
I didn't say anything.

469
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:54,112
I couldn't hear you.
I'm cranking one of my mash-ups.

470
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,614
Oh.

471
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,815
Hey, hey!

472
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:57,983
There they are.

473
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,585
How was the first day
back in prison?

474

Are you?
I was born ready.

It's just --

You're getting better,

Maybe.

such a tough job...
