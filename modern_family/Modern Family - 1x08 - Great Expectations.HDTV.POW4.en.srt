1
00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:04,568
Fix that step.

2
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,322
Morning.

3
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:13,362
I'm still sleeping.

4
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:15,522
Happy anniversary.

5
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,054
And they said we wouldn't last.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,260
Who said that?

7
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,400
- Oh, look at you. You're cute.
- Go ahead. Open it.

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,506
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

9
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,218
Something, nothing.

10
00:00:27,963 --> 00:00:30,313
- It's a View-Master.
- Look inside.

11
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,538
Oh, it's us.

12
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,797
Look at how young we are.

13
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,122
Oh, God, that perm.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,297
Yeah, it really framed my face.

15
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,907
Why is there a picture
of a bracelet?

16
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,297
Must be some kind of a mistake.
What the heck is that?

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,322
- Oh, Phil, you didn't.
- What? Did he? Did he?

18
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:52,296
It's beautiful.

19
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:55,511
Oh, sweetie, I love it.
Okay, your turn.

20
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:58,436
- My turn? Where is it?
- It's on the bureau.

21
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,685
I'm surprised I didn't see it.

22
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,128
Where?

23
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:04,953
There, the red envelope.

24
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:09,151
- It's a... card.
- That's where you're wrong.

25
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:12,947
I am so excited.

26
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:16,913
Coupons for...

27
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:20,380
Five... free... hugs.

28
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,143
- You don't like it?
- Are you kidding me? I love it.

29
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:26,460
It's so creative. Coupons for hugs,
which are usually free,

30
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,838
but this makes it official,
which is so great.

31
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,301
I was so proud of myself
when I thought of it

32
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,175
because you're
impossible to buy for.

33
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:35,324
You never want anything.

34
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,778
Things I want...
Robot dog, night-vision goggles,

35
00:01:39,903 --> 00:01:41,503
bug vacuum, GPS watch,

36
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,546
speakers that look like rocks.

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,781
I love my wife,
but she sucks at giving gifts.

38
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,056
I'm sorry for
the pay-channel language, but...

39
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,613
Yogurt maker.
I can't not think of things I want.

40

42
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:07,163
- Can't tell if she needs a new diaper.
- I think we'd be able to tell.

43
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:09,709
With these diapers, it's hard to tell.
Triple leakage protection.

44
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:12,002
Leaklock... contours
to protect her little body.

45
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,824
No gapping or chapping.

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,135
Do you think that maybe we need a...

47
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,825
Night out? Yes.

48
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,260
Just a few hours
with a couple of adults,

49
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:22,574
a few drinks, no baby talk.

50
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,782
- It'll make us better parents.
- Stop drilling. You've struck oil.

51
00:02:25,907 --> 00:02:27,967
We'll get Gloria to babysit.
We're going out.

52
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:29,601
- You got some spittle.
- Do I?

53
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:32,026
You know who'd be fun to call?
Sal.

54
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:34,774
Raise the roof, Lily.

55
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,972
We're calling Sal.

56
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,403
Sal is our very best friend
in the whole wide world.

57
00:02:40,675 --> 00:02:44,372
The reason we love her so much
is she has absolutely no inhibitions.

58
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,958
And that's before she starts drinking.
Hanging out with her

59
00:02:47,126 --> 00:02:49,598
is like an Amsterdam Saturday night
every day of the week.

60
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:51,466
And, ironically,

61
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,142
Sal's not allowed
back into Amsterdam.

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,633
Anyday of the week.

63
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:58,427
Of course we would love
to have the baby.

64
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,850
All the other cousins
are sleeping over tonight.

65
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:02,575
The more, the merrier.

66
00:03:03,213 --> 00:03:04,557
See you tonight.
Bye-bye.

67
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,599
Is Haley still coming?

68
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:07,853
You're related.

69
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,325
I will spray you with the hose.

70
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,569
All the grandkids are coming over
for "Jay's night." Family tradition.

71
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,188
Everybody wears PJ's,
which they love.

72
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:21,155
I make my famous Sloppy Jays,
which are really Sloppy Joes,

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,430
but made by Jay, which they love.

74
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:27,783
And then we watch a western together,
which they don't care for, but, hey,

75
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,083
it's "Jay's night."

76
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,044
So, Mom, there's a party
tonight at Andrew Adler's,

77
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:34,025
and everybody's gonna be there.

78
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,213
That sounds like so much fun,
but I have other plans.

79
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:39,719
That's high-larious,
but I'm talking about me.

80
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,939
That's unusual.

81
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:42,930
You said you'd go
to your grandfather's.

82
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,300
That's what's so perfect about this.

83
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,310
Andrew lives a couple blocks away
from Grandpa, so I figured...

84
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,021
Sweetie, you made a commitment.

85
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:53,665
But I really want to go. And plus,
every time I go over to Grandpa's,

86
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,860
Manny just stares at me
the whole time.

87
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,653
Maybe if you wore a bra.

88
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:00,853
What?
I can't wait to go to Grandpa's.

89
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:03,455
Family means everything to me.

90
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,411
Because you have no friends.

91
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,952
Because I love Grandpa,
and he's getting older.

92
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,192
Who knows how many years
he has left?

93
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:15,055
- Is Grandpa dying?
- Didn't they tell you?

94
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:16,920
Stop torturing your brother.

95
00:04:17,045 --> 00:04:18,995
No, your grandfather is fine.

96
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:21,298
For now.

97
00:04:23,957 --> 00:04:25,357
Who could that be?

98
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,500
You expecting someone special?

99
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,210
Thank you.

100
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:36,609
Flowers, too?

101
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:39,685
- I'm sorry.
- What are you apologizing for?

102
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,657
- They're gorgeous.
- It's too much, you know.

103
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:46,160
With the View-Master and the bracelet
and the flowers and the balloons.

104
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:48,329
- Balloons?
- They're attached to your car.

105
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:52,875
I just don't want you to feel bad
about your little... coupons.

106
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:56,337
Wait. You thought the coupons
were your only present?

107
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:58,464
- Are you kidding me?
- They aren't?

108
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,277
Phil, come on.
It's our anniversary.

109
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,772
Those coupons were just like a fun,
little way to kick off the day.

110
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:09,392
Your real present is coming tonight,
and you're gonna love it.

111
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:10,814
Love it!

112
00:05:11,293 --> 00:05:12,293
Cool!

113
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:14,765
I got nothing.

114
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:16,976
I'm so screwed.

115
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:21,821
This place brings back
so many memories.

116
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:26,243
Get in here!

117
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,555
Big bear!

118
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:29,918
And my baby cub!

119
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,864
- Oh, my God! You guys!
- Look at you!

120
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,708
You notice anything different?

121
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,712
- Your hair's longer, right?
- Did you get your teeth bleached?

122
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:40,631
Let me give you a little hint.
Ba-boobs!

123
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,305
- Oh, my God!
- Those are sensational!

124
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,630
I know. Right?

125
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:47,385
- You want to touch 'em?
- I'm gay, not dead.

126
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,727
Are you okay with this?

127
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:50,879
Yeah, you're drinking
a passion-fruit daiquiri.

128
00:05:51,004 --> 00:05:53,404
- Get in there good.
- I'm coming in!

129
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:04,822
So, Lily likes that... singing?

130
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:06,698
Yes. It relaxes her.

131
00:06:13,764 --> 00:06:15,014
So Lily's deaf.

132
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,781
There are my little stinkers!

133
00:06:19,906 --> 00:06:21,815
- Hi, grandpa.
- Come on in.

134
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,481
- Well, hello, there, Haley.
- Take it down a notch, Jethro.

135
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:30,722
So, you guys ready for some fun?

136
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:32,642
What?

137
00:06:33,892 --> 00:06:36,562
I love you, Grandpa,
and I'm never gonna forget you.

138
00:06:36,843 --> 00:06:38,189
Back at you, champ.

139
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,355
This is a pajama party.
Where's your PJ's?

140
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,665
They're in my bag.
I need to talk to you about something.

141
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,779
She wants to go to a party
with Dylan, Grandpa.

142
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:47,031
Shut up, Alex!

143
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:50,952
It's at my friend Andrew Adler's.
He lives three blocks from here.

144
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:52,490
Oh, walking distance.

145
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,414
Right. So I wouldn't ask you this,
because I love

146
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,376
coming to your house, but
it's kind of an important party...

147
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,544
If somebody invites you over, the last
thing you want to do is insult them.

148
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,814
- Exactly!
- I'm glad we agree.

149
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,670
Oh, my God, that was so easy.
This is awesome.

150
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,563
You really don't understand
what just happened there, do you?

151
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:13,120
PJ's on, Haley!

152
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,567
What?

153
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,228
I would be happy
to let her change in my room.

154
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,476
Who could that be?

155
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:27,655
Are you expecting someone special?

156
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,689
What did you do?

157
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,582
Nothing. I just know that
there's someone at the door.

158
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:41,533
Rock on, Phil Dunphy.

159
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,049
Read it and weep, Phil!

160
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:46,882
It's the Iz!

161
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:49,051
Who?

162
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:51,785
Izzy Lafontaine from Spandau Ballet.

163
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,757
Izzy Fontaine from Pa...

164
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,516
He's got it now.

165
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,144
He's got it.
He's just seriously freaking out.

166
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:00,810
Phil loves Spandau Ballet.

167
00:08:00,935 --> 00:08:03,940
That song "True" was playing
in the car the first time we kissed.

168
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,414
It's our song.

169
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,088
So I did some research,
found out that the lead guitarist

170
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:10,213
lives like 40 miles from here.

171
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,798
He was in the phone book.
How '80s is that?

172
00:08:13,774 --> 00:08:15,338
I never liked Spandau Ballet.

173
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,931
Our entire marriage,
I never once mentioned Spandau Ballet.

174
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:19,779
Am I even pronouncing that right?

175
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:23,267
Here to play
a private concert for us

176
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:25,743
- is the guitarist...
- Bass player, actually.

177
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,836
- ... and lead singer...
- Backup. Backup.

178
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,094
... of Spandau Ballet.

179
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:31,038
Between Richard Miller
and Martin Kemp.

180
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,345
Oh, those guys.

181
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:38,307
I miss you two guys so much.

182
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,695
So, so much.

183
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,604
- To us!
- Yeah, to us!

184
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,629
To us, the three musketeers!

185
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:47,812
- Cabo!
- What?

186
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:50,316
Seriously, you bastards,
we've been talking about it forever.

187
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:53,074
We're doing it! We're going to Cabo!
Let's do it! Let's do it!

188
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,257
- All right, let's go!
- Yes. That will be fun.

189
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,804
"Fun"? Are you joking?

190
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:00,456
Margaritas, you guys, these guys.

191
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:04,024
- It's gonna be epic!
- We need to find someone for Lily.

192
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,756
How much are you gonna pay me
to go make out with the waitress?

193
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,592
Wait. Which one?
The old one or the young one?

194
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:14,535
$10 for the young one,
$20 for the old.

195
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,638
I am about to make 30 bucks.

196
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,020
- I'm just gonna go check on Lily.
- Right now?

197
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,115
- It'll just take a second.
- Well, I'm just...

198
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,770
You're gonna miss me sluttin' it up
with Driving Miss Daisy.

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,735
- It'll just take a second.
- Real fast.

200
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,660
You should kill that baby.

201
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,694
What?

202
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,113
You should call the baby.

203
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:34,502
I love you guys so much!

204
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:37,964
- Did she just...
- I'm scared.

205
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:42,005
- I got nothing.
- I think I have a very good pair.

206
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,958
- You sure do.
- And I got squat.

207
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:46,698
I don't think I have
anything, either.

208
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,754
Are you kidding me?
That's a straight.

209
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,382
- Really?
- She wins.

210
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:53,072
- You won!
- I win.

211
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,216
You know what?
I think I deserve a soda.

212
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,625
- Good job, Haley.
- I don't know how to play.

213
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:07,027
Hi, honey.

214
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,578
- Gee, you scared me.
- How did you...

215
00:10:09,703 --> 00:10:13,160
Light bulb went out. You don't change
right away, you never get around to it.

216
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,285
There.

217
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:17,479
Now I can see everything
that goes on around here.

218
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,158
I've had a little practice at this.

219
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,773
Haley wasn't throwing anything at me
I hadn't seen before

220
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,898
from her mother and then some.

221
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:27,543
But nobody gets off the rock.

222
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,862
Right, here's a track.
Wasn't so popular in America.

223
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:33,381
Got to number six
on the Netherlands' charts, though.

224
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,177
That whole summer, I couldn't
walk to the corner in Amsterdam

225
00:10:36,346 --> 00:10:39,013
without mobs of birds coming up
and asking me for the double bubble.

226
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:41,382
Okay, just play it, I think. Yeah.

227
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,579
He's awesome, honey.

228
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:45,895
- You're welcome.
- <i>Tonight</i>

229
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,816
<i>So right</i>

230
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:49,769
<i>So right</i>

231
00:10:50,455 --> 00:10:51,400
<i>Lover</i>

232
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,903
Hey, Phil, I think your lover
wants a kiss from you.

233
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:59,784
Come on, man. She's not your sister.
Give her a proper snog.

234
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,706
That's a bad joke. Not funny.

235
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:09,710
My sister lost her feet
to complications from diabetes.

236
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:12,945
Can I get you some water,
there, guy, or...

237
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,423
You got tea?

238
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,800
- Yes, of course. I'll get that.
- Yeah, chamomile.

239
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,130
You don't miss a minute.

240
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,411
Oh, God. Why did...

241
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:26,309
Look at what I'm doing. I'm making it
all about me. What a downer.

242
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:29,897
It's your evening. Let's make it great.
Name your playlist. I'll do it all.

243
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:32,566
Just the classics.
Let's play the hits.

244
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:36,529
We'll get to the hits, obviously.
Go to the back catalog. Favorite B-side.

245
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,132
That's fun! Yeah, that's fun.

246
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,992
- Just... I'm so bad with titles.
- Hum it.

247
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:46,747
Just did that one, didn't I?

248
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,477
That's right. It's in the noodle.
So, I guess...

249
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,255
What album is that on?

250
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,758
- Second. I want to say second.
- What's on the cover?

251
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:01,770
There's a warlock, I think.
Or a seascape.

252
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,216
- Oh, "Millennium Sunrise"?
- "Millennium Sunrise."

253
00:12:04,341 --> 00:12:07,476
There is no "Millennium Sunrise" record.
What? What?

254
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,896
You're not a fan-dau. You didn't
even know who I was at the door.

255
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,898
I saw it in your eyes.
Am I being Punk'd?

256
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,151
This means so much to Claire.
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

257
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,133
Her feelings?
Well, what about my feelings?

258
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:19,506
This is my career, man.

259
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,044
My music was
the soundtrack to people's lives.

260
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,199
Now I'm nothing.
How do you think that feels?

261
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:25,870
This is really humiliating.

262
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,488
Don't go. Don't go!

263
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:30,263
What are you guys doing?

264
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:32,402
He let me touch it.

265
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,514
I think she said "kill," Cam. I do.

266
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,114
Maybe it was just a joke.
She's always had a dark sense of humor.

267
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,134
That's true.
Remember her Halloween costume?

268
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,325
When she came as Siegfried
and part of Roy?

269
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:43,737
It was too soon.

270
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,625
This was just a joke.

271
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,518
Here she comes. I'm gonna bring up Lily.
We'll see what she says.

272
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,729
- Show her some pictures.
- Pay up, bitches!

273
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,483
- More drinks.
- Free drinks!

274
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,007
- You've got to look at these pictures.
- What are they of?

275
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:01,656
- It's Lily at the zoo.
- Oh, cute.

276
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:05,357
- Look at that one.
- Cute, cutie cute, cute, et cetera.

277
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,453
So, you guys are gonna
have to bring Lily

278
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:10,498
to Cabo, now that you're the guys
that always bring Lily.

279
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,000
- Well, you know... probably.
- Yeah, probably.

280
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,710
I will throw her in the ocean.

281
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:16,796
- What?
- I said I got to go pee.

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,091
- Okay, that wasn't even close.
- Nope.

283
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:23,669
I mean, what do we do?
Do we say something?

284
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,471
How do we even bring it up?

285
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,349
She threatened our child,
and that's your concern, a segue?

286
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,035
- You know what this is?
- What?

287
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,937
This is first-child syndrome.

288
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,418
It's where the first child is happy,
and then the second child comes along,

289
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:40,945
and the first child gets jealous of
the second child and starts acting out.

290
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:43,807
Yes, that's brilliant,
except Sal's not our child.

291
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:47,104
Well, think about it. We've practically
done everything for her.

292
00:13:47,229 --> 00:13:50,955
We've held her when she's cried. We've
carried her when she couldn't walk.

293
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,950
We've done everything
but potty-train her.

294
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,363
I was thinking...

295
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,422
- Oh, sorry.
- ... that when we go to Cabo,

296
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:02,279
we have find a hotel
with a swim-up bar

297
00:14:02,431 --> 00:14:05,552
'cause this going back and forth
to the bathroom is a fool's game.

298
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:08,559
- Okay, let's get more drinks.
- Sal, Sal, we got to talk.

299
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:11,267
- It's about Lily.
- Oh, shocker.

300
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:15,771
Do you think it's at all possible
that maybe you're jealous of her?

301
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,188
What?!

302
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:19,743
- It's just... I don't know.
- What?!

303
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:21,695
Why would you say that?

304
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,749
You won't look
at any pictures of her,

305
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:26,388
and you talked about killing her
and throwing her in the ocean.

306
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,368
That was a joke.
You guys, come on! We're fine.

307
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,183
Show me the pictures of Yoko.

308
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,330
- See?
- Okay, it's a joke.

309
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,374
You guys, come on! Because she's Asian
and she broke up our group.

310
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:40,671
I just... Let's at least acknowledge
that things have changed between us.

311
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,091
And you know what? Because Lily's here
doesn't mean we love you any less.

312
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,343
No, absolutely not.

313
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:49,029
We used to be really close,
and you used to call me a lot.

314
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,471
- And now you never call me.
- Well, but we...

315
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,834
And last week,
I had a really bad dream,

316
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,867
and I was thinking,
"Okay, I'm gonna call them,"

317
00:14:57,992 --> 00:15:01,413
and then I thought, "Oh, no!
You can't call them because

318
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:04,278
"you might wake up their baby!"

319
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,547
- You can always call.
- Oh, honey, always call us.

320
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:10,618
I'm sorry we haven't been there.
We're here now, okay?

321
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,876
- Feel better?
- I think you just put a little spittle.

322
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:27,322
- Did she just fall asleep?
- I wish Lily would do the same.

323
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,303
Give her eight shots of tequila.

324
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:38,187
I don't understand
why she's not falling asleep.

325
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,439
- I have a theory.
- I got the movie.

326
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,343
Manny, why don't you go
fire up some popcorn?

327
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:48,521
You looking for these?

328
00:15:49,242 --> 00:15:51,701
- You took my shoes?
- No, I took your freedom.

329
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,201
Sorry, it ain't your night.

330
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,923
Why are you being like this?

331
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,707
I just wanted to go
to that party for like two hours.

332
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,989
I would have been back by now!
Would that have killed you?!

333
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:03,115
She's just like her mother.

334
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,053
Why are you treating Haley
like this?

335
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,619
Me? She's the one
acting like a pill.

336
00:16:07,744 --> 00:16:09,427
You're taking this too personally.

337
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:12,232
When I was Haley's age,
I loved my grandfather,

338
00:16:12,357 --> 00:16:14,805
but I still wanted to go
to parties and be with boys.

339
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,076
I know, I know, so did Claire...

340
00:16:17,469 --> 00:16:19,560
and Mitchell.
But you know what?

341
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,856
You try to put something over on me,
you're gonna lose.

342
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,566
So what? Now you're gonna make
this into a big game?

343
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:28,426
I'm trying to keep them around
a little bit longer, that's all.

344
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:31,847
Who knows how many
nights like this I got left?

345
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:37,288
- I miss you already!
- What's wrong with this kid tonight?

346
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:41,063
Go in the kitchen and help out the guys,
and I'll be right in.

347
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:45,270
It's great that you want to spend time
with your granddaughter,

348
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,048
but is this really the way?

349
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:49,077
Fine.

350
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:51,626
You're a good <i>abuelo</i>.

351
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,737
- She's upstairs.
- I know.

352
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:02,771
Get up.

353
00:17:04,014 --> 00:17:06,233
You're here to take Haley
to the party, right?

354
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,325
She's in the house.

355
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:12,849
How did you know I was here?

356
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,720
This is how I first met Phil.

357
00:17:19,198 --> 00:17:21,290
Thanks again, Grandpa.
We'll be back by 11:00.

358
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:23,769
- I will track you down.
- I believe that.

359
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:26,108
- What's that smell?
- Sloppy Jays.

360
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,533
Help yourself.
There's plenty left.

361
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:31,082
Sloppy Jays because your name's Jay.

362
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:32,884
Right on.

363
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:35,763
I can't believe she's into this guy.

364
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,640
If you want, I'll fix you a plate.

365
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:40,601
- Yeah, definitely. That'd be great.
- What about the party?

366
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,948
We can go in just a minute.
Just let...

367
00:17:43,073 --> 00:17:44,123
Oh, no way!

368
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,649
"The Gunfighter"!
I love this movie!

369
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:48,476
Dylan, the party.

370
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:49,869
Oh, but...

371
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:51,696
cowboys.

372
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,365
Don't fight it, Haley.
They never grow up.

373
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,848
I'm going to the kitchen
for an espresso.

374
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,288
Anybody need anything?

375
00:17:58,413 --> 00:17:59,369
No, thanks.

376
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,974
2, 3, 4.

377
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,610
"The year was 1991.

378
00:18:09,998 --> 00:18:12,382
"America was immersed
in Desert Storm."

379
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:19,024
"Meanwhile, stateside,
another storm was brewing...

380
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:20,585
"in my heart."

381
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,635
This is stupid, isn't it?

382
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,061
Is it stupid, Phil?

383
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:28,857
Just keep going, Claire.
It's wonderful.

384
00:18:31,492 --> 00:18:34,025
"After a romantic dinner
at Fratelli's,

385
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,046
"a certain nervous young couple
shared their first kiss

386
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:40,556
"as the radio played this song."

387
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:06,771
You know what?
No, no. Sorry.

388
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,147
- Sorry. Not gonna do it, no.
- What's wrong?

389
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:11,733
- What's going on?
- Do you know the name of this song?

390
00:19:13,573 --> 00:19:16,233
- Right. "True."
- "True", of course.

391
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,867
This is false. I'm not gonna play "True"
for someone who's false.

392
00:19:20,036 --> 00:19:23,064
He doesn't even know the band.
He's not a fan.

393
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:25,158
Of course he does.
Because this is our song.

394
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,683
You love this song.
Tell him this is our song.

395
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,463
- Tell him, Phil.
- It's not our song, Claire.

396
00:19:30,588 --> 00:19:34,338
Our song is "If You Leave"
by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

397
00:19:34,463 --> 00:19:35,399
Are you sure?

398
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:36,693
Pretty sure.

399
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,261
I sang it at our wedding.

400
00:19:38,712 --> 00:19:41,464
- Oh, I'm an idiot.
- Well, actually, he's the idiot.

401
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:43,140
He fell in love to a breakup song.

402
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:44,906
Ignore him. This is beautiful.

403
00:19:45,031 --> 00:19:47,019
- I love it.
- I hate this. I hate this.

404
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,178
You're so sweet and nice,

405
00:19:49,303 --> 00:19:51,899
and I can't even give you
a decent anniversary present.

406
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:55,229
I love you so much, and I feel like
you just are never gonna know it.

407
00:19:55,405 --> 00:19:57,186
- I know it.
- You do know it?

408
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,822
I know it. Yes.

409
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:02,285
- You do?
- And this is an awesome gift.

410
00:20:02,454 --> 00:20:04,254
- Do you know why?
- Why?

411
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,303
You just gave us a new song.

412
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,333
Suppose it's all
brought you back together, eh?

413
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,043
Sort of.

414
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:13,324
Rekindled fires of a dying passion?

415
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,249
Sure.

416
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:17,766
Shot a ray of hope
into this gloomy suburban life?

417
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,350
- All right, buddy.
- Maybe you could just play it, Izzy.

418
00:20:21,475 --> 00:20:22,775
For you, Claire.

419
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:51,403
- She is so sweet.
- Isn't she?

420
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:53,028
Like a little angel.

421
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,004
Let me hold her.

422
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:01,824
Oh, thank God.
