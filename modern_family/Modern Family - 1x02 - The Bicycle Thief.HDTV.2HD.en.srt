1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,800
What's the key to being a great dad?

2
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:09,436
That's a tough one.

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:14,441
Giving them the freedom to be
whatever they want to be...
Right, exactly, and --

4
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:15,776
...Wha pilot, a president...
Me

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:17,578
And for us,
what we're gonna --

6
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:20,414
...Of a company
or of a country.

7
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:24,518
Patience.

8
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,488
Well, be their buddy.

9
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:29,056
That's your answer?

10
00:00:29,124 --> 00:00:31,024
And stay in school.
No.

11
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,326
And don't do drugs.
No!

12
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:33,694
Just give me the answer.

13
00:00:33,762 --> 00:00:34,995
Oh, god.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,667
Still thinking.

16
00:00:58,119 --> 00:00:59,653
Hey.
Hey.

17
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:00,654
Hi.

18
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:01,855
Oh, okay.

19
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,457
Hi, um...

20
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,359
This is my husband,
phil.
Hi.

21
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:07,928
And that's my son, luke,
right there.

22
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:09,229
This is...
Desiree.

23
00:01:09,297 --> 00:01:10,798
Desiree -- right.
Sorry.

24
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:13,333
Desiree just moved in
down the block.

25
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,668
Fun. Where?
314.

26
00:01:14,736 --> 00:01:16,670
Oh,
the two-bedroom cottage

27
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:18,605
With the indoor/outdoor
family room.

28
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:20,274
Very good.
How did you --

29
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,775
Bet you're loving
that steam shower.

30
00:01:21,843 --> 00:01:23,777
Phil, that's creepy.
Oh, sorry.

31
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,079
[ laughs ]
I'm a real-estate mogul.

32
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:28,449
What?! No, I am
a real-estate agent.

33
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:30,017
Um, we caravanned
that house.

34
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:31,185
Great, uh, deck.

35
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,319
Thanks.

36
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,588
I'm just there
till my divorce is final.

37
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:36,924
Now, who is coconuts enough
to dorce you?

38
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,393
We got to go,
but we'll see yoaround.

39
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:41,662
Well, we'll have to
have you over sometime.

40
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,397
I'd love it.
All right.

41
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:45,365
Bye.
Bye.

42
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:46,366
She's awesome.

43
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:47,968
No, we are never
having her over.

44
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:50,838
I heard she already slept
with two dads from the school.

45
00:01:50,905 --> 00:01:52,005
What?
Mm-hmm.

46
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:54,107
That's...Horrible.

47
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:55,476
Luke: Dad!
Watch out.

48
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:57,244
Oh,
watch it, buddy.

49
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:58,412
Grandma.

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,546
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:59,614 --> 00:02:01,315
That still looks like
a girl's bike.

52
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:03,083
Well, we'll add
more black tape.

53
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:06,753
Phil: My son has been riding
his sister's old bike.

54
00:02:06,821 --> 00:02:08,155
Until he's
responsible enough

55
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:09,623
To take care
of his own bike.

56
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,492
Look, he spilled a soda
on my computer.

57
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:14,561
He ruined our digital
camera taking pictures
of himself underwater.

58
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:15,796
It's a girl's bike.

59
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:17,397
I'm all for teaching him
a lesson,

60
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:19,600
But I worry about
the ridicule he might get

61
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,435
From some
loudmouth bully.

62
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,636
[ horn honks ]

63
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:24,137
[ laughing ] hey.

64
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:25,606
Nice bike, sally.

65
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,007
Dad!

66
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,209
Come on. He looks like
little bo peep on that thing.

67
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:31,778
Actually, not for long.
He's getting a new
bike this afternoon.

68
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:32,746
I am?
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:34,014
He is?

70
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:36,717
Phil: Sometimes a man's
gotta put his foot down

71
00:02:36,784 --> 00:02:38,585
And do what a man's gotta do.

72
00:02:38,653 --> 00:02:40,487
And if the old lady
don't like it...

73
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:42,122
Honey?

74
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,994
...That's too damn bad.

75
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:49,763
Mitchell: Yes!
Who's excited, huh?

76
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,399
Cam, come on. Hurry up.
We're gonna be late.

77
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,135
It's a toddler play class,
not a flight to cabo.

78
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:57,371
We're gonna be judged enough
as the only gay parents there.

79
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,839
I don't want to be
the late ones, too.

80
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:01,608
<i>Wow.
Paisley and pink.</i>

81
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,810
Was there something wrong
with the fishnet tank top?

82
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,812
Obviously not --
I'm wearing it underneath.

83
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,414
Kidding.
Just chill, please.

84
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:09,716
I'm sorry. I just want to make
a good first impression.

85
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,052
You mean you want to fit in
and not terrify the villagers?

86
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,988
No, hey, come on.
Today is about lily, all right?

87
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:17,291
We -- her future best friend
might be in that class,

88
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:19,693
And I don't want to rub anyone
the wrong way.

89
00:03:19,761 --> 00:03:22,863
Can you please just...
Change your shirt?

90
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,331
Fine.
You know what?

91
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,799
I'll just go put on a pair
of khakis, maybe a polo shirt,

92
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:26,833
And everybody will think

93
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:28,502
We're a couple
straight golfing buddies

94
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,704
Who just decided
to have a kid together.

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,308
Hey, I called
that place in napa

96
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:36,610
And got us upgraded
to a villa with a hot tub,

97
00:03:36,678 --> 00:03:38,579
So pack whatever you wear
in a hot tub.

98
00:03:38,646 --> 00:03:40,414
Mwah!

99
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,283
I usually wear nothing
when I'm in a hot tub.

100
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:46,620
Neralmente no uso nada
and my college roommate's wife
just had to get a new hip.

101
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:48,388
[ laughing ] sucker.

102
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:51,491
Manny's father is
taking him for a couple
of days to disneyland,

103
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,660
So we're gonna go...
To the wine country!

104
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,163
We're gonna drink some wine,
eat some good food.

105
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,066
You know, we would do something
like this a lot more often

106
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:00,934
If it sn't for,
you know, manny.

107
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,970
It's good.
He keeps us grounded.

108
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,738
Yeah.

109
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:07,240
Like fog at  airport.

110
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:08,942
Limo gets here at 4:00.

111
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,744
This morning, I thought
I'd go over to the club,
hit a few balls.

112
00:04:10,812 --> 00:04:13,480
No! What about the fan
in manny's room?

113
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:14,681
Oh, yeah.

114
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:15,782
Call a guy.

115
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,352
No! You're supposed to
do it with him.

116
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:21,154
It's important that
we teach him how to
do things for himself.

117
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:23,991
In my culture, men take great
pride in doing physicalabor.

118
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:27,527
I know. That's why I hire
people from your culture.

119
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:28,862
[ laughs ]

120
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,797
You're snny!

121
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,866
I'm gonna share that one
with my next husband

122
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,369
When we're spending
all your money.

123
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:39,139
Dad, this is
the coolest bike ever.

124
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,240
Awesome.

125
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:42,376
So, listen, buddy.

126
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,177
Certain members
of this family

127
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:46,713
Don't think you can take care
of this bad boy.

128
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,715
U mean mom?
Your words, not mine.

129
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:52,552
Look, uh,
your mom and I are a team,

130
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,389
And she -- we feel
like this is a chance

131
00:04:55,456 --> 00:04:57,891
For you to show
some responsibility.

132
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,993
Don't make us
look like jerks here.

133
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,194
I won't.

134
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:03,330
Okay.
One more rule.

135
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:04,398
What?

136
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:07,234
Have, like,
three buttloads of fun.

137
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:08,301
Thanks, dad.

138
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:18,679
So, let's do this.

139
00:05:18,746 --> 00:05:20,547
Okay, but I need to be done
by 3:00.

140
00:05:20,615 --> 00:05:22,616
That's when
my dad's picking me up.

141
00:05:22,684 --> 00:05:23,984
Hey, if we're not done
by 3:00,

142
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,686
I'm gonna tie a noose
on this thing.

143
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:27,521
Gloria: In colombia,
there's a saying --

144
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:31,224
If you have two stubborn burros
that don't like each other,

145
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,593
You tie them to the same cart.

146
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:36,396
The ceiling fan is the cart.

147
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:38,532
My dad's takg me
on space mountain.

148
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:41,535
It's supposed to be
really fast, but he's
not scared of anything.

149
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:44,004
He d't even wear a seat belt
when he drives.

150
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,505
Wow.
How about that?

151
00:05:45,573 --> 00:05:46,973
He killed a bear once.

152
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,177
Really? Was the bear sitting
in the passenger seat?

153
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,713
Read me the instructions.

154
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,980
"safety tips.

155
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:56,183
Warning. To reduce the risk
of electrical shock --"

156
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,684
We can skip that.

157
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:01,154
Uh, "failure
to heed these warnings

158
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,956
Can lead to serious injury

his dad is like superman.

The truth?
He's a total flake.

In fact, the only way
he's like superman

00:06:18,706 --> 00:06:21,708
Is that they both landed
in this country illegally.

I do a pretty good claire.

to teach him a lesson

And let him think
his bike was stolen.

Now, I know
that sounds kind of rough,

00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,828
Luke: Hey, dad.

317
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:09,863
Hey.
Hey, buddy.

318
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:11,264
[ video game beeping ]

319
00:12:11,332 --> 00:12:13,466
That was, uh, that was
pretty fun today, huh,

320
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,634
Gettin' a new bike?

321
00:12:14,702 --> 00:12:15,902
Yeah, it was awesome.

322
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,737
So, uh, what happened
after I took off?

323
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,673
Anything you want to
share with me?

324
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,041
Not really.

325
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,842
So if I went out
to the garage

326
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,111
To take a picture
for the scrapbook,

327
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,646
There'd be no surprises?

328
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:29,683
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean it.

329
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,951
I just made a mistake.

330
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:32,986
<i>Yeah, a big mistake!</i>

331
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,055
You're making me look
really bad here.

332
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,057
I told mom
you were ready for this.

333
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,191
It's just a scratch, dad.

334
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,859
That's not the point,
luke -- what?

335
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,128
I scratched it
on my way into the driveway.

336
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:43,530
I'm sorry.

337
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:46,099
So...It's not stolen?

338
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,535
No. Why?

339
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,638
That's good, 'cause...

340
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,940
There are bad people out there
who would steal a bike.

341
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:55,742
Those are thieves.

342
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,612
You sit there and think
about the scratch part.
That's not good, either.

343
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,946
[ crack ]
gonna fix that step.

344
00:13:00,014 --> 00:13:01,881
So don't scratch anything
while I'm gone.

345
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,450
Unless it itches --
that's different.

346
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:08,021
The good news is,
luke has his bike.

347
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:09,656
More good news --

348
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:11,925
I taught some random kid
a valuable lesson

349
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,460
By stealing his bike.

350
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,029
Best news --
claire knows nothing.

351
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:19,099
So, I figure
I'll just dump the new bike

352
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,800
Where I stole the first bike.

353
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:23,036
That way,
random kid gets his back,

354
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:25,805
And this new bike doesn't rais
a lot of embarrassing questions,

355
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,007
Like why I had it

356
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,843
Or who boosted who
through a bedroom window.

357
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,412
So, everybods happy.

358
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,649
Uh-oh.

359
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,183
Oh, son of a --

360
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,219
You gave me
the wrong screwdriver.

361
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,254
Maybe you're
just using it wrong.

362
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,856
My dad's great with tools.

363
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,991
He can get the wheels off a car
in less than a minute.

364
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,193
Just get me to wine country.
Just get me to wine --

365
00:13:46,261 --> 00:13:47,194
Ooh. Oh!

366
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:48,429
Aah!
Sorry.

367
00:13:48,497 --> 00:13:49,964
I think
my arm is broken.

368
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:51,332
Relax.
It's not broken.

369
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,401
How do you know?
You don't know anything!

370
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:55,102
You have no concern
for safety.

371
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,038
Because it didn't hit you
that hard.

372
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:59,440
Why don't you just say it?
You don't want me around.

373
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:00,841
You know what?
Right now, I don't.

374
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,743
I don't want to be
with you, either.

375
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,078
I'm gonna go wait
for my dad.

376

but if you leave,

How will I ever finish?

378
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:10,751
You know what?
I wish you never married my mom.

379
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:12,053
I hate living here.

380
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,521
You think
I like this arrangement?

381
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:16,891
I got a two-seater
parked in the driveway.

382
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,141
[ laughs ] I mean,
I don't understand.

383
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,210
Why are you trying to sneak
around and hide things from me?

384
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:24,578
I actually think
it's pretty funny.

385
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:25,746
You do?

386
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,180
I do, yes.

387
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:29,683
I mean, you steal a bike
from some poor kid

388
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:32,219
And then the bike
gets stolen from you --

389
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,387
That's hilarious.

390
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:35,656
[ laughs ]
classic me, right?

391
00:14:35,723 --> 00:14:38,392
Yeah! So, where were you
when it got stolen?

392
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,927
Oh,
I was getting some gas.

393
00:14:39,994 --> 00:14:41,228
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

394
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,363
You don't stand near the car
when you get gas?

395
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:45,098
Yep, but, uh,
I went inside

396
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,567
To get a soda
because I was thirsty,

397
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:48,669
And if I had a sod
I wouldn't be thirsty anymore,

398
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:50,871
So I bought one, and then
I drank it all right there,

399
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,306
Which is why
I don't have the can.

400
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:53,540
Well, honey, please,

401
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:56,543
Let's try to remember that
I'm your wife, not your mom,

402
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:59,846
So in the future, you don't need
to hide things from me, okay?

403
00:14:59,914 --> 00:15:01,848
Okay.
Okay.

404
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,851

00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,219
You get back here, you!

00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:07,788
Claire:
What are you doing, phil?

407
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,056
I just love you
so darn much!

408
00:15:09,123 --> 00:15:10,724
I know, I love you, too,
but that hurts.

409
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:12,159
Let's get you inside.

410
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,193
It is a hot one.
Hi!

411
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:14,595
I know.
That's hurting a lot.

412
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,196
This is a hot one.
Hello! Hi, there!

413
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:17,798
Oh, hi!
Hi, again.

414
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:20,000
I, uh,
found your bike.

415
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,201
Uh...

416
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,770
Oh, good! You -- the --
at the gas station?

417
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,238
No, at my house.

418
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:27,441
One of my neighbors saw it
and put it in my garage

419
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:29,676
When you were
in my bedroom, so...

420
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:34,982
Classic me?

421
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:37,884
Come on, honey,
grab the block.

422
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,653
See, like  did.
You got to do that.

423
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:40,821
You got to grab it like him.

424
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,557
So, you seen
any m-movies lately?

425
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,891
Uh, yeah.

426
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,962
You know, my husband and I
just rented, uh, "mamma mia,"

427
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,597
Which I liked, but...

428
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,166
I don't know that meryl streep
was the right choice.

429
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,268
What did you think?

430
00:15:55,336 --> 00:15:57,638
Cameron:
Excuse me --

431
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,674
Meryl streep could play batman
and be the right choice.

432
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,175
She's perfection,

433
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:05,278
Whether she's divorcing kramer,
whether she's wearing prada.

434
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:08,081
Don't even get me started
on "sophie's choice."

435
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,550
I get emotional
thinking about it.

436
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:14,621
She couldn't forgive herself.

[ whimpers ]

438
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:21,695
I guess she was okay.

Really? Ugh.

Mitchell:
Grab the block, sweetheart.

442

You're not even interested
in it.

That is a big moment
for her.

Yeah.
Would you like
a videotape?

to do it again, so...

457
00:16:59,702 --> 00:17:02,770

all of our classes.

bringing cameras in.</i>

out of the moment.</i>

00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:32,033
Are you kidding me?

475
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,434
I am so sorry.

476
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:34,535
Look at those queens.

477
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:36,170
I would have killed
with this crowd,

478
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,872
But you had to
clip my wings,

479
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,707
Which you used to be
the wind beneath.

480
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,042
I know. I'm sorry.

481
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,777
This class has turned me
into a complete monster.

482
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:43,878
I'm -- I just --

483
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,379
I'll make it up to you.
Let's just go.

484
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,349
Okay, it's time
for parents dance!

485
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:51,085
Everybody dance
for your baby!

486
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,321
[ dance music plays ]

487
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,257
You want to do it,
don't you?

488
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,025
I do.

489
00:17:58,093 --> 00:17:59,894
I want to dance
for my baby.

490
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:01,896
[ sighs ] all right,
go on, get in there.

491
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:02,897
You sure?

492
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,466
Make that horsey move.
Go ahead.

493
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,340
[ all cheering ]

494
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,155
Oh,
I think I hurt myself.

495
00:18:40,135 --> 00:18:42,470

496
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,972
[ beep ]

497
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,207
Hello.

498
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,875
Hey, javier.

499
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,878
Manny's waiting for you outside.

500
00:18:50,946 --> 00:18:52,446
What?

501
00:18:52,514 --> 00:18:55,116
Why not?

502
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,652
Hold that thought.

503
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:01,622
His son's sitting on a curb,
waiting to go to disneyland,

504
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,960
And superman can't drag himself
away from a craps table.

505
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,062
<i>And I'm the jerk.</i>

506
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,667
Say, listen...

507
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,969
I, uh...

508
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,171
Sorry, but I got
some bad news.

509
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,339
What?

510
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,808
Your dad
couldn't make it.

511
00:19:20,876 --> 00:19:22,143
Why not?

512
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:23,544
The plane was full,

513
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,280
And this old lady
needed to get home,

514
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,982
So he gave up his seat.

515
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,550
You're making that up,
aren't you?

516
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:30,551
No.

517
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,020
He just didn't
want to come.

518
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,122
Are you kidding me?
He was very upset.

519
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:37,325
He was dying to see you.

520
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:40,328
In fact,
look what he sent.

521
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,496
A limo?

522
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,764
Yeah!

523
00:19:42,831 --> 00:19:45,667
He wanted me and your mom
to take you to disneyland.

524
00:19:45,734 --> 00:19:47,535
I told you
he was an awesome dad.

525
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,604
Yeah, he's a prince.

526
00:19:49,672 --> 00:19:51,072
Let me see...

527
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,009
Okay, the key to being
a good dad?

528
00:19:55,077 --> 00:19:57,979
Look, sometimes things work out
just the way you want.

529
00:19:58,047 --> 00:19:58,347
Race you to the end.

530
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:01,116
That is not a good idea...
For you.

531
00:20:02,986 --> 00:20:04,753
Sometimes they don't.

532
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:06,655
You got to hang in there...

533
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:09,925
Because when all is said
and done...

534
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,230
...90% of being a dad --

535
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,367
Just showing up.

536
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:31,380
Hey!
That's my bike!

537
00:20:31,448 --> 00:20:34,950
Oh.
I don't, uh...

538
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:36,251
Well...

539
00:20:38,288 --> 00:20:39,403
I was giving it back!

540
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:44,625
[ voice breaking ]
she couldn't forgive herself.

541
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,361
And...

542
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:48,863
She had to choose.

543
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:51,465
And I think
because now I have --

544
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:53,301
We have -- we have l--

545
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,635
We have lily,

546
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:59,073
It's so hard to imagine
being put in that position.

547
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,542
If I had to choose
lily or mitchell,

548
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,277
I mean, I would choose l--

549
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:06,948
I don't know!
I just -- I don't know!
