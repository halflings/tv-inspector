00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,420
[Phil]
Steaks will be ready
in five minutes.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,380
You're destroying those things.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,633
Ay, Jay, leave him alone.
No, I'm sorry, but that cow
has suffered long enough.

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:11,136
- Fun.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,013
Hang on. Dinner's
ready in five minutes.

6
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:15,015
Coach wants us
to practice layups.

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:18,101
They are deceptively hard-
a curious mix of dance and strength.

8
00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,937
- You're making it lame again.
- Sorry.

9
00:00:21,022 --> 00:00:24,232
- Ay, Dios mîo, that coach.
- Oh, I hate that guy.

10
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:26,359
He seems to have
the kids motivated.

11
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:29,529
Oh, Dad, you haven't seen him.
He taunts the kids. He's abusive.

12
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,907
Listen, if this was
a Colombian soccer league,
long time ago,

13
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,326
one of the kids would have
taken that guy out and-
[Cutting Sound]

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,745
A coach is supposed
to ride the kids hard.

15
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:38,830
- Phil, help me out here.
- He's a mean man.

16
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,374
Oh, you're such a woman.
Come to the game.
You'll see.

17
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,585
This guy's a real motherscratcher.
Pardon the language, Gloria.

18
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:45,462
- Mm-hmm.
- "Gloria"?

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:49,049
He better cool it,
or I'm gonna introduce him
to the Captain and Tennille.

20
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,592
[Mitchell]
Oh, hi.

21
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,594
Sorry we're late.
I was at work.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,138
Oh, he loves to say that.
And happy barbecue.

23
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,307
Oh.
[Cameron]
Since Mitchell is between jobs,

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,976
I've taken a part-time job
at a greeting card store,

25
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,937
which I love.

26
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,773
Plus, with my discount,
we're saving a fortune.

27
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:10,070
How is spending a ton of money
on greeting cards
saving us a fortune?

28
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,030
It's math.

29
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,407
It's really not.
Look it up.

30
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,620
2.95. 2.95. 4.95.

31
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,121
Forty percent off.
2.95.

32
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,790
3.95.
Forty percent off.
Forty percent off.

33
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,584
Mitchell, I got this
golf buddy of mine.

34
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:27,045
Great guy. Super successful.
You two should talk.

35
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,881
It could mean a job for you.
Oh, thanks, Dad, but I'm-

36
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,801
I'm not really looking
for anything right now. But-
Yeah, that's right.

37
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,262
With me bringing home the bacon,
Mitchell doesn't have to rush into anything.

38
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,014
Yeah, I know you have all that
greeting card "screw you" money,

39
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:39,599
but, uh, talk to the guy?

40
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,268
He's expecting your call
in the morning.

41
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:43,937
Dad, I appreciate it,
but in the future-
I can't stand this.

42
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,230
I am sorry, but I-

43
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,774
No. Those steaks have been done
for five minutes.

44
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,359
I'm taking 'em off the grill.

45
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,948
I'm sorry. I know how it feels
to have him stick his nose
where it doesn't belong.

46
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,950
No biggie.
It's just Jay being Jay.

47
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,952
But one day I'm gonna be
a grandfather,

48
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,037
and then everybody better
hide their meat.

Ooh. Who's she?

00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,849
I hate it when you do that.

54
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,809
[Chuckles]
Who's he?
It's Charlie Bingham.

55
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:26,104
He's the guy that my dad
wanted me to call.
I googled him. Look.

56
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,024
Oh, he owns Earthgear Apparel.
I have their ski pants.

57
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,817
Really? You don't-
You don't ski.

58
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,862
I have cargo pants
and I don't work at the docks.

59
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:37,657
God, I feel like such a slacker.
I mean, he has done so much
for being so young.

60
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,411
Okay, look. He's opened up
a dozen environmental foundations
and conservancies.

61
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:44,247
Wow.
So, you gonna-
you gonna call him?

62
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:48,293
I don't know. I mean, you know,
I sort of promised myself and you...

63
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,587
that I'd take
a little time off, and-

64
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,548
And you are loving
your time off.
Totally.

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,135
I am losing my mind.

66
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,137
As much as I love Lily-

67
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,473
which is, you know,
more than life itself-

68
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,393
I am- whoo- not cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad.

69
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,897
No, but it's Cameron's turn.
It's Cameron's turn to be
out in the world...

70
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,399
interacting with other grown-ups
while I get to stay at home...

71
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:14,277
and-and plot the death
of Dora the Explorer.

72
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:20,241
Like to fill her backpack
with bricks and throw her
into Candy Cane River.

73
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:23,161
So, I don't know. Should I-
Should I call him?

74
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,206
I don't know. Maybe just to
get your dad off your back.
Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,292
I mean, because
the last thing I want for you
is to take a job right now.

76
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,253
Mmm.
I am loving our life.

77
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,714
I am in a really dark space.

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,509
Being away from my Lily
is literally torture.

79
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,552
[Weeping]
And I can't pressure Mitchell,

80
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:42,555
but I really, really, really
just want him to get a job...

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,810
so I can go back to being
a stay-at-home dad/trophy wife!

[Coach] Come on, ladies!
Move it! Goodness gracious!
Turtles run faster!

Come on!
Could you run any slower?

00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,739
I dare you to run slower!

You see?
He's just trying
to light a fire.

Oh, I'll light him on fire!

88
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,246
Why do I always have to
come to these things?

89
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,415
Because you love your brother.

90
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,583
Why don't you make him come
to my orchestra concerts?

91
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,086
Because we love
your brother.

Okay.
[Chuckles]
That's great.

I'll let you know. Right.

All right. Bye.

Uh, so, Charlie Bingham
just invited us over...

101
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,446
to his beach house
for a little get-together.
Oh. Uh, what did you say?

102
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,824
I said I'd check with you.
I mean, what do you think?

00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,411
[Mouths Words]
What do you think?
[Sighs]

104
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,455
Well, I think it'd be rude
not to hear him out.

105
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,748
Yeah. I mean, yeah.
You're probably right.
Yeah.

106
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,375
- Okay.
- Cool.

107
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,336
And don't worry. You know,
I'm not gonna take any job.
[Laughs]

108
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:57,464
You better not.

I just-

I just miss...
my grilled cheese sandwiches!

113
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,564
You're doing great, Luke-
if your goal is to suck!

114
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:15,815
Phil, you-
I'm on it.

115
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,858
Okay.
Wait for me.

[Whistle Blows]

117
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,235
Hey, Coach.
Yeah?

118
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,237
Uh, look. We appreciate
your passion,

119
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,073
but some of us are
worried that the yelling is
getting counterproductive.

120
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,825
I got this.
Come on, stupid!

121
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,662
No, you don't "got this."
What you got is a bad attitude.

00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,164
Who are you?

123
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,708

Doesn't matter who.
What you need to start doing...

126
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,717
is a little more coaching
and a little less yelling.

127

'Cause if I hear you call one
of these kids stupid again,

I don't need this.

a better job? You coach.

I was handling it.

Yeah, I saw how you broke out
Peaches and Herb.

It's the Captain and-

[Cheering]

135
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,786
Okay. So, your old coach
had to leave for a little while.

136
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,788
Why? Is he sick?

137
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,415
- Yes. He's very, very sick.
- Is he going to die?

138
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,668
Everybody dies, boys.
Let's focus on what's important.

139
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:21,798
Our next game is in one hour.
We are going to go from being
five fingers to being a fist.

How does that sound?
[All]
Great.

I can't hear you.
Great!

00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,512
That's what
I'm talkin' 'bout!

143
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,514
All right, gentlemen.
I talked to the referee.
I'm coaching.

144
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,976
Oh, really? 'Cause I-
Phil, I coached football.

145
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,853
Jay, I actually coached basketball.
I think I can get these guys-

146
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,064
Relax. You've already got
the assistant job.

147
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,149
Now you think you can
round us up some waters?

- Yeah.
