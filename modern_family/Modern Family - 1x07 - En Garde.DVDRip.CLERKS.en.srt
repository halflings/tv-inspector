00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,834
I ain't gonna quit you.

151
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,836
Let's burn one in here.

152
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,297
That's good.
That's a good start.

153
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:49,469
Okay, you rest that cannon
while I run this down, okay?

154
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,972
Okay, let's keep
all the batters right here.

155
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:56,684
Oh, should've-
should've worn my cup.
Should've worn my cup.

156
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,561
Home run!

157
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,730
This one's
really in here, buddy.

158
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,568
[Exhaling]

159
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:09,155
Okay. Very, very, very,
very good first hour.

160
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,741
Toss me your glove.
I'll put some oil on it.

161
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,703
Yeah.

162
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:18,831
¡Ay, abuela, es que
lo que yo te diga es poco!

163
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,042
Esto hubiera sido
la locura en Barranquilla.

164
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,711
No, es que tú no sabes.
¡Mejor que su padre!

165
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,089
Bueno, hasta luego, porque
aquí ya llegó Jay. Adiós.
[Phone Beeps]

166
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,007
Everything okay?
Yes.

167
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,385
I was telling my grandmother
how great was Manny today.

168
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:34,013
So that wasn't angry talk?
No, silly.
That was happy talk.

169
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:36,974
I'm beginning to understand
why there's so much conflict
on your continent.

170
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,268
Here. Check this out.

171
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,730
Ah, Jay.
[Chuckles]

172
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:46,359
Jay loves to make T-shirts
for special occasions.

173
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,319
Come on, baby.
Show them.

174
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,199
A few years back,
my granddaughter Haley ran a 5K,
so I had a few of these made up.

175
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,994
It's just fun.
[Chuckles]

176
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,581
I love it when you're
so proud of Manny.
You know, I'm not gonna lie.

177
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:05,211
Seeing him out there
slicing those kids to pieces,
you know, it gets to ya.

178
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,005
- Gracias, mi amor.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

179
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,550
It's okay, papi.
Hey, champ! I got
a little something for you.

180
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,469
And I have something
for you. Here.

181
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,390
I will not be
needing it anymore.

182
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,309
- But the finals?
- I am retired.

183
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,442
[Birds Chirping]
[Jay]
Wait, wait, wait.

184
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,194
You can't retire.

185
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,781
- It's just not fun anymore.
- Well, that's probably just
butterflies.

186
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,533
Come on. You're gonna be fine.

187
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,703
Look, if he doesn't want to,
it's his decision.

188
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,705
Ah, the hell it is.

189
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,751
He shouldn't be doing anything
that makes him nervous.
Papi, I support you.

190
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,462
I'm not nervous.
I just don't want to
fight a girl.

191
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,422
What?

192
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Defeating a woman will be
a mark on my honor.
[Gloria] Why?

193
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,677
Because men are always
so superior to woman?

194
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,013
- Uh-
- Uh, uh.

195
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,975
So superior that you cannot
even finish your sentence?

196
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,643
Dude.

197
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:07,106
Manny, you always call
yourself the lover of women,

198
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,108
but if you don't compete
with this girl,

199
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,779
you're showing me
and all the woman that
you don't respect us.

200
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,864
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,325
Okay, so,
take back your sword...

202
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,661
- and go fight this girl like a bull.
- Okay.

203
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,663
Can't hear you!
Okay!

204
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:26,167
- I can't hear you!
- That's really as loud
as I can go.

205
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,797
What does it take
to make a great salesman?
It's no big secret.

206
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:34,467
You just follow the ABC's
of salesmanship-
Always Be Closing.

207
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,137
Don't Ever Forget
Great Home Ideas Just
Keep Lurking, Mostly Nearby.

208
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,640
Often People Question
Realtors' Sincerity.

209
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:42,642
Take Umbrage.
Violators Will-

210
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,393
Oh, shoot. X- X-

211
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,395
And this is
the great room,

212
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,398
although "great" hardly
seems to do a room
like this justice.

213
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,692
Weird, squiggly painting
not included.

214
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,320
I actually love it.
I do too.
It's really beautiful.

215
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,448
Um, all custom built-ins,
and you will notice just-

216
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,034
just tons of natural light,
so that's great.

217
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,995
Did I need the sale? Yes.
Was I worried? No.

218
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,248
Why? Because.
Because why?

219
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,668
Because I won't sell anything
I don't believe in.

220
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:13,214
And when I believe,
you believe.

221
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,341
I could sell a fur coat
to an Eskimo.

222
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,510
Yeah, Phil, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful house.

223
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:21,138
But I'm just not sure how
kid-friendly it is, and we
have two small children.

224
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,182
I mean,
these stairs alone-
Dad, this place is awesome.

225
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:27,061
Not now, Luke.
Did you see the backyard?
It's got room for 10 tree houses.

226
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,357
And the bedroom's got
a window on the ceiling.
I wish we could live here.

227
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,735
- I wish you'd go back
out to the patio where-
- Do you really?

228
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,447
Oh, yeah. Our house sucks
compared to this one.

229
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,492
- Hmm.
- It really does.

230
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,872
[Phil Chuckles]
There you are.

231
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,374
I'm gonna get changed
and then we'll go back
to Manny's match, okay?

232
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,586
Dad doesn't want me to go.
What? Why?

233
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,422
Remember when
you were all worried
that our son's a dud?

234
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:56,507
Okay. That's not exactly
the way I remember it.

235
00:11:56,592 --> 00:11:58,593
Turns out he's a natural.

236
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:01,804
At what?
At selling.

237
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,182
Hey, titans of
residential real estate.

238
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:10,396
That's right, I'm talking
to you, Sandy Brewster,
Skip Woosnum, J.J. McCubbin.

239
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,568
Hear those footsteps?
That's Luke Dunphy, and he's
gonna drink your milk shake.

240
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,696
That's amazing.

241
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,448
Right?
Incredible.

242
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:23,409
So, the buyer's coming back
in an hour with her husband,
and I need him.

243
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,244
I am telling you,
that kid is a genius.

244
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,622
There's the rainmaker.

245
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,292
- Why is your iPod in your mouth?
- I'm charging it.

246
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,795
Alex. Alex!

247
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:42,553
So, there's no part of you
that wants to clear the air
with your sister?

248
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,264
Nope.
Okay, fine. That's your family's
way. I'll respect that.

249
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:47,892
But you should know,
it's hard on the people
who love you.

250
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:51,896
Cam-
We feel the tension. We hear
the words that cut like knives.

251
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,523
Hey, guys!
I brought orange slices.

252
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,484
Okay, you know what?
I can't bear this.

253
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,821
Claire, Mitchell still resents
you for quitting the figure
skating team when you were kids.

254
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,408
Ladies, come inside with me,
please. Work it out. Come on.

255
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,203
Thanks, Cam.
Is he serious?

256
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,916
Is that what your little jab
was about this morning?
Okay. No. Yes. Okay, yes. Yes.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,753
I guess I'm still a little angry.
But, you know, you stole
my moment, Claire.

258
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,797
Yeah, 21 years ago.
Okay, but it
doesn't matter to you...

259
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,757
because you had
your own moments.

260
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:23,219
You had cheerleading and
high school plays and making out
with the quarterback.

261
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,722
You made out with him too.
Yeah, but we had to
keep it a secret.

262
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,477
You shouldn't have quit.
It was selfish.
You wanna know why I quit?

263
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,605
I quit to protect you.
From what?

264
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,317
Glory? Fame?
Press conferences? What?
Come on. I was bigger than you.

265
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:41,153
I was bigger than you,
and I was afraid you wouldn't
be able to lift me.

266
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,030
You were dropping me
in practice-
I dropped you twice.

267
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,491
And I didn't want you to
humiliate yourself in front
of all those people.

268
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:50,204
Three times.
You dropped me all the time.
[Sighs]

269
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,584
Come on. Could you just
forgive me and move on?
[Exhales]

270
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,673
Of course.
Yes, yes. Yes, of-
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

271
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,718
Oh. This must seem
so petty, huh?

272
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,138
Well, it's a little silly,
but we all have our thing,
don't we?

273
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,598
I'm just glad you're
getting it out of you.

274
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:13,769
Are you trying to lift me? You are.
You're trying to lift me. Oh!

275
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,653
Stay focused, stay loose
and stay angry.

276
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:25,656
Who's the toughest?
I am.

277
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,993
Who's the bravest?
I am.

278
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,661
Who's the baddest?

279
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:34,206
Can you guys ask all
the questions now so I don't
have to keep lifting this?

280
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,917
Go.
Go get 'em!

281
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,961
There we go.
You all set?
Yeah.

282
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,422
Okay, go get 'em.
Good luck.

283
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,758
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?
No. Sit.

284
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,885
Oh, thank you.

285
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,429
Oh, is Manny yours?
Yes.

286
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,765
Oh, he's quite good.
I saw him earlier.

287
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,391
Thank you.
Yeah.

288
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,602
Is she your little girl?
Oh, Caroline?
No. No.

289
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,937
Sadly, her parents
passed away.

290
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm her nurse down at
the children's hospital.

291
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,193
But all of my patients
are like family to me.

292
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,409
[Laughing]
[Man] Well, our boys
are enjoying themselves.

293
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:15,039
Yeah. I can talk about crown
moldings and recessed lighting
until the cows come home,

294
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,166
but nothing compares with
that sound right there.
[Footsteps Approaching]

295
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,502
[Thud]
Ow! Ow!

296
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,838
Oh. Hey, buddy.
Oh, he's fine.
Ow.

297
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,548
My foot.
I think it's backwards.

298
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,759
It's not backwards.
[Man]
Wh-What happened?

299
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,595
[Luke]
It's the stupid floors!
They're too slippery.

300
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,347
Oak. Also known
as nature's pillow.

301
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,975
It's like ice.
Now, let's not start
blaming the floors.

302
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,728
You shouldn't
have been running.
I saw a ghost.

303
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:43,943
Ghosts. Hey, Phil Dunphy.
Okay, that's me.

304
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,945
That's acting like
a natural shoehorn.

305
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,407
Okay. Probably better all
take our shoes off for this part
of the tour. Follow me.

306
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,701
She's our little miracle.

307
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:58,457
Oh. I only wish her father had
made it back from Afghanistan
to see this.

308
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,418
[Clattering]
Oh, there's
our cheering section.

309
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,879
Over here, you guys.
Hi.

310
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,302
Oh, my God.
We have to stop him.

311
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,389
[Mouthing Words]

312
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,312
Maybe I can pull
the fire alarm.

313
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,607
[Whistle Blows]
Expect no mercy.

314
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,068
Bring it on, big boy.

315
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,990
- [Whistle Blows]
- I'm-I'm glad Dad's
proud of Manny. I am.

316
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,452
I just- It would have
been nice to see him
that proud of us.

317
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:39,665
By us, I mean me.
[Scoffs]

318
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,418
And you sincerely
thought that the path
to Dad's approval...

319
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,420
was going to be through
figure skating?

320
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,548
Mitchell,
I am fairly confident that
Dad's proudest moment...

321
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,925
was when you finally took off
the flame-red unitard.

322
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,803
I am not claiming that
any of this is rational.

323
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:59,018
I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for being such a pill, okay?

324
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,523
Um, actually, I always felt
very guilty for quitting.

325
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,609
I know how much
you loved figure skating.

326
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,613
I never really loved skating.

327
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:13,532
Uh, what?

328
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:16,285
Um, all right, this is
gonna sound a little gay.

329
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,371
But, um, when-when
you and I skated together,

330
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,875
you weren't the mean
older sister and I wasn't
the clingy little brother.

331
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,877
We were-
We were a team, and-

332
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,880
Well, let's face it,
we've kind of grown apart
in the past few years.

333
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,217
And with Mom and Dad's divorce,
we were on opposing sides.

334
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:35,304
And I- I just-
I miss being on your team.

335
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:42,603
That's...

336
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,025
a little gay.
There we go.

337
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,989
Claire,
where are you going?

338
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,283
Claire?

339
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:58,327
No way.

340
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,287
Get up.

341
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,331
Really?
Mm-hmm.

342
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,416
[Exhales]

343
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,380
Don't drop me.

344
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,924
[Whistle Blows]
[Buzzer Sounds]

345
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,387
[Whistle Blows]

346
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,097
[Buzzer Sounds]
[All Groan]

347
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,099
[Whistle Blows]

348
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,310
[Buzzer Sounds]
Put it away or lose it.

349
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,939
[Whistle Blows]

350
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,066
[Buzzer Sounds]
[Spectators Groan]

351
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,318
Somebody's got to put
a stop to this.

352
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,158
That's it, Mitchell.

353
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,538
[Whistle Blows]

354
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,125
[Buzzer Sounds]
[People Groan]

355
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,629
So, can we take you
and Caroline out
for ice cream?

356
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:53,424
We can't.
She's diabetic.

357
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,134
Of course she is.

358
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,720
[Man] A round of applause
for our winner, Manny Delgado.
[Scattered Applause]

359
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,100
Let's get out of here.
Get this thing in the trunk.

360
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,479
I can't decide
if I'm feeling more proud
or mortified.

361
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,773
How about now?

362
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:21,035
[Jay]
We tell our kids it doesn't
matter if you win or lose,

363
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,870
but let's be honest.

364
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,123
Winning feels pretty great.

365
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:29,918
There's nothing like that
golden moment in the sun.

366
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,257
I think every parent probably
wants that for their child.
[Laughs]

367
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,428
And maybe a little bit
for ourselves too.

368
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,724
[Laughing]
Sometimes we push too hard.

369
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,896
And that leads to a lot
of resentment and guilt.
Yes! Yes!

370
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,608
So, how much is too much?
Here's where I come out.

371
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,902
Guilt fades.

372
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,988
Hardware is forever.

373
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,541
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm not mad.

374
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:11,543
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

375
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,588
You're a little jealous.
I'm happy for the two of you.

376
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,466
All right, come on.
We'll do one. Stay there.

377
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,551
For real?
Yep.

378
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:31,397
Feel better?
Yeah. Oh, do me now.
Come on.

379
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,732
What are you talking about?

380
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,984
Are you serious?

381
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,945
- Cam, no.
