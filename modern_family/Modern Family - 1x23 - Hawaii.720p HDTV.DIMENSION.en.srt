My bad!

7
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:25,763
We didn't even have
a proper wedding.

8
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:27,988
We just went down to the
courthouse on a Tuesday.

9
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:31,776
The judge sentenced me to
life with no chance of parole.

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,884
You begged me to marry you.

11
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:35,389
It's true. I did.

12
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:38,303
Oh! Hold on, my bride.
Allow me. Oh!

Claire: Whoa.
What are you doin'?

00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:41,723
Being romantic.
God, you're solid.

00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:42,762
Sweetie, put me down.

16
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh. Go on. Okay.

17
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:44,903
Honey, come on.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,876
Let's turn this vacation
into a honeymoon.

19
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,850
Sweet pea, I'm a mom
traveling with my kids.

20
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:51,228
For me, this is not a vacation.
It's a business trip.

21
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:52,732
Let's go.

22
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:56,144
Wow.    Wow. Wow.
Wow.

Don't you want to

I ticed some lovely tweens
down by the kids club.

Maybe we can find a nice
spot near them by the pool

38
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,503
And send over a couple
of virgin mai tais.

00:01:40,537 --> 00:01:43,341
They may be interested in two

And put on some sunscrn, please.

We have got to stay

Totally. Listen.

00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:12,957
They put on the littlest bit

Does anybody want to come?

Mitchell: The great
thing about cameron

00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,160
Is that he's adventurous,
like I am.

65
00:02:37,194 --> 00:02:39,129
And we -- we both like
to immerse ourselves

In the culture and really
get to know the locals.

We actually send him
all of our old clothes.

00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,377
He was a very nice
man when we met him,

72
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:54,979
But based on his recent letters,

73
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:56,881
I have a small fear
he's become a warlord.

Jay, I'm gonna go to the gym
to work out a little bit.

You want to come with me?

I just ordered an
extra-long straw

Ah, don't worry.
He never took caref himself.

Mm-hmm.

Is it because they're delicious?

No.

116
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:19,382
It's because they want
to give their female --

want to go with you.

Well, it is a big one -
the lavender ranch,

Where they grow 45 different
varieties of lavender. 45.

You hear that,
kids? 45 different varieties.

Yeah, I can't sell that.

and I first met,

I may have exaggerated my
interest in adventurous travel

<i>By implying that I had any.</i>

he loves most about me,

And I can't tell
him the truth now.

156
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:53,303
It would be like
lewis telling clark

That he didn't like to walk.

My back seized up.

483
00:17:16,606 --> 00:17:18,272
Yeah, because you overdid it

484
00:17:18,307 --> 00:17:20,508
After that phone call
about your father.

485
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,976
I can't believe I'm
as old as he was.

486
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,212
Let me sit down here. [ groans ]

487
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:28,348
[ sighs deeply ]

488
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,383
You'd have liked him -
my old man.

489
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,584
I'm sure.

490
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,818
And he'd have loved you.

491
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,253
My god. That guy was a charmer.

492
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:40,755
Mm, I know the type.

493
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,890
Yeah, we had a lot of fun.

494
00:17:43,924 --> 00:17:45,891
But I'll tell you something.

495
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:49,127
Our family vacations were
nothing like this here.

496
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:52,028
One week a year in a rented
cottage on lake erie,

497
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,096
<i>Spiders this big.</i>

498
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,830
[ chuckles ]

499
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:57,865
I just wish he could have
seen how things turned out.

500
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:59,499
Well, if you keep
going like this,

501
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,100
Maybe you can tell him yourself.

502
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:02,534
<i>Or I can tell him,</i>

503
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:04,435
Because you're about
to kill me, jay.

504
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,938
My legs, my arms,
my back -- everything is sore.

505
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,506
So, I wore you out, huh?

506
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,741
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't get cocky, old man.

507
00:18:11,775 --> 00:18:13,709
When I sit down,
I can still get up.

508
00:18:13,744 --> 00:18:14,710
Hey.

509
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,678
Hey.

510
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,579
Okay. Come on.

511
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:18,580
Mm.

512
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:20,414
Come here. Come here.

513
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,482
[ chuckles ]

514
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,016
The rest of the
trip went better.

515
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,450
Haley's room stopped spinning.

516
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:25,751
Claire: And the monkey?

517
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:26,952
There she is!

518
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,119
Hey!    Hey! Hey!
Hey!

519
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,288
Oh, honey. Do you want
some eggs benedict?

520
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,289
So creamy.

521
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:32,256
No. No? Mm.

522
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,958
[ laughter ]

523
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:36,994
Phil: Jay got back to the
vacation he always wanted.

524
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,068
And mitch and cam managed
to do some sightseeing

525
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:46,970
At a working banana
plantation...

526
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,005
Cameron: Lily!

527
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:49,673
...Where they promptly
lost lily again.

528
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,575
Why did you dress
her in jungle print?

529
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,311
Because I thought
it would be cute!

530
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,247
She's gonna think
she's back in vietnam.

531
00:18:55,282 --> 00:18:57,450
Lily! Lily, honey!

532
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,785
Me and claire?

533
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,620
We...

534
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,088
We had a great time.

535
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,789
But we never did
get that honeymoon.

536
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,257
I ink I just expected
a little too much

537
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,458
From this vacation.

538
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,093
You were so sweet to try.

539
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,127
It was dumb.

540
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:13,196
Like you said,
the thrill is gone.

541
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,397
I never said that.

542
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,365
No, it's over.

543
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:17,866
But wait.

544
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,335
Put a few seconds
back on the clock.

545
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,538
The kid still has a few moves.

546
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:24,872
Oh, my god.

547
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:27,574
I figured out why we
couldn't have a honeymoon.

548
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,177
Because we never had a wedding.

549
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,546
Oh, my god.

550
00:19:32,614 --> 00:19:35,014
I still can't tell if you
think this is lame or cool.

[ ukulele music plays ]

552
00:19:36,149 --> 00:19:38,283
I think it's incredibly cool.

553
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,754
Looks like I finally get
to walk you down the aisle.

554
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:42,755
Daddy!

555
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,891
<i>Ow! You better walk me.</i>

556
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:46,826
Okay. I'll try.

557
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,795
We're here today to celebrate

558
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:51,730
The renewing of
the marriage vows

559
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:52,798
Of phil and claire.

560
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,133
On this day,

561
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:57,537
They've chosen to reaffirm
their love for each other.

562
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,139
You may kiss your bride.

Oh!

You know, honey,

If anything were
ever to happen to me,

576
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,974
I would want you
to get remarried.

Okay. Mm.

would marry if --

Vicki conroy, probably.
She works in my office.

She's very organized.
The kids love her.
