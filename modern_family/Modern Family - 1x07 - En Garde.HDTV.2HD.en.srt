162
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:09,902
[ chuckles ]

163
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,303
Oh,
you're such a geek!

164
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,672
At least I didn't
give myself a bald spot.

165
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,140
Oh, my god! Mom!

166
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,408
Alex, don't be mean.

167
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,278
Haley, stop making yourself
such an easy target.

168
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,312
This feels right, buddy.

169
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,780
I'm telling you,
this feels right.

170
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,719
What are you guys doing?
Pursuing excellence.

171
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,887
We made a list of areas
the baseball. Excel at, and...

172
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,488
Love it.
Yeah.

173
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,991
I read it only takes 10,000
hours to achieve excellence.

174
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,560
You've already got, like, what,
how many hours playing ball?

175
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,263
Well, I played,
like, one season.

176
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,266
So, like,
6,000 hours?

177
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,735
Yeah, I can see
why you ruled out math.

178
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,905
Claire: Yeah, of course
I want luke to be successful.

179
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,941
But I don't think that a parent
can just force that.

180
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,243
I think you just
have to have faith

181
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,712
That the kid's
gonna find his own way.

182
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,914
[ sighs ]

183
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,917
<i>Besides, luke already is
the best at something --</i>

184
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,518
Being my son.

185
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,253
[ chuckles ]

186
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,823
It sounded a lot less lame
in my head.

187
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,892
I have got a good feeling
about this.

188
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
This is gonna be
your sport.

189
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,963
<i>Last year, you said
basketball was my sport.</i>

190
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,432
<i>Look, I've said a lot of things
I wish I could take back,</i>

191
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,733
But I can't.

192
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:18,971
<i>What I can do is be
the dad you need me to be</i>

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,740
To help you
become masterful.

194
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,242
You want
to be masterful?

195
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,376
I guess.

196
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,578
There's my killer!
Okay.

197
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,615
Our journey
of 10,000 hours

198
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:32,685
Begins
with a single pitch.

199
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,954
I believe in my boy!

200
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:37,189
I ain't
gonna quit you.

201
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,124
Let's burn one in here.

202
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,660
That's good.
That's a good start.

203
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:43,462
Okay, you...

204
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,865
Rest that cannon
while I run this down, okay?

205
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,167
Okay.

206
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,336
Let's keep all the batters
right here.

207
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,538
Oh! Should have --
should have worn my cup.

208
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,006
Should have
wo my cup.

209
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,874
Home run!

210
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,077
This one's
really in here, buddy.

211
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,548
[ breathing heavily ]

212
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,782
Okay.

213
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,185
<i>Very, very, very, very good
first hour.</i>

214
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,188
Toss me your glove.
I'll put some oil...On it.

215
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,857
[ breathing heavily ]

216
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,025
Yeah.

217
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:16,261
[ speaking spanish rapidly
and forcefully ]

218
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,503
Everything okay?

219
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,271
Yes, I was telling
my grandmother

220
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,639
How great was manny
today.

221
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,974
So, that wasn't
angry talk?

222
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,243
No, silly,
that was happy talk.

223
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,711
Ah, I'm beginning
to understand

224
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,813
Why there's so much conflict
on your continent.

225
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,515
Here, check this out.

226
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,019
Aw, jay.
[ chuckles ]

227
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,756
Jay loves to make t-shirts
for special occasions.

228
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,557
Come on, baby,
show them.

229
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,160
A few years back,
my granddaughter haley ran a 5k,

230
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,696
So I had a few of these
made up.

231
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:51,897
It's just fun.

232
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,199
[ laughs ]

233
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,168
I love it when
you're so proud of manny.

234
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:57,770
You know,
I'm not gonna lie.

235
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,605
Seeing him out there
slicing those kids to pieces,

236
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,140
You know,
it -- it gets to you.

237
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,876
<i>Oye, gracias, mi amor.</i>

238
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:04,910
Manny:
I'm sorry to interrupt.

239
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,078
It's okay, papi.

240
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:07,646
Hey, champ. I got
a little something for you.

241
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,481
<i>And I have something
for you.</i>

242
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,582
Here.

243
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,553
I will not be needing it
anymore.

244
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,788
But the finals.

245
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,222
I am retired.

246
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:25,397
Jay:
You can't retire.

247
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,299
It's just not fun
anymore.

248
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,201
Well, it's probably
just butterflies.

249
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,902
Come on,
you're gonna be fine.

250
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,972
Look, if he doesn't want to,
it's his decision.

251
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,340
Oh, the hell it is.

252
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,610
He shouldn't be doing anything
that makes him nervous.

253
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,045
Papi, I support you.

254
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:42,781
I'm not nervous.
I just don't want
to fight a girl.

255
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:44,750
What?

256
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:46,752
Defeating a woman
would be a mark on my honor.

257
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,955
Why? Because men are always
so superior to a woman?

258
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:51,156
Uh...

259
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,591
Uh, uh!

260
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,426
So superior that you cannot
even finish your sentence?

261
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,929
Dude.

262
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,833
Manny, you always call yourself
the lover of women.

263
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,069
But if you don't compete
with this girl,

264
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,971
You're showing me
and all the women

265
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,874
That you don't
respect us.

266
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,042
I'm sorry.

267
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,476
Okay.

268
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,579
So take back your sword and go
fight this girl like a bull!

269
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:15,847
Okay.

270
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,349
Can't hear you!
Okay!

271
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,884
I can't hear you!

272
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,220
That's really
as loud as I can go.

273
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,656
Phil: What does it take
to make a great salesman?

274
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,791
It's no big secret.

275
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,026
You just follow the abc's
of salesmanship --

276
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,261
Always be closing.

277
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,529
Don't ever forget

278
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,398
Great home ideas
just keep lurking mostly nearby.

279
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,767
Often, people question
realtors' sincerity.

280
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,968
Take umbrage.

281
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,203
Violators will...

282
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,504
Oh, shoot, "x," "x," "x"...

283
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,173
And this is
the great room,

284
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,443
Although "great" hardly
seems to do a room
like this justice.

285
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,545
Weird squiggly painting
not included.

286
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:47,546
I actually love it.

287
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,414
I do, too.
It's really beautiful.

288
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,316
Um, all --
all custom built-ins.

289
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,852
And you'll notice just --
just tons of natural light,

290
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,087
So that's great.

291
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,588
Did I need the sale?
Yes.

292
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,789
Was I worried?
No.

293
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,324
Why? Because.

294
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,625
Because why?

295
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,495
Because I won't sell anything
I don't believe in.

296
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:08,066
<i>And when I believe, you believe.</i>

297
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,402
I can sell a fur coat
to an eskimo.

298
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,704
Yeah, phil, I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful house.

299
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,473
But I'm just not sure
how kid-friendly it is,

300
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,707
And we have
two small children.

301
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,008
I mean,
these stairs alone --

302
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,877
Dad, this place
is awesome.
Not now, luke.

303
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,112
Did you see
the backyard?

304
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,314
It's got room for,
like, 10 tree houses.

305
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,683
And the bedroom's got a window
on the ceiling.

306
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,318
<i>I wish
we could live here.</i>

307
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,220
I wish you'd go back out
to the patio, where --

308
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,488
Do you really?

309
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:30,789
Oh, yeah.

310
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,391
<i>Our house sucks
compared to this one.</i>

311
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,359
Hmm.

312
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,761
It really does.

313
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,195
[ chuckles, snorts ]

314
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,866
There you are.

315
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,335
I'm gonna get changed,
and then we're off to
manny's match, okay?

316
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,103
Dad doesn't
want me to go.

317
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,505
What? Why?

318
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,306
Remember when you were all
worried that our son's a dud?

319
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,376
Okay, that's not exactly
the way I remember it.

320
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,512
Turns out
he's a natural.

321
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,313
At what?

322
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,915
At selling.

323
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,751
Hey, titans of
residential real estate.

324
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,154
That's right, I'm talking
to you, sandy brewster,

325
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,723
Skip woosnum,
j.J. Mccubbin.

326
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,691
Hear those footsteps?

327
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,193
That's luke dunphy,

328
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,695
And he's gonna drink
your milkshake.

329
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:13,398
<i>That's amazing.</i>

330
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:14,966
Right?!
Incredible.

331
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,968
So, the owner's coming back
in an hour with her husband,

332
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,170
And I need him.

333
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,172
I am telling you,
that kid is a genius.

334
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,474
There's the rainmaker!

335
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,176
Why is your ipod
in your mouth?

336
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,977
I'm charging it.

337
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,212
Alex.

338
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,547
Alex!

339
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,487
Cameron:
So, there's no part of you

340
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,622
That wants to clear the air
with your sister?
Nope.

341
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,258
Okay, fine. That's your family's
way. I'll respect that.

342
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,494
But you should know it's hard
on the people who love you.

343
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,329
Cam, stop being
so dramatic.
We feel the tension.

344
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:46,498
We hear the words
that cut like knives.

345
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,867
Hey, guys!
I brought orange slices.

346
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,269
Okay, you know what?
I can't bear this.

347
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,971
Claire,
mitchell still resents you

348
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,507
For quitting the figure-skating
team when you were kids.

349
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,142
Ladies, come inside
with me, please.

350
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,143
Work it out.

351
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,144
Come on.

352
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,445
Thanks, cam.

353
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,880
Is he serious?

354
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,982
Is that what your little jab
was about this morning?

355
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,417
Okay, no --
yes. Okay, yes.

356
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,485
Yes, I'm -- I guess
I'm still a little angry.

357
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,921
But, you know,
you stole my moment, claire.

358
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,056
Yeah,
21 years ago.

359
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,824
Okay, no,
but it doesn't matter to you

360
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,526
Because you had
your own moments.

361
00:13:14,594 --> 00:13:16,094
You had cheerleading
and high-school plays

362
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,929
And, uh, making out
with the quarterback and --

363
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,698
<i>Oh, come on.
You made out with him, too.</i>

364
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,366
Yeah, but we had to
keep it a secret.

365
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,836
You shouldn't have quit.
It was selfish.

366
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,137
You want to know
why I quit?

367
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,173
<i>I quit to protect you.</i>

368
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,408
From what?
Glory? Fame?

369
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,810
No, come on.
Press conferences?

370
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:32,911
I was bigger
than you.

371
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,246
I was bigger
than you,

372
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,513
And I was afraid
you wouldn't be able to lift me.

373
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,115
You were -- you were dropping me
in practice,

374
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,351
And I didn't want you
to humiliate yourself...
I dropped you twice.

375
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,186
In front
of all of those people.
Three times.

376
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,388
<i>You dropped me
all the time.</i>

377
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:44,856
[ sighs ]

378
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,458
Come on.

379
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,262
Can't you just forgive me
and move on?
[ breathes deeply ]

380
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,331
Of cour-- yes, yes.
Yes, of cour--

381
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

382
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,401
Ugh.

383
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,270
God, this must seem
so petty to you, huh?

384
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,271
Well,
it's a little silly,

385
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,672
But we all have our thing,
don't we?

386
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,140
I'm just glad
you're getting it...

387
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,241
Out of you.

388
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,410
Are you trying
to lift me?!
Let me.

389
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:08,013
You are!
You're trying to lift me!

390
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,852
Stay focused, stay loose,
and stay angry.

391
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,520
Who's the toughest?

392
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:16,022
I am!

393
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,690
Who's the bravest?!

394
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,292
I am.

395
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,027
Who's the baddest?

396
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,729
<i>Can you guys
ask all the questions now</i>

397
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,497
So I don't have to
keep lifting this?

398
00:14:24,565 --> 00:14:25,465
Go.

399
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,333
Go get 'em!

400
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:28,701
Are you all set?
Yeah.

401
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:30,703
Okay, go get 'em!
Good luck!

402
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:31,771
[ chuckles ]

403
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,439
Excuse me --
is this seat taken?

404
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:35,742
No, sit.
Oh, thank you.

405
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,477
Oh,
is manny yours?

406
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,578
Yes.

407
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:40,747
Oh, he's quite good.
I saw him earlier.

408
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,081
Ay, thank you.
Yeah.

409
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:43,483
Is she
your little girl?

410
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,817
Oh, caroline?
No. No.

411
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,120
Sadly,
her parents passed away.

412
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,756
I'm her nurse down
at the children's hospital.

413
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,358
<i>But all of my patients
are like family to me.</i>

414
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,360
Oh.

415
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,229
[ sighs ]

416
00:14:58,549 --> 00:14:59,983
Man: Well, our boys
are enjoying themselves.

417
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,351
Yeah.

418
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,720
I can talk about crown moldings
and recessed lighting

419
00:15:03,788 --> 00:15:04,988
Till the cows
come home,

420
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,890
But nothing compares
with that sound right there.

421
00:15:06,957 --> 00:15:08,425
[ sneakers squeak, thud ]
luke: Ow!

422
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:09,926
Oh.
Ow!

423
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,227
Hey, buddy.

424
00:15:11,295 --> 00:15:12,562
Oh, he's fine.

425
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,997
My foot!
I think it's backwards!

426
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:15,432
[ chuckling ]
it's not backwards.

427
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,533
What happened?

428
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,635
It's the stupid floors.
They're too slippery.

429
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:21,070
Oak. Also known
as nature's pillow.

430
00:15:21,138 --> 00:15:22,205
It's like ice.

431
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:24,240
Now, let's not start
blaming the floors.

432
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:26,176
You shouldn't
have been running.

433
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,410
I saw a ghost.

434
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:29,846
G-ghost? [ chuckles ]

435
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:31,281
Hey -- phil dunphy.

436
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,282
O-kay.

437
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,616
That's me.

438
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:36,052
That's acting like
a natural shoehorn. Okay.

439
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,654
Probably better
all take our shoes off

440
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,988
For this part
of the tour.

441
00:15:39,056 --> 00:15:40,023
Follow me.

442
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,858
She's our
little miracle.

443
00:15:41,926 --> 00:15:42,859
Oh.

444
00:15:42,927 --> 00:15:44,194
I only wish
her father

445
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:47,263
Had made it back
from afghanistan to see this.

446
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:49,365
[ sighs ]

447
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:50,967
Oh! There's
our cheering section!

448
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,470
Over here, you guys!
[ chuckles ]

449
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:00,410
Oh, my god,
we have to stop him.

450
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:09,886
Maybe I can
pull the fire alarm.

451
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,089
Expect no mercy.

452
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,592
Bring it on, big boy.

453
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,328
[ whistle blows ]

454
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,497
I-I'm glad
dad's proud of manny. I am.

455
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,865
I just...

456
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:25,602
<i>It would have been nice
to see him that proud of us.</i>

457
00:16:25,669 --> 00:16:27,537
And by "us,"
I mean "me."

458
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:28,972
[ scoffs ]

459
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:31,774
And you sincerely thought
that the path to dad's approval

460
00:16:31,842 --> 00:16:33,776
<i>Was going to be
through figure skating?</i>

461
00:16:33,844 --> 00:16:36,679
Mitchell, I am fairly confident
that dad's proudest moment

462
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:39,349
<i>Was when you finally took off
the flame-red unitard.</i>

463
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,218
I am not claiming
that any of this is rational.

464
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,855
I'm -- I'm sorry.

465
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:49,192
I'm sorry for being
such a pill, okay?

466
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,560
I...

467
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:53,663
Actually always felt
very guilty for quitting.

468
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,999
Look, I know how much
you loved figure skating.

469
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:00,436
I...Never
really loved skating.

470
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,671
Uh, what?

471
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,740
[ chuckles ]
um, all right.

472
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,542
This is gonna sound
a little gay.

473
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,478
But, um, when --
when you and I skated together,

474
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:10,280
You know, you weren't
the mean older sister

475
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:12,181
And I wasn't the --
the clingy little brother.

476
00:17:12,249 --> 00:17:13,416
We were --
we were a team.

477
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:14,918
And, well,
let's face it,

478
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:17,020
We've kind of grown apart
in the past few years,

479
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,721
And -- and with
mom and dad's divorce,

480
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,458
We were on opposing sides,
and I just...I...

481
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:24,561
I just -- I miss
being on your team.

482
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,568
That's...

483
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,338
...A little gay.

484
00:17:35,406 --> 00:17:37,173
Okay, there we go.

485
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:42,946
Claire,
where are you going?

486
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,480
Claire?

487
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,417
No way!

488
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,218
Get up.

489
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:50,853
Really?
Mm-hmm.

490
00:17:50,921 --> 00:17:53,222
[ breathes deeply ]

491
00:17:55,893 --> 00:17:57,894
Don't drop me.

492
00:17:57,962 --> 00:17:59,529
[ whistle blows ]

493
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:02,165
[ buzzer ]

494
00:18:02,232 --> 00:18:03,633
[ whistle blows ]

495
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,468
[ metal clashing ]

496
00:18:05,536 --> 00:18:07,136
Oh!
Oh!

497
00:18:07,204 --> 00:18:08,338
[ whistle blows ]

498
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:10,239
[ buzzer ]

499
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:12,742
Put it away
or lose it.

500
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,943
[ whistle blows ]

501
00:18:16,046 --> 00:18:16,980
[ buzzer ]

502
00:18:17,047 --> 00:18:18,147
Woman: That's awful.

503
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:20,316
Somebody's got to
put a stop to this.

504
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,123
That's it, mitchell.

505
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,996
[ whistle blows ]

506
00:18:33,063 --> 00:18:35,932
[ buzzer ]

507
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,435
So, can we take you and caroline
out for ice cream?

508
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,803
We can't.

509
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,472
She's diabetic.

510
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,440
Of course she is.

511
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:49,979
Let's get
out of here.

512
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,781
Let's get this thing
in the trunk.

513
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,817
I can't decide if I'm feeling
more proud or mortified.

514
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:58,254
Gloria:
How about now?

515
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,465
Jay: We tell our kids it doesn't
matter if you win or lose,

516
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,634
But let's be honest.

517
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:14,871
Winning feels pretty great.

518
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:19,308
There's nothing like
that golden moment in the sun.

519
00:19:19,376 --> 00:19:20,743
[ laughs ]

520
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,980
I think every parent probably
wants that for their child.

521
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:28,951
You know, maybe a little bit
for ourselves, too.

522
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:30,687
[ laughing ] buddy!

523
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,222
So, sometimes,
we push too hard.

524
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,092
And that leads to a lot
of resentment and guilt.

525
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,560
Yes!

526
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:39,395
So, how much is too much?

527
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:41,230
<i>Here's where I come out.</i>

528
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:43,433
Guilt fades.

529
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,969
Hardware is forever.

530
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:55,712
You're mad,
aren't you?

531
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,713
I'm not mad.

532
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:57,981
Yes, you are.
No, I am not.

533
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,283
You're
a little jealous.

534
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,152
I'm...Happy
for the two of you.

535
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,587
All right, come on.
We'll do one.

536
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:04,521
Stay there.

537
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:05,889
For real?
Yep.

538
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,034
Feel better?
Yeah.

539
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:18,435
Oh, do me now.
Come on.

540
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,703
What are you
talking about?

541
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,105
Are you serious?

542
00:20:23,274 --> 00:20:25,242
Cam, no! Ow!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
