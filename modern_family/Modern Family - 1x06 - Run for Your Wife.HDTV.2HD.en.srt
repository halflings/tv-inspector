He's right.
It looked like a snake.

I can't believe my littlboy
is going into the fifth grade.

28
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,660
He used to hold my finger
with his little hand

29

What are you
wearing there?

36
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,377
That looks like
an old christmas tree skirt.

37
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,479
It's a traditional
colombian poncho.

Why is our daughter
dressed like donna summer?

47

She is not donna summer.

48

Clearly, she's diana ross
from the rca years.

How is daddy
not seeing that?

Of her dressed

00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:41,643
Yeah, I know.
That's why it's funny.

161
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,878
Moo!
I don't think it's as funny
as you think it is.

162
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,847
Can we please just call
your sister?
No, no.

163
00:05:45,915 --> 00:05:48,316
Cam, cam, why, so she
can be all judgmental
and condescending,

164
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:51,052
Like she's the expert
and I don't know how to
take care of a baby?

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,221
Mitchell,
she is your family.

166
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,991
Of course she's gonna be
judgmental and condescending.

167
00:05:57,059 --> 00:05:58,493
Hello?

168
00:05:58,561 --> 00:05:59,828
Hey, hi.

169
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:01,596
Uh, not a big deal,
just wondering --

170
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:03,832
When your kids were small,
did you ever...

171
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,134
I don't know, uh,
smack their heads into a wall?

172
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:08,169
Usually,
we just gave time-outs.

173
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,337
No, no. Accidentally.

174
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:11,473
Um, we -- we just kind of
bonked lily's head,

175
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,441
And she --
it really wasn't very hard,

176
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:15,310
And she's not acting
any differently,

177
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:16,811
But I just worry --
relax.

178
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,179
It happens.

179
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,249
Luke used to bang his head
all the time, and he's fine.

180
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,784
Okay.
All right, thank you.

181
00:06:22,852 --> 00:06:24,419
Thanks. That helps.
Okay, okay.

182
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,154
We got to take her
to the doctor.

183
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:27,555
Load up the car.

184
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,158
Jay: Gloria?

185
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:32,093
I'm here.

186
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:35,263
I, uh, just dropped manny off
at school,

187
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,332
And I realized...

188
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,501
I just dropped manny off
at school.

189
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:40,869
Oh, boy.

190
00:06:40,936 --> 00:06:43,738
And I was hoping we'd still have
a few more good years

191
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:45,306
Before the mind
started to go.

192
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,674
No, what I'm saying...

193
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:49,644
We have the day to ourselves
for the first time in months.

194
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:51,379
We should
take advantage of it --

195
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:53,081
Go to the club...

196
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,849
Nice lunch...

197
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:56,184
Some massages.

198
00:06:56,252 --> 00:06:57,552
What about work?

199
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,920
I'm the boss.

200
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:02,724
Since I married you,
people are surprised
I come in at all.

201
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,792
[ chuckles ]

202
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:05,660
Jay's very spontaneous.

203
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:09,197
He's always surprising me
with little presents,

204
00:07:09,265 --> 00:07:10,498
Fun getaways.

205
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,534
I wasn't the greatest husband
the first time around,

206
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:14,602
But I'm trying to do better
this time.

207
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,906
And maybe by my third marriage,
I'll have it down pat.

208
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,107
[ chuckles ]

209
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:23,378
Yeah, that one's
gonna cost me.

210
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:29,050
Whatcha reading there,
a book?

211
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:31,186
Yeah, I've been meaning
to get to it for a while.

212
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,854
Oh, it's got a map
at the beginning.

213
00:07:32,922 --> 00:07:34,189
I like it
when books do that.

214
00:07:34,256 --> 00:07:35,423
Uh-huh.

215
00:07:36,926 --> 00:07:39,194
Do you have an open house
this morning?

216
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,195
I rescheduled.

217
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:43,264
Thought you might like
some company.

218
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,465
Ahh.

219
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,000
Phil: Well, the first day
of school can be tough

220
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,268
For stay-at-home moms.

221
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,737
Now, you have to understand --
the kids are gone,

222
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:53,208
The nest is empty,
they are rudderless.

223
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:56,811
And a lot of guys
wouldn't even notice.

224
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,247
But I'm not a lot of guys.

225
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,816
I listen with my mind,
and if you pay attention,

226
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:03,651
Women will tell you
what they want

227
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:06,054
By telling you the opposite
of what they want.

228
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:08,122
Like, the other day,
claire was like,

229
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,524
"you have to move your car.

230
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:12,260
There's no space in the garage
for both of our cars."

231
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:14,729
And what she's really saying
is that, you know,

232
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,831
I should probably get
a sports car.

233
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:20,668
I was sort of looking forward
to a quiet day.

234
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:23,471
Thought I'd just read,
maybe...Go for a run later.

235
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:24,706
That's it.

236
00:08:24,773 --> 00:08:26,374
Great.
We'll run together.

237
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,143
You don't
have to do that.

238
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,378
Know.

239
00:08:35,084 --> 00:08:37,385
Listening.

240
00:08:37,453 --> 00:08:39,520
The thing is,
I like to run alone,

241
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:42,223
And I run kind of fast,
so...

242
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,191
So...

243
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,559
So, I'm not sure

244
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,628
You're gonna be able
to keep up with me.

245
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,296
[ laughs ]

246
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:50,765
You're k--
you're kidding, right?
No.

247
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,100
You really think
I can't keep up with you?

248
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,335
I'm not sure you can keep up
with this conversation.

249
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,437
I think you're forgetting
that I power-walk every morning

250
00:08:56,505 --> 00:08:59,307
And that I wear my special ses
with the big soles,

251
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,910
Which were designed
by a doctor.

252
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:03,011
Yes, I know.

253
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,146
<i>But I run...
Every day.</i>

254
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:07,782
You really think you can run
as fast as me?

255
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,319
No, phil, I think I can run
much, much faster...

256
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:13,655
...Than you.

257
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:24,732
Boom.

258
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,001
Just like that,
the whole day changed.

259
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,069
It was game on.

260
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,338
She knew it. I knew it.
We both knew it.

261
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:31,439
[ sighs ]

262
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:33,508
I just want to read.

263
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,010
I think I'll order
what I had the last time.

264
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:35,711
What was that called?

265
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,747
You just want me to
say it because you want
me to roll my r's.

266
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,215
Come on!
[ trilling ]
reuben.

267
00:09:40,283 --> 00:09:41,183
[ laughs ]

268
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,737
Jay, what is this?

269
00:09:45,805 --> 00:09:47,372
Oh, looks like
my old car cover.

270
00:09:47,439 --> 00:09:49,174
Don't give me that.
This is manny's poncho.

271
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,542
What is it doing here?

272
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:52,577
Maybe he decided to take it off
on the way to school.

273
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:54,312
What did you say to him?
Nothing.

274
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,014
I told some jokes.

275
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:58,349
<i>You said plenty
with your jokes.</i>

276
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,984
Jay, he looks up to you.

277
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,753
He respects your opinion.

278
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,288
We dodged a bullet on this,
trust me.

279
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:04,956
I've been
down this road before.

280
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:07,492
I remember one time
mitchell decided to wear

281
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,927
A jaunty scarf to school.

282
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:10,228
I kept my mouth shut.

283
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:11,930
He got
his jaunty butt kicked.

284
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:15,066
My dad has this perception that
I was very flamboyant as a kid,

285
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,801
Which is just --
it's nonsense,

286
00:10:16,869 --> 00:10:19,437
Because I kept the whole
gay thing very under wraps.

287
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:22,073
You know,
I was just a guy's guy.

288
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:24,175
I-I was basically a jock.

289
00:10:24,243 --> 00:10:27,145
You know?

290
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:28,947
So, we should crush
manny's spirit

291
00:10:29,014 --> 00:10:31,482
And destroy everything
that makes him who he is.

292
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,284
I'm just sing,
it's no fun

293
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:35,453
To see your kid
get picked on every day,

294
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,555
Getting tormented
just because he's different.

295
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:39,724
Now, I'm telling you,
it rips your heart out.

296
00:10:39,792 --> 00:10:43,127
Well, batman doesn't get
picked on, and he wears a cape.

297
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,397
A poncho is just a cape
that goes all the way around.

298
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:49,534
Batman doesn't get picked on
because he's a muscular genius.

299
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,636
Manny can't make it
to the top bunk.

300
00:10:51,704 --> 00:10:53,538
We're taking this poncho
to manny at school.

301
00:10:53,606 --> 00:10:56,274
It's important that he knows
that we support m.

302
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:00,578
And then we go get
those massages.

303
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,447
That sounded good.

304
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:08,186
I always take the stairs
two at a time.

305
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:10,021
I don't even think about it
anymore.

306
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:11,923
The regular way
would seem weird.

307
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,958
Phil, let it go.
I'm faster than you.

308
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:16,327
If only there was some way
we could settle this

309
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:19,597
Once and for all,
but how?

310
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,299
Huh.

311
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,234
You seriously
want to race me?

312
00:11:23,302 --> 00:11:25,303
I ran a half marathon
last year.

313
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:27,372
Wow. I'm half scared.

314
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:28,640
<i>Okay,
we do need to do this.</i>

315
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:29,841
I'll go change.

316
00:11:29,909 --> 00:11:31,509
Not now.
I got a conference call.

317
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:32,810
But how about after that?

318
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:34,045
Great. This afternoon.

319
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:36,514
Sweet!

320
00:11:36,582 --> 00:11:38,750
Two at a time,
two at a time, two at a --

321
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:40,818
Son of a gun,
got to fix that step.

322
00:11:40,886 --> 00:11:43,087
Two at a time,
already at the top, so...

323
00:11:44,423 --> 00:11:46,891
Hi.
I'm dr. Miura.

324
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,259
I'm on call today.

325
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,028
Looks like we have
a little head bump.

326
00:11:50,095 --> 00:11:53,031
Yeah, it happened a couple hours
ago on a doorjamb.

327
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:54,532
Oh, ouch.

328
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,967
We used to do this thing
in school

329
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:57,602
Where they would give you
an egg,

330
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,771
And you -- you know,
you couldn't break it.

331
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:02,674
And it was supposed to teach you
how hard it was to be a parent.

332
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:03,975
But...

333
00:12:04,043 --> 00:12:07,612
The real thing, it's --
it's -- it's so much harder.

334
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,847
We did that
in my school, too.

335
00:12:09,915 --> 00:12:11,716
It didn't turn out
so well.

336
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,584
Went through a dozen eggs.

337
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:15,553
Yeah, well,
he's a nervous eater.

338
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,722
<i>No, I broke
a dozen eggs.
Oh.</i>

339
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,359
I'm sorry.
I just assumed that --

340
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:22,593
I know.

341
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:24,729
I know
what you assumed.

342
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:28,232
There doesn't seem to be
any mark.

343
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,768
Well, her head was...
Somewhat protected.

344
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:31,802
Protected?

345
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,404
Was she wearing
a hat?

346
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:34,905
Yes, yes.
It was like a hat.

347
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:36,173
It was a wig.

348
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:39,043
Actually, sort of
a ghetto-fabulous afro thing.

349
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,078
I thought it might be
medically relevant.

350
00:12:41,146 --> 00:12:41,513
Really?

351
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:44,383
You thought "ghetto-fabulous"
might be medically relevant?

352
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,518
Maybe I should just finish
with the exam?

353
00:12:46,586 --> 00:12:47,686
Yes. Thanks.

354
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,154
You'll be pleased to know

355
00:12:49,222 --> 00:12:51,757
That mitchell and I
intend on raising lily

356
00:12:51,824 --> 00:12:54,192
With influences
from her asian heritage.

357
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,995
That is fantastic.

358
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,664
Have you noticed any vomiting
since the head bump?

359
00:12:59,732 --> 00:13:00,865
Uh, no. No, no.

360
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,934
We've hung some art in her room,
some asian art,

361
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,169
And then when she's ready
for solid food,

362
00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:06,938
There is a fantastic
pho place

363
00:13:07,006 --> 00:13:09,073
Right around the corner
from our house.

364
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:11,109
Am I pronouncing that
right?

365
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:13,444
Is it "pho"?
[fuh]

366
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,879
It's a soup.

367
00:13:14,947 --> 00:13:16,614
I don't know.

368
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:18,549
I'm from denver.

369
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:22,387
We don't have
a lot of...Pho there.

370
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:24,422
Just to be sure,

371
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,458
Could you show me
how hard lily got hit?

372
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,093
And u-- use your head.

373
00:13:29,161 --> 00:13:32,030
Oh, yeah, so, I mean,
really, it was...

374
00:13:32,097 --> 00:13:34,632
It was just
sort of like, um...

375
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,734
Could I see that
again?

376
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:39,804
Um, it was just --
just a head bump, you know?

377
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,439
How are you feeling?

378
00:13:41,507 --> 00:13:42,707
Uh, fine.

379
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:43,908
So is lily.

380
00:13:44,376 --> 00:13:47,044
Babies are designed
to survive new parents.

381
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:49,847
So stop worrying.
You guys are doing great.

382
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,715
Thank you.

383
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:55,486
Denver.

384
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,543
I don't see any ponchos,

385
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:08,712
Which means either the kids
don't wear them

386
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,614
<i>Or the ones who do wear them
disappear.</i>

387
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,116
We're doing
the right thing.

388
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,951
I support manny
no matter what.

389
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,453
Children need to know
that you believe in them.

390
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:18,255
It's the most
important thing.

391
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,190
If you tell them
they have wings,

392
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:21,992
They will believe
they can fly.

393
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,160
Oh, really?

394
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,562
I had a buddy
went to woodstock,

395
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,098
Believed he could fly --
didn't end great.

396
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,968
It's why hotel windows
don't open anymore.

397
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,772
Is something wrong?
Who's died?

398
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:35,873
No one, manny.

399
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,508
Why would you even
think that?

400
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:40,444
In colombia, manny went to
pablo escobar elementary school.

401
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,346
If you were
pulled out of class,

402
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,381
It was definitely
to identify a body.

403
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:45,716
Well, we got
your poncho here.

404
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,351
I thought you said
it made me look like

405
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,619
My neck
was wearing a dress.

406
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,653
That was a joke.

407
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,954
Oh, good
it's still in the pocket.

408
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:52,389
What do you got there,
buddy?

409
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:53,524
My pan flute.

410
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,125
I'm going to play
some colombian folk music

411
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:56,193
For my new classmates.

412
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:57,361
Huh. Great.

413
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,698
I've never been
more proud of you.

414
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:03,333
I'm sure your friends
are gonna love it.

415
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,935
Break the flute.
What?

416
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:07,371
The poncho by itself
is fine.

417
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:11,075
The poncho plus the flute
plus the stupid dance --

418
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,544
My son will die a virgin.

419
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,012
That's right.

420
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,148
Hey, sport, can I take a look
at that whistle?

421
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,718
Oh, geez,
look at that!

422
00:15:20,785 --> 00:15:22,920
And now you stepped
on it!
What?

423
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:26,757
Oh, darn!
Wh-what's wrong with me?!

424
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,526
Here, let me get it.

425
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:30,761
Thank you.

426
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,896
You know what, actually,
maybe you should do this.

427
00:15:32,964 --> 00:15:34,865
Why?
I-I don't want to
bump her head against the door,

428
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,600
You know,
pinch her with the seat belt.

429
00:15:36,668 --> 00:15:39,403
Mitchell, how long are
you gonna beat yourself
up over one mistake?

430
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,672
Is this gonna be like the bld
highlights all over again?

431
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,673
I just...

432
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,675
I think I suck
at being a father.

433
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:46,310
What are you
talking about?

434
00:15:46,377 --> 00:15:47,444
We're new at this.

435
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:48,912
Yeah, but you're such
a natural.

436
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,013
I mean, look at you.

437
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:51,648
You walk into the room,
and she lights up.

438
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,584
You -- you change her diaper
with one hand.

439
00:15:53,651 --> 00:15:54,785
I -- nice.

440
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,553
I'm actually jealous
of you.

441
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,456
There are so many things
that you do that I can't.

442
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:01,892
You -- you baby-proofed
the entire house.

443
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,261
You took care of all
the adoption paperwork.

444
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,497
Without you, we wouldn't even
have a baby to injure.

445
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,598
Just a couple of forms.

446
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,433
Actually,
that was a lot of paperwork.

447
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,802
And you got her on all those
preschool waiting lists.

448
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,471
<i>I can't believe you
were gonna wait until
she was old enough.</i>

449
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:16,840
You see, that's what makes us
a great team.

450
00:16:16,908 --> 00:16:18,675
We each have
our own strengths.

451
00:16:18,743 --> 00:16:20,344
Now...

452
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:21,945
Who are
amazing parents?

453
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,547
We are.
I can't hear you.

454
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:24,681
We are!

455
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,950
Don't you forget it.
Okay.

456
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,755
Did we just lock our baby
in the car?

457
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,056
Did you put the keys
in the bag?!

458
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,825
I put the keys in the bag.
That's what we always --

459
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:36,727
Oh, mitchell, I told you not to
put the keys in the bag!

460
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,195
Don't freak out.
Come on, don't freak out!

461
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,429
Lily, it's okay!

462
00:16:39,497 --> 00:16:40,397
* a, b, c, d,
e, f, g *

463
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,032
What,
are you singing to her?

464
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,001
People get arrested
for this, mitchell!
We have to keep her calm.

465
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:47,237
* h, I, j, k,
l, m, n, o, p *

466
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:49,506
Do all four doors lock?!
Do you have a phone?!

467
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,009
[ dance music playing ]
what?

468
00:16:52,076 --> 00:16:53,277
I didn't say anything.

469
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:55,512
I couldn't hear you.
I'm cranking one of my mash-ups.

470
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,014
Oh.

471
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,215
Hey, hey!

472
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,383
There they are.

473
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,985
How was the first day
back in prison?

474

Are you?
I was born ready.

I swear to god,

You'll get glass on her!

How did they do that?

I don't know.
It's just --

Did that come
from space?

I run five miles a day.

I have a resting heart rate
of 48.

<i>The first day of school
is tough on all my kids,</i>

You're getting better,

Did I lose the race
to make him feel better?

Maybe.

But we never stop wanting
the best for them.

That's what makes it
such a tough job...
