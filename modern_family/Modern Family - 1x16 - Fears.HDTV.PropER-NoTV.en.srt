1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:03,305
Hmm, let's see.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,907
Global warming.

3
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:06,375
And getting a "b."

4
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:09,258
The phone ringing in the
middle of the night.

5
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,726
That I'm too much
of a perfectionist.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,089
Honey, this isn't a job interview.

7
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:16,257
Oh, man.

8
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,188
Job interviews.

9
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:19,522
Nothing.

10
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:21,428
Yeah, right.
What about the pigeons?

11
00:00:21,462 --> 00:00:23,204
Oh, I don't like them.

12
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,509
They're shifty.

13
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:25,743
Losing mitchell.

14
00:00:25,777 --> 00:00:28,219
Oh!

15
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,921
Hotel bedspreads.

16
00:00:30,955 --> 00:00:33,062
Never getting my driver's license.

17
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:35,566
Or getting one and
the picture sucks.

18
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,404
Dying alone.

19
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,005
Oh, haley, sweetie,
did you find your shoes?

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,140
Mom, please, not today.

21
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:43,876
I just wanted to know
if you found your shoes.

22
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,713
Why are you hounding me?
I'm freaking out right now!

23
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:49,051
You need to relax.
It's just a driver's test.

24
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:51,853
It's my third driver's test,
and if I fail again,

25
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,322
I have to wait six
months to retake it.

26
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:57,591
That's six more months of
you driving me everywhere.

27
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:59,325
And then I'm like,
"there's no way I'm wearing that."

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,062
And she was like, "well, if you don't
wear it, then you can't play." "like."

29
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,332
And then I was like, "well, you know what?
That's fine by me." honey, "like."

30
00:01:04,366 --> 00:01:06,702
And she was like, "well, if you don't play,
then --" "like." "like."

31
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,404
Mom! Mom! Stop! Stop
saying "like" all the time!

32
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,107
You're embarrassing me! Stop it!! Like,
like, like, like, like! Aah!

33
00:01:11,142 --> 00:01:12,510
Mm.

34
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:14,814
Haley, found your jacket.

35
00:01:14,848 --> 00:01:17,284
Why is everyone on me?!

36
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,285
God!

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,620
Ignore her.

38
00:01:19,654 --> 00:01:21,255
She can't focus on
two things at once.

39
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,891
Always a good quality in a driver.

40
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:26,427
Sweetie, we need to get you some
shoes for the dance tonight.

41
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,995
No, we don't. I'm not going.

42
00:01:28,029 --> 00:01:29,196
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,931
Why would you not be
going to the dance?

44
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,033
Because school dances are lame.

45
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,768
A bunch of immature boys

46
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:36,769
Trying to impress you
with how cool they are

47
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,571
When they're really
just a bunch of dorks.

48
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:42,942
ready to go down under, mate? Yes.

49
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:44,811
What are you doing?

50
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:46,446
Treasure hunting. Treasure hunting.

51
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,981
Wow.

52
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:50,585
a few days ago, the cable
guy was under the house.

53
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,053
When he was leaving,
he said to haley,

54
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:55,824
"wow, that's quite a collection
you've got down there."

55
00:01:55,858 --> 00:01:59,829
Here's the thing -- we have no
idea what he's talking about.

56
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:02,600
All week, luke and I have been
getting more and more excited

57
00:02:02,634 --> 00:02:04,001
About what it could be.

58
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,771
I bet it's really
cool old magazines.

59
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:07,972
Yeah.

60
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:10,575
Or a bunch of necklaces
made out of animal teeth.

61
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,944
Or bugs frozen in amber.

62
00:02:12,978 --> 00:02:15,881
What if it's really
expensive bottles of wine?

63
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,115
Or a suit of armor.

64
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:21,186
What if there's ancient
indian arrowheads under there?

65
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,988
What if it's gold bars?

66
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,356
Oh, you think?

67
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,992
For god's sakes, why don't you
go under the house and look?

68
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:39,463
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

69
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,479
Hey, cam. Cam, where did
we get this dolly from?

70
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:49,781
Oh, from janice and olivia.
They brought it over yesterday.

71
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,082
Lily loves it.

72
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:53,519
It seems a little frilly,
you know, coming from them.

73
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,087
What, because they're lesbians?

74
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:57,556
That's sort of an offensive
stereotype, don't you think?

75
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,991
Yeah, I suppose. I'm sorry.

76
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,160
Oh, hey, did they bring
back our coffee maker?

77
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,198
Nwe got off to an awkward start
they werewith our pediatrician,

78
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,400
A very nice asian
lady - irrelevant.

79
00:03:08,434 --> 00:03:09,635
...Named dr. Miura,

80
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,404
So I took the bold step of
inviting her over for brunch.

81
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,372
I'm sorry, uh, "bold"?

82
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,741
She said no patient had
ever done it before.

83
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:19,344
Yeah, subtext -- "this is weird."

84
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:21,513
I didn't hear any subtext.

85
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:23,648
Do you hear any now?

86
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:27,619
I don't even know why
we're doing this.

87
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:30,857
Because what if lily gets sick
and there's a tamiflu shortage?

88
00:03:30,891 --> 00:03:32,659
Who do you think's gonna
get that medicine?

89
00:03:32,693 --> 00:03:34,194
The patients she likes, that's who.

90
00:03:34,228 --> 00:03:35,930
Well, maybe if you bake her a cake,

91
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:37,164
She'll give us free x-rays.

92
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,733
It's all about making connections.

93
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,002
Why do you think the dentist
gives me all that free stuff?

94
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:43,539
Um, because he's a huge queen
and he has a big crush on you.

95
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,643
Really? Do you think so?

96
00:03:48,078 --> 00:03:49,446
Mom? Gloria: Hmm?

97
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:50,515
I have a fever.

98
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,117
<i>Ay, mi amor, come here,
and I feel you.</i>

99
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,453
Oh, I don't want you to get you sick.
It could be fatal.

100
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,221
Then by all means,
stand next to me.

101
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:58,789
Let me feel you.

102
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,394
<i>Ay, papi, but you're not warm.</i>

103
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:04,763
Uh, probably because
you were cooking

104
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,098
And your hands are warm.

105
00:04:06,132 --> 00:04:09,302
I'd better skip the party
tomorrow just to be safe.

106
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,971
Oh, yeah, the party.

107
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:14,341
What?

108
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,976
The party.

109
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,213
I understand about 20% of
what goes on around here.

110
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,315
The party is at an amusement park,

111
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,750
And manny is afraid
of roller coasters.

112
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:24,818
Poor kid.

113
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,520
I don't know where he
gets his fear from,

114
00:04:26,555 --> 00:04:28,422
Because his father's not
afraid of anything --

115
00:04:28,456 --> 00:04:31,325
No bulls, no heights,
no helicopters, no fast cars.

116
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,394
But go to dinner with him and
wait for the check to come.

117
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:36,463
Then you'll see fear in his eyes --

118
00:04:36,497 --> 00:04:39,299
Like the waiter's a ghost.

119
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:40,767
Excited?

120
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:41,835
Yeah.

121
00:04:41,869 --> 00:04:44,203
We're like ponce de
leun and his son.

122
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:45,772
Little ponce.

123
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:47,206
Who's that?

124
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:49,141
Famous treasure hunters.

125
00:04:49,176 --> 00:04:50,876
His name was ponce?

126
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:52,945
He'd get made fun of at my school.

127
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:54,413
They'd probably call him "pants."

128
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:57,550
"pants."

129
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,985
Or maybe, um, "fancy ponce."

130
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,521
that's a good one.

131
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,622
All right.

132
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:05,290
Let's do this.

133
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:07,593
Animal chittering ] oh, hey, wow.

134
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:09,461
You okay, dad? Yeah.

135
00:05:09,496 --> 00:05:10,729
Yeah, I am. Yep.

136
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,664
Gonna take a little more
than getting trapped

137
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,532
In a small, dark space
with a wild animal

138
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,100
To rattle your old man. All right.

139
00:05:16,134 --> 00:05:18,068
You never want your
kids to see you scared.

140
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,370
You want to be that rock

141
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,839
That they can grab ahold
of in a stormy sea.

142
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:25,376
Actually, a rock would sink,
so a floating rock.

143
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,577
Let's start over.

144
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,748
It's windy, and you've
got a lot of papers.

145
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:33,051
Okay. Let's do this, buddy.

146
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:38,691
okay, good recon.

147
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,693
Got the lay of the land, so...

148
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,394
Aren't we going in? Yep.

149
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,363
We are, but won't it be fun

150
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:47,966
If we did it with ski
goggles and barbecue tools?

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,901
I guess. Yeah.

152
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,502
Yeah, let's do that.

153
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:52,970
All right.

154
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,707
Can I just say,
that is a lovely outfit?

155
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:58,942
Oh, thank you.

156
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,810
Well, it's just nice to see
you out of your lab coat.

157
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,512
You actually have
quite a nice figure.

158
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:03,480
Take it down a notch.

159
00:06:03,514 --> 00:06:05,048
We're just trying to make a friend,

160
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:06,249
Not initiate a three-way.

161
00:06:07,418 --> 00:06:09,853
Oh.

162
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,421
Lily looks great.

163
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,523
Do you think so?
Shouldn't she have more teeth?

164
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:15,525
I see these kids running
around at the park,

165
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,660
And they look like sharks.

166
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:18,728
Don't worry. She's perfect.

167
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:19,930
Aren't you, lily?

168
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:22,366
Oh, look how calm she is with you.

169
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,068
She's usually very fidgety
around new people.

170
00:06:24,102 --> 00:06:25,269
Well, I just think she senses

171
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,736
You're gonna be a
good friend for her

172
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:30,040
During in good times
and - and flu season.

173
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,909
Mommy!

174
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:36,915
Did shjust -- did she just say...

175
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:37,982
Oh.

176
00:06:38,017 --> 00:06:39,284
Well

177
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:42,420
Her first word was every gay
father's worst nightmare.

178
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:44,322
mommy. Oh.

179
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:49,972
But I know that manny's sad
because he's missing the party.

180
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,574
Why don't we take him somewhere
to take his mind off it, hmm?

181
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:54,477
I could have guessed he'd have
trouble with roller coasters.

182
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:56,045
That kid gets woozy at barbershops

183
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,914
When they spin his chair
towards the mirror.

184
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,316
How about we take him to the
pier and go fishing, huh?

185
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:01,284
Manny!

186
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:03,352
He likes to fish? Yeah.

187
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:06,622
He comes from a long line
of fishermen and smugglers.

188
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,623
But I encourage the fishing.

189
00:07:08,658 --> 00:07:10,025
Manny, you like to fish?

190
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:11,226
Fishing? Yeah.

191
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,361
You want to go to the pietoday?

192
00:07:13,396 --> 00:07:16,030
Is this a trick to see
if I'm really sick?

193
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:19,934
No, maybe the fresh air
will make you feel better.

194
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:21,302
Well, then, yeah,

195
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,271
'cause there's no place where
I'm more at one with --

196
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:24,739
Just get your coat.

197
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:26,741
Are you nervous? Shut up, alex.

198
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:27,841
I was just asking.

199
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,143
I'd be nervous if I were you.

200
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:31,245
Alex, leave your sister alone.
She's gonna be fine.

201
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,147
As long as I don't
get the same guy.

202
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:34,915
He's so mean! You probably will.

203
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,283
You won't. He hates me.

204
00:07:36,317 --> 00:07:38,553
He doesn't hate you.
He yelled at me.

205
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:39,787
You drove into the bushes.

206
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:40,921
Oh, no, it's him.

207
00:07:40,956 --> 00:07:42,757
Please don't be for me.
Please don't be for me.

208
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,625
Please don't be for me.
Please don't be for me.

209
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,961
Hi.

210
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:49,063
Oh, thank god.

211
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:51,099
Well, come on.

212
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,933
I don't have all day.

213
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,569
I'm gonna throw up.

214
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:56,070
Okay, no. This is
what you're gonna do.

215
00:07:56,104 --> 00:07:58,505
You're gonna get in that car,
put on your seat belt,

216
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,440
And take three deep
breaths and relax.

217
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:02,009
This guy sees hundreds
of kids every day.

218
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,711
He probably doesn't even
remember you, all right?

219
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:05,078
Okay. Okay.

220
00:08:05,113 --> 00:08:07,782
Yo! Let'move it, two strikes.

221
00:08:11,052 --> 00:08:13,020
That's more than
three breaths, honey.

222
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:17,291
See how much better this is?

223
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,926
The truck goes in, it gets video,

224
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:21,095
And then we get a preview
of whatever's in there.

225
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,363
How ingenious is that, huh

226
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:24,766
Are you too scared to go in?

227
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,401
Why would you say that?

228
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:29,437
Well, when you stuck your head in,
you screamed a little.

229
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:31,640
I told you, that was
the house settling.

230
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:34,142
Besides, this is so much cooler.

231
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:35,777
This is how nasa does it.

232
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,414
Now, hand me the
itty bitty booklight.

233
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:39,849
Yeah.

234
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,385
Final piece of the puzzle.

235
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:46,489
Blast off!

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,060
Hey, dad?

237
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:51,961
Yeah?

238
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:53,363
How are you supposed to steer

239
00:08:53,397 --> 00:08:55,064
If you don't know
where you're going?

240
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,232
Stay in the present, buddy.

241
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:58,134
Got to do it by feel.

242
00:08:58,168 --> 00:09:01,337
You got to get all jedi on it.

243
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:13,382
Uh-oh.

244
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,351
Did you just lose my truck? No.

245
00:09:15,385 --> 00:09:16,852
You just lost my truck! No,
I didn't!

246
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:18,787
That w my truck!
Grandpa just gave it to me!

247
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,455
I told you to stay in the present!

248
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,957
Stop yelling!

249
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:26,295
Truce?

250
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:28,898
Yeah, sorry.

251
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,001
This is delicis. Oh, thank you.

252
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,738
<i>The recipe's from the now-defunct
gourmet magazine.</i>

253
00:09:35,772 --> 00:09:38,340
Why do all the things
I love go away?

254
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:43,913
Look, I don't even think
she said the "m" word.

255
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,581
No, we heard it.
It was clear as day.

256
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:48,251
I-I just don't know
what we've done wrong.

257
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,454
I quit my job so I could
stay at home with her,

258
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,155
But maybe it's not enough.

259
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,291
maybe we're not providing her

260
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:58,360
With the feminine
energy that she needs.

261
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,732
Yeah, I wouldn't be too
concerned about that.

262
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:06,101
You -- you know it's because you're asian,
right? Mitchell: Cam!

263
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:07,069
No, I'm sorry.

264
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,204
What, am I just supposed to ignore

265
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,640
The giant panda in the room?

266
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,408
Pandas are from china.

267
00:10:13,443 --> 00:10:14,876
I -- well, it doesn't matter.

268
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,211
Okay, okay, um,

269
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,379
I think what my hysterical
partner is just trying to say --

270
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:19,480
And if I may --

271
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,415
That for the first six
months of her life,

272
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,418
Lily was raised by
very loving asian women

273
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:27,854
In an orphanage, with whom
she clearly bonded, you know.

274
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:30,590
And then suddenly you come
in with all of your...

275
00:10:30,624 --> 00:10:34,193
Asian-ness and -- and - and
breasts and womb, lady bits,

276
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:37,329
And it -- it all just comes
rushing back to -- to her,

277
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,496
And...

278
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,798
You guys are overreacting.

279
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,533
I'm sure lily just strung

280
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,269
A couple of random syllables togeer

281
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:48,472
And they happened to sound
something like that word,

282
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,540
But that's all.

283
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:53,744
Do -- do you really think that?

284
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,179
Of course! Yeah,
she -- she's right.

285
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,013
She's right.
We're being ridiculous.

286
00:10:57,048 --> 00:10:58,382
We're being ridiculous.

287
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,185
Your daddies are being ridiculous.

288
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,087
Mommy!

289
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,590
Okay.

290
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,192
Mr. Tucker?

291
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:09,595
No, no, she's -
she's - she's made her choice.

292
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:10,696
She's made her choice.

293
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,131
Uh, left turn.

294
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,132
Here?

295
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,700
At the intersection, yeah.

296
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:16,502
Okay.

297
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:17,770
Left.

298
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:18,937
What?

299
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,906
I said, "left." you're going right.

300
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,807
Wait! No, wait! I'm trying, okay?!

301
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:23,841
Pull over.

302
00:11:23,876 --> 00:11:25,276
No, I can do this!

303
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,744
Pull over now!

304
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,280
Why are you crying?

305
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,782
why do you hate me?

306
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:32,816
Oh, hell.

307
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,218
Haley, I don't hate you.

308
00:11:35,253 --> 00:11:36,853
You seem like a nice girl.

309
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:38,321
You remind me of my daughter,

310
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,191
Which is why I want you to
live a long and happy life

311
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,726
And be safe.

312
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,529
And not hurt my daughter.

313
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,931
I really want my license.

314
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,468
I've been practicing a lot,
I swear.

315
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,403
You gonna drink and drive? No, sir.

316
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,840
You gonna text and drive? No, sir.

317
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:56,808
All right.

318
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:59,678
Let's start this
from the beginning.

319
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:02,280
Could you smile first?

320
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,182
I'll be less nervous if you smile.

321
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,754
Okay, that didn't help.

322
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,356
Just go.

323
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:21,062
Today feels like a
good day for halibut.

324
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:23,031
Hey, jay, did I ever tell you

325
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:24,899
About the time I used peanut
butter and jelly for bait

326
00:12:26,735 --> 00:12:29,170
And I caught a thresher shark?
You tell me a lot of funny things.

327
00:12:29,204 --> 00:12:31,238
Why are we going this way?

328
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:33,207
It's just another way to .

329
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:34,976
Uh-oh. Something's going on.

330
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,845
What are you talking about?
Wake up, old man.

331
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,047
She's trying to get me
on that roller coaster.

332
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:42,816
No, she's not.

333
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,484
Yes, I am. What?

334
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,519
Told y.

335
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,954
Manny, you have to face your fears.

336
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:49,288
That's why we're here?

337
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,390
But y didn't you let me
in on your little plan?

338
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:52,758
Because you're the worst liar.

339
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,326
He would have seen
right through you.

340
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,094
I don't want to go on
the roller coaster.

341
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,929
Manny, you were afraid
to light the barbecue,

342
00:12:57,964 --> 00:13:00,565
But now your eyebrows
have grown back

343
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,801
And your salmon is legendary.

344
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,236
What if fall out?

345
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,537
I will catch you.

346
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,272
That's not possible.
He would crush you.

347
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,707
W-what if I throw up?

348
00:13:08,742 --> 00:13:11,877
I will clean it up.
It wouldn't be the first time.

349
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,380
Ah, geez, these are new shoes.

350
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:15,749
You're not gonna let up, are you?

351
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,485
Baby, I think you know the answer.

352
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,121
fine, let's get it over with.

353
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:24,122
that's my boy!

354
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:25,357
<i>Vamos, jay.</i>

355
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:28,159
No, I'm not going on that.
That's bad for my back.

356
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:29,226
Your back is fine.

357
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:31,095
Yeah, I got an inner-ear thing.

358
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:33,296
Oh, please. Don't tell
me you're scared, too.

359
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:35,399
Scared? What - what
is this scared stuff?

360
00:13:35,433 --> 00:13:37,600
What -- what am I,
a child? I'm not scared.

361
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,636
You see? You're the worst liar.

362
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,305
Well, if he's not going,
I'm not going.

363
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:45,341
Oh, for god's sake, fine.
I'll go alone.

364
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:47,845
Here, take my girly purse.

365
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:49,279
And you, my floppy hat.

366
00:13:49,314 --> 00:13:52,081
And if you need it,
there's the ladies' room.

367
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:56,886
I'm not man enough to fight this.

368
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:00,323
Here, hold my purse.

369
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,262
Oh, hell!

370
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,653
You know, honey, I think I know

371
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,122
Why you don't want to go tonight.

372
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,557
Because school dances are lame?

373
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,425
No, 'cause you don't
know how to dance.

374
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,593
That's not it.

375
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,028
I can help you with that.
Come on. Oh, god. No!

376
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,196
Come on. No! Mom!

377
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,498
Oh, yeah, back in the day,
I was quite the dancer.

378
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,835
Oh, my god, you and dad together
suddenly makes so much sense.

379
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,937
Mom! Mom, stop! Stop!

380
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,940
Please, stop. I know how to dance.

381
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,309
I just don't want to be
part of that freak show.

382
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,310
Sweetheart, you're a beautiful gir

383
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,045
Someone ll ask you to dance.

384
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,114
I know that. It's just stupid.

385
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,716
Somebody will ask you.

386
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,084
Why do you keep saying that?

387
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,853
Somebody will ask you.

388
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,623
But what if they don't?

389
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,858
Honey, if they don't,

390
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,061
Then you do the exact same
thing I told your sister, okay?

391
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,698
Take three deep breaths and relax.

392
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,867
Even the advice I get
is a hand-me-down.

393
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,602
Mom, I did it!

394
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,903
I passed!

395
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:05,104
Aah! Oh, my god!

396
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:06,305
I got my license!

397
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,874
I got my license! I got my license!

398
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,043
Haley, car's not in park. Oh, oops.

399
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,312
You better run to that counter. Go.

400
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,814
Run! Run! Right now!

401
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,851
I still can't believe
you lost my truck.

402
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,486
It's gone, buddy. Let it go.

403
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,221
You know, maybe it's better

404
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,324
We don't solve this little mystery.

405
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:29,761
Sometimes treasure's more
sparkly in your imagination,

406
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:32,331
Where it could be
gold or baseball cards

407
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,665
Or pirate maps.

408
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,102
Do you really think there could
be pirate maps under there?

409
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,572
I'm 100% sure it's possible.

410
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,308
All right. I'm going in.

411
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:43,309
What?

412
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,548
Really? Buddy?

413
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,550
Whoa!

414
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:54,952
What do you see?

415
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,322
Nothing. It's really dark in here.

416
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,924
Wait a minute.
I think I see my truck.

417
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,227
It's right over there
by the -- uh-oh.

418
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,261
What?

419
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,563
I-I think I'm stuck.

420
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,797
How are you stuck?

421
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:09,167
My belt loop got caught
on a pipe, and it's hot!

422
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:10,903
Have you tried wiggling?

423
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,505
Dad! It's hot! Hurry!

424
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,939
I'm coming, buddy!

425
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:15,641
And hurry! There are
spiders in here!

426
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,845
Oh!

427
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,646
Coming!

428
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,016
And I'm sorry if we got
all weird in there.

429
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,350
Oh, it was fine.

430
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,186
Well, we'd like to say it's
different than how it usually is,

431
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,555
But you've seen us enough to
know that that's not true.

432
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,756
Guys, listen.

433
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,125
I had a very complicated
relationship with my mother.

434
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,728
She was born in japan
crazy-traditional.

435
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,196
She didn't want me
to become a doctor.

436
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,730
She wanted me to get
married and have kids.

437
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,766
But my father -- we would talk,

438
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,603
And he would actually
listen to what I wanted.

439
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,905
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

440
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,443
Having a mother isn't always
what it's cracked up to be.

441
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,580
And if you ask me,

442
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,583
Having two fathers who
care as much as you do

443
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,952
Makes lily the luckiest
little girl in the world.

444
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:03,321
Oh, thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you for that.

445
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,089
That's very sweet.
Thanks. Thank you.

446
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,658
And how are things with
you and your mom now?

447
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,092
ugh.

448
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:12,429
The only way she'll be happy is
if I'm some asian stereotype,

449
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,965
But that just isn't me.

450
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,671
I didn't see those!

451
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:27,877
I'm coming, buddy!

452
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:28,844
Over here.

453
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:32,215
That's a spider web. Oh, god.

454
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:33,916
My boy was in trouble,

455
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,620
So I put my fears aside,
and I came to his rescue.

456
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,089
Now, does that make me a hero?

457
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,590
Yes, it does.

458
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,393
Everything's gonna be okay.

459
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:46,963
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

460
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:48,765
there!

461
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,866
Thanks, dad.

462
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,602
Hey, just what dads do.
Let's get out of here.

463
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:53,837
I want my truck.

464
00:17:53,871 --> 00:17:55,305
Really?

465
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:57,273
It was a christmas gift!

466
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:58,908
Could you go get it?

467
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:03,346
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

468
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,547
Scoot. Scoot through.

469
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,286
There it is.

470
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,958
Got it.

471
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,392
You okay?

472
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,728
Yeah. Are you okay?

473
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:22,898
<i>You know what? I am okay.</i>

474
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:23,932
Hey! Hey.

475
00:18:23,966 --> 00:18:26,001
we did it! Whoo-hoo!

476
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,437
We're under the house! yeah!

477
00:18:29,906 --> 00:18:31,240
What the heck?

478
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:32,608
We're down here.

479
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,877
Why don't we see what we got,
huh? Yeah.

480
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:39,315
Two intrepid explorers...

481
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,884
Make their way on a journey --

482
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,954
Dead bodies!!

483
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:48,156
We called the police and got
a bunch of detectives over.

484
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:51,826
Turns out it was the last
owner's Halloween decorations,

485
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,327
Which is pretty funny.

486
00:18:53,362 --> 00:18:55,863
At least, I thought it was.

487
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:58,999
Everybody's afraid
of something, right?

488
00:18:59,034 --> 00:19:02,536
Heights, clowns, tight spaces.

489
00:19:02,571 --> 00:19:05,507
You like it, jay?!

490
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,510
I did it! Whoo!

491
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:10,278
Those are things you get over,

492
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:12,714
But then there's our children.

493
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:14,883
Will they fit in?

494
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:21,123
Will they be safe?

495
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:24,393
Those are fears you never get past.

496
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:30,166
So, sometimes, all you can
do is take a deep breath,

497
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,668
Pull them close,
and hope for the best.

498
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,404
Bye! Eyes on the road!

499
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,072
Love you!E!

500
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,007
Whoo-hoo! Oh, god!

501
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:41,910
I mean, things don't
always work out.

502
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:44,546
Oh, cam, I think she wants her doll

503
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,181
I don't know where it is.

504
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,250
<i>Mommy.</i>

505
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,621
<i>Mommy.</i>

506
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:54,490
<i>Mommy.</i>

507
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,892
When you squeeze the doll,
it says, "mommy."

508
00:19:56,927 --> 00:19:59,195
Did -- did you know that - no clue.

509
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,563
the doll says, "mommy."

510
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:04,099
The doll says, "mommy.
" the doll says, "mommy!"

511
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,003
But you got to love
it when they do.

512
00:20:11,153 --> 00:20:13,055
Mom says there's an old
trunk in the attic.

513
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:15,457
Oh, yeah, my grandpa's
old steamer trunk.

514
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:17,860
In this movie I saw,
there was this old trunk,

515
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:19,829
And there was a secret compartment,

516
00:20:19,863 --> 00:20:21,030
And when you opened it,

517
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:22,898
There was a whole
bunch of paintings

518
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,800
By the world's greatest painters

519
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:26,068
Hidden in the war.

520
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:28,137
My grandpa was in the war.

521
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,039
Should we go up there?

522
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:31,774
Totally. It could also be diamonds.

523
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:32,875
Or a samurai sword.

524
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,912
Or the declaration of independence.

525
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:38,981
You know, it almost doesn't
even matter what's up there.

526
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,384
What matters is what you do

527
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:43,252
With the money from
what's up there.

528
00:20:43,286 --> 00:20:45,020
We could get a motorboat.

529
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:46,955
Or a robotic gutter cleaner.

530
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,290
Or an indoor pool.

531
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:48,724
Or a two-man submarine.

532
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,725
