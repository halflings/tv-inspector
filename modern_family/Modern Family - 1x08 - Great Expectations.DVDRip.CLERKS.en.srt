Oh, my God.

151
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,766
That was so easy.
This is awesome.

happened there, do you?

P.j.'s on, Haley!
What?

154
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:22,358
Um, I would be happy
to let her change in my room.

155
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,115
[Doorbell Rings]
Hmm.

156
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,827
Who could that be?
Are you expecting
someone special?

157
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,455
What did you do?

158
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,042
Nothing. I just know
that there's someone
at the door.

159
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:50,136
- Rock on, Phil Dunphy.
- Bam! Read it and weep, Phil.

160
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,180
Oh.
It's the Iz.

161
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,101
- [Phil] Who?
- Izzy LaFontaine
from Spandau Ballet.

162
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:00,855
Dizzy Dontaine
from Spa- Hey.
He's got it now.

163
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,483
He's got it. He's just
seriously freaking out.
Yes!

164
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,152
Phil loves Spandau Ballet.

165
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,364
That song "True"
was playing in the car
the first time we kissed.

166
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,991
It's our song.
So I did some research,

167
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,662
found out that the lead guitarist
lives, like, 40 miles from here.

168
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,247
He was in the phone book.
How '80s is that?

169
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,917
I never liked
Spandau Ballet.

170
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,252
Our entire marriage,
I never once
mentioned Spandau Ballet.

Am I even
pronouncing that right?

172

a private concert for us
is the guitarist-

173
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,178
Bass player, actually.
And lead singer-

174
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,472
Well, backup, backup.
Of Spandau Ballet.

175
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:38,017

and Martin Kemp.

The old one or the young one?
