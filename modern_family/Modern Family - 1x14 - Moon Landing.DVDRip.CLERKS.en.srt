If we collect enough bottles,
they build a school in Africa.

Wouldn't that be so cool to go
to a school made out of bottles?

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,141
That would certainly be
a special school.

"Special school"?

Luke, let me tell you something.

It's just now she works for us.

I will have you know that I had
quite the little career going.

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,980
I was an account manager
at Starcrest Hotels.

25
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:07,234
I had a little cubicle, and-and
I wore my tennis shoes to work...

Mm-hmm.

I don't mind saying
I was making quite a splash.

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,953
- Well, then, why'd you quit?
- Well, Haley, call me old-fashioned,

31
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,913
but I wanted to focus
on raising a family.

32
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,040
So I married your dad.

33
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,626
Five months later,
we... were...

34

There's my lawyer.

Gloria got into
a little car accident,

38
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:38,139
so my dad asked me
to help her out.

39
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:41,935
And, uh, this is the first time
that my dad's asked me
for legal advice,

40
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,937
and it's- it's nice.

that he respects me in that way.

Oh.

My dream for him
is that one day he'll be
on the Supreme Court.

Why, Cam?

So at parties I can
tell everyone my partner

00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:57,458
Wait. You're
on the 23rd floor?
I'm on the 24th floor.

150
00:06:57,585 --> 00:07:00,461
Wow. That's insane.
It's- It's no big deal.

151
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,132
I mean, if you hadn't left,
it probably would have been you.

152
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:12,473
[Gloria]
I was driving along this street.
The cars were parked just like this.

153
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,393
And boom-
Out of nowhere, he hits me.

154
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay, so,
he-he cut you off?
Yes.

155
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,522
Right.
A crazy driver.

156
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,608
You know, I used to be
a little bit like that.

157
00:07:21,692 --> 00:07:24,861
I don't know, maybe it's because
of Lily, but I've definitely
become more considerate.

158
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,531
Like, I used to never
let people in, and now I do.

159
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,035
Just now getting
that metaphor. Okay.

160
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:34,203
So, what do you think?
Were there any witnesses?

161
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,414
No, just Manny.
He was in the back seat.

162
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,292
Okay.
It all happened so fast-
Just like they say.

163
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,294
Yeah. All right.
Well, this is what we're gonna do.

164
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,005
I'll take a few pictures,
and then we'll sit down
and write a statement.

165
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,923
Perfect.
I'll go and get us a table.

166
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,884
All right.
Manny, come.

167
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,678
Uh, just a minute, Mom.
I need to tie my shoe.
Okay.

168
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,513
- Mitchell.
- Yeah?

169
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,849
Don't talk. Listen.
It was her fault.

170
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,394
- I'm sorry. What?
- Don't look at me. Do something.
Take pictures.

171
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,148
Manny! What kind
of cupcake do you want?

172
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:05,026
Um, that's okay.
I'm not hungry.

173
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,904
That was a mistake.
Now she'II know
something's up.

174
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,032
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

175
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,284
She cut that guy off.
She's a terrible driver.

176
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,204
She's a danger to us all.
Okay, wait. Now stop.

177
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,040
I thought she said he was parked
and then he cut her off.

178
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,459
Everybody looks parked
when you're going
a hundred miles an hour.

179
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,878
Manny,
why didn't you speak up?

180
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,339
She can't take criticism
about her driving.

181
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,424
Once an old lady yelled
at her at a crosswalk.

182
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,426
She honked so long,
the horn ran out.

183
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,346
Manny!

184
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,139
I've said too much already.

185
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,142
[Sighs]

186
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:40,144
Are you hearing this?

187
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,733
Aw, that's-
Point.

188
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,277
Hinder!

189
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:49,862
[Jay]
Oh!

190
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,906
Boom.
Lucky shot!

191
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,659
That is game and,
I believe, match.

192
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,912
Yeah, fine, you won.
But, you know, what do you expect?

193
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,249
For the first half of the game,
I was distracted by what
happened in the locker room.

194
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,252
And you're sure it's not
because I'm a fabulous
racquetball player?

195
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,921
You're average.
But I was a little thrown
by you touching me.

196
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,215
Which is unnatural-
Not to you, of course.

197
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,384
- No, to you it's like rocket fuel.
- Oh, sure.

198
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,345
When you're gay
you just walk around giving
butt bumps to everybody.

199
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,347
It's like a high five.
It's a low two.

200
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,726
You know what?
I'm gonna prove that you won
only because I was distracted.

201
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,103
We're gonna have a rematch
right here, right now.

202
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,147
So you want to go
up against me again?
Yes.

203
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,982
No! Damn it.

204
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,984
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- [Jay] Hello!

205
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,903
Hey, Dad. Uh, did you know that
the accident was Gloria's fault?

206
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,573
Yes. I mean, I wasn't there,
but she's a horrible driver.

207
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:35,283
If she hit 10 cars,
I wouldn't be surprised.

208
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,410
If you knew it was her fault,
why did you get me involved?

209
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,455
Because someone has to tell her
she's in the wrong,
and better you than me.

210
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,708
That's great. Here I am thinking
that my dad actually respects me
as a lawyer,

211
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,710
and really you're just
throwing me to the wolves.

212
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,921
- Can't it be both?
- Okay. Dad, it doesn't
bother you in the least...

213
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,841
that your gay son
is the only one tough enough
to stand up to your wife?

214
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,801
Go get 'em, Rocky.
See you later.

215
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,180
Your father and I had a
moon landing in the locker room.
What's the matter with you?

216
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:01,017
What about you?
Do you ever get serious
with anyone? Thank you.

217
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,894
Sure.
Oh, no. Not yet.

218
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh, honey, you will.

219
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,899
Oh, no, I hope not.
It's- It's fun.

220
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:09,859
I'm sorry. I'm just-
I'm waiting for some news.

221
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:13,279
What news?
I'm- I'm up for the Paris job.

222
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,948
The-The head of
the international division?

223
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,950
That's- That's-
That's crazy.

224
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,161
Yeah, no. I mean,
I'll never get it, but it'd be great...

225
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,163
'cause one of my lovers
lives in Paris.

226
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,917
Wow. I-I don't know
what jumps out
of that sentence more-

227
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,960
you know,
"lovers" or "one of."

228
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,797
Well, I'm single.
I mean, it's kinda what you do.

229
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,174
Uh-huh.
I have one in Paris.

230
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh.
Um, I have Paris,
New York, Miami.

231
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,055
I have a fourth one.

232
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:41,974
I'm forgetting one lover.
I'm forgetting one lover.
Mmm.

233
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,894
Last night I vacuumed
the radiator thingy
under the fridge.

234
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,648
You know, it collects the dust.
'Cause you should, and I don't. So-

235
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,734
[Cell Phone Rings]
Oh, hey, hold on.
Cross your fingers.

236
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,820
I'm not gonna lie.

237
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,989
The thought of Valerie getting
the one job in the whole company
that everyone coveted-

238
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,283
Well, I wasn't a "lover" of that.

239
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,452
Okay. Okay, thank you.

240
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,580
[Beeps]
Well?

241
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,582
Oh, they haven't
made a decision.

242
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,043
They're- They're gonna
tell me later on.

243
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,754
That's not what
they said, is it?
Uh, yeah, it is.

244
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, Valerie, come on.
It's me.

245
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:17,009
What are friends for,
if not to be there for you
when you get bad news?

246
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,679
I got it.
Oh, my God.
Aaah!

247
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm the head of Europe.
Well, you know,
for the hotel-

248
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,477
Not the continent.
Kind of though. Kind of.

249
00:11:26,562 --> 00:11:29,105
Why didn't you tell me
when you first heard?

250
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,859
Oh, 'cause, you know-

251
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,278
And that's when
it really hit me.

252
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,030
Valerie wasn't jealous of me.
She pitied me.

253
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,117
And part of me wanted
to take her back to the house...

254
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,369
and show her everything
she was missing...

255
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,789
in her sad, childless,
husbandless life.

256
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:51,627
But there's a little thing
called "taking the high road."

257
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:55,047
Why don't you come by
and meet everybody?
Oh, sure. That'd be great.

258
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,216
Yeah, I mean,
Alex is just a genius,

259
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,261
and Haley is turning into
this beautiful young woman,

260
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,222
and it makes me realize
that motherhood is-
San Francisco.

261
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,725
The most important-
That was my fourth lover.
San Francisco.

262
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,977
It would have kept me up all night.
Yeah.

263
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,689
Dad, look.

264
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,900
Just a sec, buddy.
I'm on my way out to the bathroom.

265
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:16,068
Check it out. The Aubreys
had this huge party last night,

266
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,820
and we got all these bottles
to recycle.

267
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:20,406
Great.
What's Jägermeister?

268
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,117
Um-

269
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,328
Well, you know how
in a fairy tale...

270
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,622
there's always a potion
that makes the princess
fall asleep,

271
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,540
and then the guys
start kissing her?

272
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:32,668
Well, this is like that,
except you don't wake up
in a castle,

273
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,671
you wake up in a frat house
with a bad reputation.

Hang on. I'm coming.

I thought I I.M.'ed you
to stay away.

Ow! Haley.

285
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,726
Hello? Dylan?
D-Money?

Hey, buddy! Hey, buddy!

Hello, friendly neighbors!

288

Little help?

289
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,611
- But I love you.
- Well, you should have
thought about that...

290
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,323
before you took that
skank Sharon Nicolini
to an Anne Hathaway movie.

291
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:45,950
I didn't take her.
She was just there.

292
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,745
So you were just there by yourself
at an Anne Hathaway movie?

293
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,666
I don't think so!
Yeah. Yeah.
I like her movies.

294
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,627
She's every woman.
Come on. Let's not fight.

295
00:13:56,712 --> 00:14:01,382
- Let's just discuss this
like two un-immature adults.
- Oh!

296
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,176
[Clears Throat]
[Ringing]

297
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:06,053
Oh. Oh.
[Beeps]

298
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,638
Hello?
Mrs. Patterson.

299
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:09,724
Hi. I've been waiting
for your call.

300
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,935
Yeah. Uh, is there any chance
that maybe we could talk a little bit-

301
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,479
No, no, no, no. Now's perfect.
That's fine.

302
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:19,066
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Let me just close my office door.

303
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,569
There we go.
Much, much better.

304
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,658
Okay. Maybe, uh,
we should go over
the accident one more time.

305
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:31,287
Put the dogs on a row.
You're such a good lawyer.

306
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,874
Uh, I just wanna make sure
we're 100% clear on
exactly what happened.

307
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,126
Oh, we're clear.
I told you.

308
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,671
What?
You don't believe me?

309
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:42,673
No, no. I just-

310
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,884
You know, sometimes
you can forget tiny details.

311
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,013
Like, is it possible,
maybe, uh, you were
driving too fast?

312
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,515
Who said I was driving fast?
Yeah, who?

313
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,393
I just-
I'm looking at the street,

314
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:56,729
and I'm thinking if you were
driving a little fast,

315
00:14:56,855 --> 00:15:00,941
- it's possible that maybe
you didn't see the car-
- You're like everyone else, huh?

316
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:05,071
You blame the Latino driver.
Where I come from, they always
blame the Latino driver.

317
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,406
Where you come from,
isn't everybody a Latino driver?

318
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,910
Manny, tell him.
I can't 'cause I have
a cupcake in my mouth.

319
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,079
Oh, come on.
Don't blame your cupcake.

320
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,122
What?
You think I'm guilty too?

321
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,124
No.
Fine.

322
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,668
I don't need you
as a lawyer anymore.

323
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,421
And if you two
think I'm such a bad driver,

324
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,423
you're safer walking home.

325
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:28,135
- Chao.
- [Mouths Word]

326
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,930
Here it is.
It's really cute.

327
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,015
Yeah.
We're pretty proud of it.

328
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,267
Here's your stupid CDs...

329
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,561
and your clothes
and your poems!

330
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,147
Don't you do it!
Oh, I'm doing it.

331
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:43,692
- Haley, stop it.
What are you doing?
- Tearing out my heart.

332
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,862
Oh, why don't you
go get a hickey
from Sharon Nicolini?

333
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,448
It's from my guitar strap,
Haley.

334
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,284
Oh, thanks
for reminding me.
That's my daughter Haley-

335
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,828
[Objects Crash]
[Dylan Groans]

336
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,747
And her boyfriend, Dylan, um-

337
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,833
This is a nice color.
Yeah.

338
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:01,001
Um, listen.
This is not normal,

339
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,796
with all that, nor-
nor is that liquor smell.

340
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,299
Phil, honey? Oh, my God.
Luke, what is that?

341
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,511
Jägermeister.
Dad says it makes girls
easier to kiss.

342
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:13,013
- What happened to the rug?
- I had an accident.

343
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:16,267
- Okay. Alex, what are you doing?
- I'm trying to kill a rat.

344
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,310
Okay-

345
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,479
[Dylan]
Sharon was helping me
buy you a birthday present.

346
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,565
Don't you get it?
I love your ass.

347
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,068
I- You know, I-
I-I'm late and I should go.

348
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,820
I know. I know.
Yeah.

349
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,489
And it seems like things
have gotten a little wonky
around here.

350
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,075
I don't know where Phil is.
He's definitely-

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,077
[Both Scream]

352
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,079
Oh, my God. Alex-

353
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,291
Where's your father?
He went outside
to go to the bathroom.

354
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,334
Uh-huh.
Ooh!

355
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,588
It's... not usually like this.
Oh, gross.

356
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,842
Let's just get married.
Okay.

357
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,887
[Phil]
You will not regret this
decision, Mrs. Patterson.

358
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,931
And I'll tell you what.
We're gonna have you over to
our little house to celebrate.

359
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,725
Okay? Okay, bye-bye.
You should come back again-

360
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,936
sometime,
when you get a break-
Claire! Claire!

361
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,397
- Hey.
- Phil, what are you-
What are you doing?

362
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:07,109
Just concluding a little business.
Very successfully, I might add.

363
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,777
Honey-
Hey!

364
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,070
- Hi.
- Is that Valerie?

365
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:11,989
- [Valerie] Yeah.
- Wow!

366
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:13,657
You look fantastic.
Thank you.

367
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,868
Come here.
Get over here.

368
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,912
Okay.

369
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,955
How long has it been?
A long time.

370
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,957
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, I can't touch you. Okay.

371
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,585
A little bit difficult.
Gulf divides us, eh?

372
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,587
So nice to see you.
It's great
to see you though-

373
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:27,838
Okay.
All right.

374
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,673
Okay, then.
Thanks for coming by.

375
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,091
It's such a pleasure.
Bye-bye.

376
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,927
Thanks for stopping by.
You have a beautiful family.

377
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,180
She looks great,
doesn't she?
What is on your face?

378
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:43,687
One time! Once!

379
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,731
One time I bring
somebody home...

380
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,108
who I want to impress,
and what do I find?

381
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:51,070
A bunch of booze-drenched
hill people...

382
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:53,781
just sitting around in their underwear
and-and chasing rats...

383
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,950
and fornicating in the stairwell.

384
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:59,036
Can I say something?
No. No, you can't,
Mario.

385
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,622
There is nothing left
to say but thank you.

386
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,666
Thank you all.

387
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,802
Ow!

388
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,595
I told you I'd win.
[Shower Running]

389
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,764
Not talking so much now,
are you, hotshot?

390
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,684
[Water Off]
Hope you enjoy
that nice, hot shower,

391
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:26,313
but it's not gonna
wash away the shame
of that 15-7 beatdown.

392
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,358
You should have seen
the look on your face...

393
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,360
when that drop shot
just kissed the wall.

394
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,696
[Chuckling]
Ah. Okay, splashdown.

395
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,240
Got me again. Yep.

396
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,325
Make the uptight straight guy
all embarrassed.

397
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,619
Except for one thing-
Doesn't even bother me anymore.

398
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:43,789
I could do this all day.
Here, another one for you.

399
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,000
Maybe a couple of 'em.
[Chuckles]

400
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,626
Jay, I just noticed
a sauna back here.

401
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,462
How big of a hurry
are we in?
Biggest hurry of your life.

402
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:54,091
'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.

403
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,093
Well, if you're
going to be stranded,

404
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,137
might as well be
in a place full of cupcakes.

405
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,055
I don't think
you need any more.

406
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,934
Ay. I'm sorry, guys.

407
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,354
It's true-
I am a defensive driver.

408
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,649
You mean you're
defensive about-
I know what I am.

409
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,651
Let's go.

410
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:17,823
It's just that I don't like
when people just assume
that I'm a bad driver.

411
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,409
Maybe it was just, like,
a little bit my fault.

412
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,453
Well, I'm glad
you can admit that, Gloria.

413
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,748
But I'm still gonna
need you as my lawyer, Mitch.

414
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,249
Why?
Because this one-

415
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:31,086
It was not my fault,
I promise you.

416
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:36,091
That's what
that sound was.
It was the big cupcake.

417
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:39,136
That was unreal.
Mom was crazy.

418
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,138
I'm scared.

419
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:45,059
Look. I know your mom
pretty well. She's fine.

420
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,936
I'd be willing to bet
she's just composing herself,

421
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:50,105
taking a nice, long,
peaceful walk in the park.

422
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,782
[Squirts]

423
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,743
[Muffled]
Perfect.

424
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,622
[Claire]
At that moment all I wanted
was to be with my family.

425
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,208
But of course, that meant
finding a way to apologize...

426
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,294
to the people that
I had belittled and rejected.

427
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,381
- [Groans]
- Okay, you are so crazy.
That song totally rules.

428
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,841
[Alex]
Daddy, you're crazy.
Crazy right.

429
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,218
Hey, honey.
Hi.

430
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:20,761
[Luke] Hey, Mom.
Come on. Sit down.

431
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,056
No, seriously, Dad.
It's lame.
Seriously, Luke. It's not.

432
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,100
You got some mustard
or something on your face.

433
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:28,894
I think I know
a little bit about music.
I was a deejay in college.

434
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,480
I had my own show-
in the coveted time slot.

435
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,024
Daybreak with Dunphy.
[Haley]
Are you kidding me?

436
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,693
No, I'm not kidding you.
And I played Rick Astley.

437
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,446
Dad, that's embarrassing.
Never gonna give-
Sing it, Luke.

438
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,448
[Claire]
They could have been petty.

439
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,493
They really could have
made me pay, but they didn't.

440
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,495
Never loved 'em more.

441
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,832
Why the hell couldn't Valerie
