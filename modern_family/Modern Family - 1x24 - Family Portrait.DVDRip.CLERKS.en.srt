How do- How do you
turn the sprinklers off?

299
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,671
¡Ay! Of course!
Because I'm Latina,

300
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,215
I'm supposed to know everything
about gardening and sprinklers!

301
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,551
You were here
when they installed it.

302
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,804
Ay, yeah.
The box is across the yard.

303
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:15,057
You mean
your now-soaking-wet yard?
That's great. We are screwed.

304
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:19,478
No, we're not.
We haven't unwrapped
our secret weapon yet.

305
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,940
Luke walks over there,
Hurt Locker style...

306
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:28,737
flips the switch, and boom-
or not boom- water off.

307
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:32,324
Put the "he" in "hero," Son.

308
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,831
Oh.

309
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,208
Hurt Locker?
It's more like Squirt Locker.

310
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,964
Really? That wasn't funny?
I actually pity you guys.

311
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,757
[Clicking]

312
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,760
[Cheering]

313
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,013
No time to celebrate!
Stop it!

314
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,765
We don't have a lot of time.
[Photographer]
All right, everybody.

315
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,101
If I can have the little
ones down front-
You know what, sir?

316
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,812
If you don't mind, I've got this.
Come on, people, let's get out here.

317
00:17:01,897 --> 00:17:04,064
Haley, Alex, I need you
to unwrap your brother.

318
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:06,650
All right, I need the Dunphys
over on this side.

319
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:12,573
Dad, you're in the middle.
Mitchell, Cam, Lily on this end. Okay.

320
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,158
Listen.
Uh-huh?

321
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:18,245
Honey, I screwed up,
but if ever you're
in my arms again-

322
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,706
Phil, not now.
Yes, now. I don't want
to look at this picture...

323
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,374
when I'm 80 years old
and you're long dead...

324
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,627
and know that you were angry
at me when we took it.

325
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,212
Phil, we'll talk about
what you did later.

326
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,005
Okay, everybody.
Eyes over here.

327
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:32,218
I didn't do anything.
She kissed me.
What?

328
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,178
Who kissed you?
Gloria.

329
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,639
What?
It was the kiss cam.

330
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,808
Why did you kiss Cam?
No, I kissed Phil.
He told me I had to.

331
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,810
No, no.
Okay, hang on a second.

332
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,521
Was this before or after
you ignored the phone call
from your wife?

333
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,607
You saw that too?
Mmm.

334
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,902
Could we please just take
the damn picture?

335
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,238
Okay. Everybody,
one more time.

336
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:55,115
Just so you know,
I am angry with you.
I knew it!

337
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,409
- Oh, damn it!
- It was a big day for me,

338
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,703
and he didn't want to go
because he doesn't like
small talk.

339
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,705
Would it be terribly inconvenient...

340
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,874
to just postpone this hissy fit
for a few minutes?

341
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,919
- Maybe some of us don't
want to take a picture today.
- Thank you.

342
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:09,630
And please, Claire, don't try
to make Mitchell do something
he doesn't wanna do.

343
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,924
Oh, shut up, Cam.
[Lmitating Wings Flapping]

344
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,134
Okay, stop it! Stop it!

345
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,887
Everyone, listen.
This took me forever
to put together,

346
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:21,600
so I don't really care
who kissed who and who's got
a pimple on her head...

347
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,644
and who is wearing an outrageously
inappropriate dress.

348
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:27,606
We are gonna get together
and act like a normal family...

349
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:30,985
for one-tenth of a freaking second,
and we're gonna do it right now.

350
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,071
Get your hands off of me.
No. No. Make me. Make me.

351
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:37,783
Ah, this is ridiculous.
You're both uptight about everything.

352
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:42,121
You didn't want to go to
a wedding with him because you
didn't want to make small talk?

353
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,915
That's how I met Gloria.
Do you remember the first thing
I said to you?

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,170
Yes. "I like chocolate,
I like fruit, but not together."

355
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:52,548
You couldn't come up
with that, lvy League? And you.

356
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,302
You would be a lot happier
if you weren't so obsessed
with everything being perfect.

357
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:59,388
Look at us here all in white.
What are we, a cricket team?

358
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,850
News flash.
Life is not perfect, Claire.

359
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,893
Now calm the hell down.

360
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,855
Okay, Dad, that's great,
and that's really easy
for you to say.

361
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:11,775
But do you think
I like being like this?
No, I don't.

362
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:15,237
If you have some quick-and-easy fix,
why don't you just give it to me
right now?

363
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,201
Oh.
[All Groaning]

364

Oh, my God.

365
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,290
I- I got this, baby.

366
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:31,420
No. What did-
What did you do?
Now two people are dirty.

367
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,716
Well, three.
Okay, you know what?

368
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,594
That's for "kitschy."
Mud fight!

369
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:43,432
[Claire]
No. Don't do that.
No, no, no! Stop it!

370
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,061
Everybody get back in line.
Come on, guys, stop.

371
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:51,565
- [Chattering, Laughing]
- [Claire] Damn it. Damn it! Guys!

372
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,736
Excuse me.
Are we still doing this?

373
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,072
No. No, we're not.

374
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,787
[All Laughing]

375

- Now we are.
- [Gloria] We're ready!

00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,960
[Laughing]
Whoo-hoo!

377
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:15,464
- Say "cheese."
- Say "cheese"!

378
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,343
[Jay] Back in '68,
when I was sweeping up hair
in that barbershop,

379
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,679
I had this mental picture
of the family that,
if I was lucky enough,

380
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:26,725
one day I would end up with-
perfect wife, perfect kids.

381
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,061
Guess what.
I didn't get any of that.

382
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,438
Wound up with this sorry bunch.

383
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,858
And I'm thankful for that
every day.

384
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,027
Well, most days.

385
00:20:37,112 --> 00:20:39,071
I think I'm just gonna go
with the Elvis stuff.

386
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,615
Yeah. I would.

387
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:47,371
Uh, to the right.
To the right.

388
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,248
A skosh to the left.

389
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,000
There we go.
[Inhales]

390
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:55,754
Whatever. I'm gonna have to take
the picture down when I repaint
the wall anyhow.

391
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,590
Kill me now.
What?

♪ Don't know how
I got so lucky ♪

393
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,721
Mm-hmm.

- I love that picture.
- Yeah.

395
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:13,313
- Is that a chip on
the frame right there?
- No. No.
