No, he was supposed to

00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:31,289
Hey, did javier call you?

488
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,624
No, why?

489
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,725
He's dragging me to this bar

490
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,993
With some of his old baseball pals.

491
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,661
He was supposed to be here at 5:00.

492
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:37,729
Ah, he's dragging you, huh?

493
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,097
Yeah, I figured it would be okay.

494
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,499
I mean, I've seen half these guys play,

495
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,169
And javier says it's cool.

496
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,004
What? What's the joke?

497
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,106
Nothing.

498
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,475
It's just funny to me
that you make fun of me

499
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,011
Beuse I was seduced by him,
and here you are --

500
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,313
No one is getting seduced.

501
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,416
I'm doing this for manny.

502
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,384
Oh, yeah, it's very important for manny

503
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:01,021
That you two go and have a
nice picnic in the mountains.

504
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:02,256
First of all, it wasn't a picnic.

505
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,390
We stopped for coffee.

506
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:06,026
They just happened to be selling crepes.

507
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:08,628
Just let me know when he calls, all right?

508
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:10,797
Geez, it's almost 6:00.

509
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,498
[ muffled laugh ]

510
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,501
Claire: The kids are so
excited for you to come home.

511
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,501
Oh, me too.

512
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,003
Yeah, luke made you a sign.

513
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,137
Oh, he's a sweetie.

514
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,405
Yeah.

515
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,873
You seem great.

516
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:23,874
I am great.

517
00:17:23,908 --> 00:17:25,042
Good.

518
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,777
Except for that firemen thing.

519
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,078
You remember it. Mm-hmm.

520
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,515
Yeah, okay. Look, I am sorry.

521
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,749
I'm so sorry. Ah, no.

522
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,852
Sorry. There's no excuse for it.

523
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,723
I-I think I just spend so much
time in dowdy mom clothes,

524
00:17:37,758 --> 00:17:40,560
And I'm covered in paste and peanut butter,

525
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:42,095
And I just --

526
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,900
I wanted to feel attractive
for a second, you know?

527
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:47,635
I'm sorry. I really --

528
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:51,138
Honey, I just
-- just need a little bit of time.

529
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:52,907
Gonna be fine.

530
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,108
Okay. Yeah.

531
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:55,676
Okay.

532
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,944
I was already fine with it.

533
00:17:56,979 --> 00:17:58,747
Here's the deal -- claire messed up.

534
00:17:58,781 --> 00:18:03,017
She owed me. This never happens.

535
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:05,253
Old phil has a golden ticket.

536
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:08,222
Now, I could have cashed that in
right away for something small --

537
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,691
Get out of cleaning the garage,
a week at circus camp.

538
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,960
Oh, still fresh. Yeah.

539
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:15,863
But the longer you hold onto it,

540
00:18:15,897 --> 00:18:19,967
The more the guilt builds, the more you get.

541
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:23,504
Five years -- trip to paris with my buddies.

542
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:27,641
10 years -- sweet, little convertible.

543
00:18:27,676 --> 00:18:29,209
20 years --

544
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:33,714
Hello, fully articulating,
five-function robot

545
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,316
That can read my mind

546
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:38,185
And has feelings.

547
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:40,187
Phil, you're not leaving

548
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:41,956
Without saying goodbye, are you?

549
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,057
Hey, elaine.

550
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,025
Is this your husband? Uh-huh.

551
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,527
Goodbye, paris.

552
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,162
I'm visiting my sister,

553
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,864
And he was entertaining us all
afternoon with his card tricks.

554
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:50,865
Oh.

555
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:52,266
Is that phil? Hey.

556
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:54,603
[ laughs nervously ]

557
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,474
Hey, mom, phil's leaving.

558
00:18:58,508 --> 00:19:00,276
Without a hug?

559
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,144
Wow.

560
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:05,715
Goodbye, fully articulating,
five-function robot

561
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,151
With the ability to -- goodbye.

562
00:19:08,185 --> 00:19:09,819
Brittany, hurry, honey. Phil's leaving.

563
00:19:09,853 --> 00:19:10,920
Ow.

564
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,521
You're fine.

565
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,759
How's your ankle?

566
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:18,260
It's cold.

567
00:19:18,294 --> 00:19:19,928
I'm sorry I hurt you.

568
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:21,095
No, no, don't be.

569
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,664
I'm --

570
00:19:22,698 --> 00:19:25,100
I could have just as easily hurt you.

571
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,235
Well, it's cute that you think that.

572
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:31,906
Listen, cam, I-I can't
always be the bad cop here.

573
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:33,341
I know it's my issue,

574
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,745
But she can't grow up with one huggy,
happy, cuddly dad

575
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:40,682
And one frowny, lesson-teachy dad.

576
00:19:40,716 --> 00:19:42,817
Because guess which one

577
00:19:42,852 --> 00:19:44,852
She's gonna ask to walk her down the aisle.

578
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,389
[ sighs ]

579
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:48,990
O-- y--

580
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:50,358
Okay, you know what?

581
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:52,593
I can be the bad cop sometimes.

582
00:19:52,628 --> 00:19:55,630
I'll always make her eat her vegetables.

583
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:57,598
Okay. Dentist.

584
00:19:57,632 --> 00:19:58,666
Deal. Good.

585
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,034
As long as you make her practice her violin.

586
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,636
Oh, yeah, the violin. I like that.

587
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:05,438
And we're both walking her down the aisle.

588
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,106
[ winces ]

589
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,741
Assuming you can walk by then.

590
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,943
Ow! Do you need to go to
the hospital for that?

591
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:13,947
No, god, no. No, it's not that bad.

592
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,283
You meant call 911, didn't you?

593
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,417
Firemen.

594
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:20,353
Yeah, you call and I'm
gonna go change my shirt.

595
00:20:20,388 --> 00:20:24,224
So, if I'm supposed to act like an adult,

596
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:27,327
Is that act like adults
I see in the world...

597
00:20:27,361 --> 00:20:29,195
Water weasel!

598
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,397
...Or the adults in my family?

599
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:38,338
'cause if it's the ones in my family...

600
00:20:38,372 --> 00:20:39,505
Come on. Let's go.

601
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,640
All right.

602
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,242
Then...

603
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,678
How hard could that be?

604
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,947
Aah!

605
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:52,810
Really got me fired up about my magic again.

606
00:20:53,344 --> 00:20:54,377
[ blows ]

607
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,813
Is...This your card?

608
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,782
Yes. Oh, my gosh!

609
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,218
It's -- it's not, is it?

610
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,520
No, uh -- no, it's -- 's not.

611
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,723
The hardest part is when
people forget their card

612
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:07,425
Because then I look like the idiot.

613
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,759
All right, let's do it again.

614
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:10,494
We really have to go. You think I like this?

615
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:13,363
I'm sorry. Here. I'm gonna
teach you one, okay? Oh, my --

616
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,998
On the count of three, just grab this.

617
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,533
You ready? Put your hand out. Okay.

618
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:18,601
1, 2, 3.

619
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,602
There it is.

620
00:21:19,636 --> 00:21:21,637
No. What was that? Wow.

621
