Can't call me that anymore.

150
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,781
Just got canned.

151
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,366
Oh- Really?

152
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,535
Guess a couple people
complained I wasn't fat enough.

153
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:54,372
Well, that's terrible.
That's what I get for trying not
to have a second heart attack.

154
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,041
There you go.
Always a way to make room.

155
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:00,086
Take it from someone
who lives in his car.
Um-

156
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, well,
thank you so much.

157
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:04,048
No problem.
Merry Christmas.

158
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,302
Um, wait, wait. Um, please,
uh, let me give you
a little something...

159
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,928
for your troubles.
No, that's okay.
No, no, really-

160
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,888
Gosh. Really? Okay.
Do you really
live in your car?

161
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,393
Yeah. It's not so bad.
It's pretty roomy
since the wife moved out.

162
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,521
[Mouthing Words]
Why don't you come over to our
place for dinner tonight?

163
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:21,232
- Seriously?
- Yeah. It's Christmas Eve.

164
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,443
Y-You can't spend it
in your car.

165
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,445
Wow, that's really
nice of you guys.

166
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,740
Listen, can I bring anything?
Ketchup, soy sauce, straws?

167
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,742
We're good.

168
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,119
So, uh, why don't you
follow us to our house?

169
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,704
Okay.
In your house.

170
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,914
[Chuckles]
[Chuckles]

171
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,166
[Man]
All right!

172
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,709
Cameron.
What?

173
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:47,592
Okay. Tonight, 9:00 sharp,
we open one present each.

174
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,260
Pajamas- which we sleep in.

175
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:52,180
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m.,
Manny,

176
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:54,766
on the stairs
for the Christmas picture.

177
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,226
Then we open presents.

178
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,563
In Colombia, they open presents
at midnight and stay up till morning.

179
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,983
I'm sure that they do, but as
you'll notice from the absence
of goats in the street,

180
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:05,568
we are not in Colombia.

181
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,404
Come on! I'm kidding.

182
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,407
Why can't we mix a couple
of Colombian traditions in?

183
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,951
- Like what?
- Like fireworks.

184
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,953
Come on. You don't have
fireworks in Colombia.

185
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,705
You're trying to make me
the inocente again.

186
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,125
No, we do. At night
the sky is beautiful-
very Christmassy.

187
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,921
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Look, every country
has their own traditions.

188
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,882
In our culture, for example,
the baby Jesus is the one...

189
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,343
that brings the gifts,
not the Santa Claus.

190
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,847
But that doesn't make sense.
How could a newborn baby
carry all those presents?

191
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:36,599
They don't even know
where their hands are.

192
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,476
At least a baby can
fit through a chimney.

193
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,146
How would you sit
on the baby Jesus' lap?
You'd squish it.

194
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,025
Manny, next year we'll talk
about some of your little
Colombian traditions.

195
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,112
- Okay? Maybe.
- I know what "maybe" means.

196
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,614
It's like you're trying to
take away my whole Christmas.

197
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,244
I can't believe it's all gone.
Dad never follows through.

198
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,871
Are you sure one of your friends
didn't burn the couch?

199
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:03,084
Hey, don't look at me.
Only one of us was ever
caught playing with matches.

200
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,213
Luke?
That was a year ago.
Just admit you did it.

201
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,923
- You admit you did it!
- No!

202
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,175
Okay. Look,
I have an idea.

203
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,177
Do you remember the movie
Spartacus?

204
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,809
Here's what we do:
Luke, you tell Mom and Dad
it's your fault.

205
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,978
- I didn't do it.
- It doesn't matter.

206
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,941
Because after you confess,
Haley and I will each
confess to the same thing.

207
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,943
How does that do anything?

208
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,404
They'll be so touched that
we're protecting each other...

209
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,865
that they'll have to
bring back Christmas.

210
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,867
That's awesome.

211
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,453
How does it work again?

212
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,580
We're gonna pass
into legend.

213
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,874
- The parents who canceled Christmas.
- I thought you'd be happy.

214
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,792
They'II write songs
about us,

215
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,336
make one of those Christmas
specials with those ugly
little clay people.

216
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,882
You're the one who always says
I shouldn't be such a pushover
with the kids.

217
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,427
- So this is where you decide to
make your stand? Really, Phil?
- Okay. Okay, look.

218
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,429
Don't worry.
We're going to have Christmas.

219
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,265
We've raised our kids right.
Whoever did it will come forward.

220
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,893
Or the other two
will rat 'em out.

221
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:03,436
Mom, Dad.

222
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,899
Hey, Luke. What, uh-
What can we do for you?

223
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,110
[Sighs]

224
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,779
I did it.

225
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,323
I was playing with matches.
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,785
You, uh- You did
the right thing-
Yeah.

227
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,788
By confessing, but, um-

228
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,291
This is bad, buddy.
I mean, really bad, okay?

229
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,127
Claire, you want
to handle this?

230
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:31,214
Um, Luke, why didn't you
say something?

231
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,049
Mmm, I don't know.

232
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,178
Okay, well, your father
and I are extremely
disappointed in you, so-

233
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,931
Go up to your room.
Go on.

234
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,350
Alex!
We'll be up to talk
to you in a minute. Just go.

235
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:43,684
Haley!
What?

236
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,686
- Say something!
- About what?

237
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,647
Uh, I take it back!
What is going on?

238
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:51,108
These guys were gonna say
they did it too, and you were
gonna be proud of all of us.

239
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,653
Why would we do that?
I don't know what
to believe with this kid.

240
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,446
Liars! I didn't do it!

241
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,323
Well, it wasn't me.
Don't look at me.

242
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,492
Seriously?
Wait.

243
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,661
[Panting]
Nobody did it again?

244
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,704
[Groans]
No, that's fine.

245
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,499
Guess what?
Christmas is still canceled.

246
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,501
That's fine by me.

247
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,254
Let's start working
on next year.

248
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,589
Hey, and memo
to New Year's Eve...

249
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,758
and Easter-

250
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,927
Watch your back!

251
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,848
So, after I left the marines,
I just kinda traveled the world.

252
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,517
Now I go from town to town
picking up odd jobs.

253
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,143
Oh. Kinda like the Hulk.

254
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,647
[Laughs]
That's weird. That was
my nickname in the corps-

255
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:32,608
'cause of my bad temper.

256
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,779
Anyway,
thanks for having me over,

257
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,073
having me for dinner,
letting me do my laundry.

258
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,368
It's not been a good day.
[Exhales]

259
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:47,039
Um, Scott, I-I have
a confession to make.
Yeah?

260
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,625
Um, I didn't, uh-

261
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,252
I didn't clean the lint tray,

262
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,462
so, um, your clothes
might be a little pilly.

263
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,715
Oh, no problem.
That's the least of my worries.

264
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:58,759
Thanks for everything.
You guys made my day.

265
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,804
- It's the least we could do.
- What do you mean?

266
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:04,891
- I don't know... what I was saying.
- [Chuckles]

267
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,517
[Slaps Leg]

268
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,021
[Mouthing Words]

269
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,732
I just say we never tell him.
Exactly.
[Stammers]

270
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,485
We give him some money,
a hot meal, laundry.
I think we're square.

271
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,030
Agreed. Okay,
how does this thing work?

272
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,991
Yeah, I think you just press
that button right there
in the middle. Yeah.

273
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:24,035
Oh, my-
Okay. That-

274
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,745
That seems a little high,
doesn't it?

275
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,581
Yes. I'm not putting Lily in that.
It's like something astronauts train in.

276
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,876
[Jay, Knocking]
Ho, ho, ho! It's me!
Ho, ho, ho! It's me!

277
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,920
It's your dad.
Yeah.

278
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,964
Hey, Dad. Hi.
Hey, guys. Hey!

279
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,675
I brought your presents.
Aren't we seeing you tomorrow, Jay?

280
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,094
These are your Christmas Eve
gifts. You know the drill.
Oh, yeah.

281
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:44,347
You open those up before bedtime.
They're pajamas.

282
00:12:44,473 --> 00:12:47,266
Still keeping
traditions alive, huh?
Well, someone has to.

283
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:51,604
I got two Colombians at home
trying to turn Christmas
into Cinco de Mayo.

284
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,398
You know
that's Mexican, right?
Ah, burrito, "bur-right-o."

285
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,400
Christmas should be Christmas.

286
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,528
Picture on the stairs,
hot chocolate,
opening the presents.

287
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:02,615
That was supposed to be
the good thing about having
a kid in the house again.

288
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:05,242
I can have Christmas
the way we used to.
I hear you, Jay.

289
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,537
If I was home right now,
I'd be mixin' up a bathtub
full of eggnog...

290
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,790
and trying to squeeze
a greased hog into a Santa hat.

291
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:12,792
You don't think I miss that?

292
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,210
Do you?

293
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,465
The point is that those
are memories that I'll always have,

294
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,093
but now I have
the perfect opportunity...

295
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,803
to create new memories
