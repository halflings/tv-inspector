00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:55,498
If somebody says something about
my family, I'm going to-
I'm just saying.

152
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,500
You could take it
down here a little bit.
That's all.

153
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,335
Oh, yeah.
'Cause that's where
you live, down here.

154
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,463
But I live up here!
Yeah, but you don't have to be
so emotional all the time.

155
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,216
That's all I'm saying.
Manny, you're with me
on this, right?

156
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,885
I wanna tell Brenda Feldman
I love her.
Oh, for God sakes.

157
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,388
Manny, she's 16.
Oh. It's okay for you
to take an older lover?

158
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,809
Hey, watch it.
I wanna go to the mall
where she works.

159
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,062
But first I need to get
my white shirt, the silk one.

160
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,606
Okay. If that's what
you really want to do.
Seriously.

161
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,776
Not to be the evil stepdad,
but if you put on
a puffy white shirt...

162
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,778
and declare your love
for a 16-year-old,

163
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,156
you're gonna be swinging
from the flagpole in your
puffy white underpants.

164
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,409
Stop the car.
Oh, where are you going?

165
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,913
[Car Horn Honking]

166
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,292
See? You hurt his feelings.
Ah- Well, if it toughens him
up a little bit then-

167
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,003
Oh, geez.
He's picking flowers.

168
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:46,132
Manny's very passionate,
just like his father.

169
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:50,261
My first husband-
he's very handsome,
but too crazy.

170
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:55,683
It seemed like all we did was
fight and make love, fight and
make love, fight and make love.

171
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,436
One time, I'm not kidding you,
we fell out the window together.

172
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,397
[Laughing]
Which- Which one
were you doing?

173
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,149
[Chuckles]

174
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,901
I'm hearing this
for the first time.

175
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,362
This doesn't worry you?

176
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,656
She barely slept on the plane
and she's still wide awake.

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,701
- Oh, stop worrying.
- I can't.

178
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,661
That- That orphanage
was all women.

179
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,497
Maybe she just- she can't
fall asleep unless she feels
a woman's shape.

180
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,084
I guess that's possible.
So here.

181
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,295
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

182
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,548
Yes, I've gained
a few extra pounds while
we were expecting the baby,

183
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,092
which has been
very difficult.

184
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,305
But apparently your body does
a nesting, very maternal,
primal thing...

185
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:38,809
where it retains nutrients-
some sort of
molecular physiology thing.

186
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,769
But that's science.

187
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,440
You can't-
You can't fight it, so-

188
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,362
- I'm not saying anything.
- You're saying everything.

189
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,199
Count to three.
One, two-

190
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,576
Three.
Okay.

191
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,078
Oh, Cam. This is beautiful.
Oh, my God.
Do you love it?

192
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,914
Yes, I-

193
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,624
What the hell is that?

194
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,170
I had Andre do it
while we were gone.
Is that us, with wings?

195
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,631
We're floating above her,
always there to protect her.

196
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,258
Okay. Well, that's
reassuring, right, Lily?

197
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,511
Yes, we tore you away from
everything you know, but don't
worry, things are normal here.

198
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,722
Your fathers
are floating fairies.
No, can you call Andre,

199
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,058
have him paint something
a little less gay?

200
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,811
By the way, we need
to stop having friends
with names like Andre.

201
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:24,939
Redheaded dad
is angry daddy.
No, I'm not.

202
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,983
Yes, you are.
Even Pepper pointed it out on
the way home from the airport.

203
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,069
Okay, that's another one-
Pepper.

204
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,071
Okay, what's up?

205
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,282
All right, look. I-

206
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:39,203
I- I never told my family
we were adopting a baby.

207
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,580
And-
I know.

208
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,292
You do?
Yeah, and I don't blame you.
I know your family.

209
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:47,544
You'd tell 'em. They'd say
something judgmental.

210
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,338
Exactly.
You'd get mad.

211
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,840
I know. And then something that's
supposed to be nothing but joyful...

212
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,550
suddenly turns into this huge fight.

213
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,804
And who wants a big,
emotional scene like that?
Thank you. Thank you.

214
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,098
I'm so-
I'm so relieved you understand.

215
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,433
I invited them over
for dinner tonight.

216
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,603
What?
I had to.

217
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,981
This would have gone on forever.
You're an avoider.

218
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,650
No. No. No.
Cam, I'm calling them
right now and canceling.

219
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:13,404
No, you're not.
You're telling your family
you adopted a baby, tonight.

220
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,657
And you do have
avoidance issues.
Even Longinus said so.

221
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,451
Are- Are you really
not hearing these names?

222
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,498
[Doorbell Rings]
[Haley] Don't answer it!
I'll get it!

223
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,258
Hi.
Hey, you must be Dylan.

224
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,969
Hey.
Dylan. Yeah.
I'm Haley's mother.

225
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,137
Hey.
Mm-hmm.

226
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,472
Come on. Let's go.
[Clears Throat]
Okay. Um-

227
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,933
Hang on one second.
Um- Whoa.

228
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,437
Dylan, you're still
in high school?

229
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeah, I'm a senior.
A senior.
Okay. Cool.

230
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:53,944
Hey, Phil. Sweetie. Honey.
He is Dylan, and he is a senior.

231
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,780
[Whispers]
You have to scare him.

232
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,616
Let me meet this "playa."

233
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:01,702
Phil Dunphy, yo.

234
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,250
It's like that. You just-
You just stare down at 'em,

235
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,502
let the eyes do the work.

236
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,504
Your mouth might be saying,
"Hey, we cool,"

237
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,548
but your eyes are like,
"No, we not."

238
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,426
"Nice to meet you."
"No, it's not."

239
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,179
"It's all good."

240
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:22,348
[Mutters]

241
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,599
Yo.
Yo.

242
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,603
Okay, I see you two guys-
Wait, wait, wait.

243
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,314
You two-

244
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,860
You two keep it real,
know what I mean, son?

245
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,653
Not really.

246
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,739
Please, stop.
That's cool.

247
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,492
Ow.
Oh, God! That's my back.
Oh, honey. Sweetheart.

248
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,869
Ow! Oh!
I slipped in the baby oil.

249
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,164
"Oh, where you from
originally?"

250
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,751
"I could defeat you if it came to
a physical confrontation."

251
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,587
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I don't know about this.
Should I call a doctor?

252
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,423
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay.

253
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,717
You're very strong, homes.
Thanks.

254
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,595
Okay. Nice-
Nice soft landing.
There you go.

255
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,139
Okay.
I am on my side though.
Okay, let's go. Come on.

256
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,892
So just flip me right back,
and we're good.
[Sighs]

257
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,727
We'll be good.

258
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,439
I just need to get
flipped right on my back,
and we should be fine. So-

259
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,695
Brenda Feldman.

260
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,908
What is that?
A poem I have written
for Brenda Feldman.

261
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,746
- Of course it is.
- I put my thoughts into words
and now my words into action.

262
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,290
Hey, I'll give you 50 bucks
not to do this.

263
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,001
I'm 11 years old.
What am I gonna do
with money?

264
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,212
What are you gonna do
with a 16-year-old?

265
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:39,925
He's like a bullfighter.
Mmm.
You ever see a bullfight?

266
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,886
- I can't watch this.
- You're in such a bad mood.

267
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,432
And I know why.
It's because that man
thought you were my father.

268
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,891
No.
Yes.

269
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,228
No.
When you say "No" like that,
it's always "Yes."

270
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,565
Come on. We're in the mall.
Let's get you, like,
some younger clothes.

271
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,693
There's a store there.
I don't need
any younger clothes.

272
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,196
And I don't care what
some jackass in a pair
of ripped jeans thinks about me.

273
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,948
Good. You shouldn't.

274
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,159
You should only care
what I think.

275
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,911
I love you,
and I don't care
how old you are.

276
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,290
So stop being a gloomy goose
and stop being so hard on Manny.

277
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,292
The only reason
I'm hard on Manny...

278
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,961
is just because
I don't wanna see him
make a fool of himself.

279
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:19,047
And I can smell that
hair goo of his from here.

280
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,092
Look, I don't know what's gonna
happen to him over there.

281
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:25,888
But you're his family now,
and that means only one thing-

282
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:30,476
You be the wind in his back,
not the spit in his face.

283
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:33,437
What?
It's something
my mom always says.

284
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,773
It's gorgeous in Spanish.
Look, he's there.

285
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,616
She has a boyfriend.
Oh, I'm sorry,
mi niño.

286
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,618
I gave her my heart,

287
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,954
she gave me a picture of me
as an old-time sheriff.

288
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,456
Oh.

289
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,792
That was pretty stupid of me,
wasn't it?
No, mi amor.

290
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,212
It was brave.
Right, Jay? Brave.

291
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,381
W-Well, you'll know better
next time.

292
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,425
Come on.
Let's get a pretzel.

293
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,971
Mentira.
A mí sí me gusta.

294
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,728

00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,794
Anyhow, Mitch, uh-

442
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,463
- No, Dad, it's- it's-
- [Lily Crying]

443
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,465
I got her.
I got her.
Oh, she's crying.

444
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,050
She wants her grandpa!
She wants her daddy!

445
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,260
Do you wanna meet Grandpa?
What? Are you kidding?

446
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:48,306
She's one of us now.
Let me see the little pot sticker.
[Chuckling]

447
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,810
Hey, you're a cutie,
aren't you?

448
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,397
Ah. Look at this.
[All Fussing]

449
00:21:55,481 --> 00:22:00,151
[Jay]
We're from different worlds,
yet we somehow fit together.

450
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,654
Love is what binds us,

451
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,699
through fair or stormy weather.

452
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,326
I stand before you now
with only one agenda-

453
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,079
"To let you know
my heart is yours,

454
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,540
Feldman comma Brenda."

455
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,460
I mean, seriously.

456
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,132
Luke, so far,
hasn't beaten me
in basketball.

457
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,426
It's 2-0. 2-0.
Okay. Okay.

458
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,678
[Grunting]

459
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,931
Get that weak stuff
out of my kitchen!
Dad, stop it!

460
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,058
Can you do me a favor?
Just grab-

461
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,602
Ooh! How's the weather
down there?

462
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,105
But when the day comes
that he does win-

463
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,107
if- you know- if/when-

464
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,359
he beats me,
I'm just gonna be like,

465
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,403
"Well done. Well done."

466
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,780
Just, like, let him-
Just support him...

467
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,782
in- in- in that kind of stuff.

468
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,953
I mean, I'd probably want to go,
like, two out of three and just
see what happens there, but-

469
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:57,834
