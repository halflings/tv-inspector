1
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:11,306
Honey, I thought you were gonna
take out the garbage.

2
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:17,474
Getting it.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,150
I was gonna get it.

4
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,508
- Dylan.
- Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

5
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:32,214
- I'm just waiting for Haley.
- Did you ring the bell?

6
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:35,081
I texted. She said
she'd be down in just a minute.

7
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:37,828
- Oh, great. Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

8
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:40,248
D-Money!

9
00:00:40,645 --> 00:00:42,624
Chillin' with Dylan the villain.

10
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:45,151
- "D" to the "y" to the...
- Hey, Mr. Dunphy.

11
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,852
Come on in. You're just in time
to catch the end of the game.

12
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:49,977
I'm not really a baseball guy.

13
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,908
- Haley says hi.
- I was just being facetious.

14
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:54,649
I'll catch you up.

15
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,259
Sit it. Park it.

16
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:59,279
Come on, I don't bite.

17
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:02,652
Kidding.

18
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:03,937
I'm kidding.

19
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:07,644
Okay, see that guy? He's the tying run.
Interesting story about him.

20
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,876
He's been stuck
on second base forever,

21
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:12,510
and I'm pretty sure
he's gonna try and steal third,

22
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:16,575
which is justa terrible, terrible idea.
How are you and Haley doing?

23
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,943
I wish I could stay home
with you and fly toy airplanes.

24
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:29,463
These aren't toy airplanes. These are
models, and they're very complicated.

25
00:01:29,645 --> 00:01:32,963
You want to fly one of these,
you got to be familiar with airfoil,

26
00:01:33,088 --> 00:01:36,720
drag, lift, and thrust, and these
are all principles of aerodynamics.

27
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,938
The box says, "12 and up."

28
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:40,682
What?!

29
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:45,600
You can fly planes with Jay next time.
Today you have to spend time with Luke.

30
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,501
- Why?
- His mother invited you, so you go.

31
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,580
Family needs to be close,
right, Jay?

32
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,894
I'm pretty sure this is a typo.

33
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,989
<i>Men need their hobbies.
Manny's father had many hobbies,</i>

34
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,360
like hiking in the desert,

35
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,911
that kind of skiing
that they drop you from the...

36
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:04,144
- How do you say in english? The...
- Helicopter.

37
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,922
Once, on a dare,
he even boxed with an alligator.

38
00:02:08,047 --> 00:02:09,830
Wrestle.
You wrestle.

39
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:13,323
- You can't box with alligators.
- Are you sure?

40
00:02:13,448 --> 00:02:15,730
How would they get the gloves
on those little claws?

41
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,531
Aren't they like tiny, little hands?

42
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,057
- I forgot what we were talking about.
- Anyways,

43
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:24,723
hobbies are important for the men,

44
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:26,711
whether you're risking your life

45
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:29,636
or flying little planes
from a safe distance.

46
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,376
- Wait, what are you doing?
- We're gonna buy some diapers.

47
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,991
It'll just take a second.

48
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:39,415
This is Costco.

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,470
Yeah, which is where we buy diapers.

50
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,587
Since when?

51
00:02:42,712 --> 00:02:45,593
Do you rember when we adopted
that baby a few months back?

52
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:46,768
Since then.

53
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,042
Mitchell is a snob.

54
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,262
No, I'm discerning.

55
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:56,313
Official slogan for snobs.

56
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,365
When we first met, he wouldn't even
look at me because I was

57
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,990
a hick from the farm in Missouri
and he's a big city mouse.

58
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,756
Who says "city mouse"?

59
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:06,977
Country mice.

60
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,704
I think I'm gonna
go wait in the car.

61
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,235
On your way out,
can you grab the garbage?

62
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,629
- I got it.
- Okay, we got it.

63
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,889
- He's a little jumpy.
- Go figure.

64
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:23,872
A teenage boy doesn't want to hang out
with his girlfriend's dad.

65
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,955
I thought we were past all that.
I'm all about...

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,326
I'm all about taking it
to the next level.

67
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:30,326
Really?

68
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,544
I thought you were all about
keeping it real.

69
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:35,681
The whole point of keeping it real
is so you can take it to the next level.

70
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:37,049
Did you not know that?

71
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,856
You haven't exactly taken it
to the next level with my dad.

72
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:43,055
- What are you talking about?
- We've been married for 16 years,

73
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:45,301
and you still walk on eggshells
around him.

74
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:46,350
What?!

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,830
Are you kidding?

76
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,104
Jay and I are total buds.

77
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,285
You want to just hang out?

78
00:03:57,006 --> 00:03:59,418
Brought six friends, so that just...

79
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:01,661
Let's...

80
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:05,942

82
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,978
Manny brought his favorite game
to play with Luke.

83
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:21,505
It's called "Empire."

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,638
You use strategy to expand territories
and take over the world.

85
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,863
Luke is gonna love that.
He's out back playing.

86
00:04:27,988 --> 00:04:30,248
Do you need me to get you something
while I'm out shopping?

87
00:04:30,373 --> 00:04:32,532
That's such a nice offer,
but I think we're good. Thanks.

88
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:34,815
What about this?

89
00:04:35,117 --> 00:04:37,109
You don't even say hello
to Gloria and Manny?

90
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:38,744
Hi, Gloria and Manny.

91
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:41,915
- Okay, mom, what about this?
- No, you're wearing a dress.

92
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,551
Mom, come on!

93
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:46,212
What? It's gonna kill you to look
like a girl for one afternoon?

94
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:49,171
It's a wedding for some friend of yours
that I never even heard of.

95
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,590
It's non negotiable.
You can borrow a dress of Haley's again.

96
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,665
That sends an ugly message...

97
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,168
That I'm Haley.

98
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,046
You know, instead of trying
to force me to wear a dress,

99
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,633
why don't you worry about
getting Luke to wear some pants?

100
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:03,842
What?

101
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,399
Why does he do this?

102
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,017
Pants! Come on!

103
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:17,774
<i>Jay and I are buds, for sure,</i>

104
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:20,985
but with kind of
an invisible asterisk.

105
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:24,263
He's not, uh...
He's not a talker...

106
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:26,123
or a hugger.

107
00:05:27,589 --> 00:05:30,089
Once, he ran over my foot
with his car.

108
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,525
To be fair,
he had just given up smoking.

109
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,500
But, basically, we're buds.

110
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:40,475
Do you have to just stand there?
You're making me feel uneasy.

111
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:46,178
Oh, for God's sake, sit here.

112
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:49,157
Hold this wing like this
while I adjust this.

113
00:05:50,924 --> 00:05:52,124
Come on. Here.

114
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:03,833
Not too hard.

115
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,480
Why don't you come shopping with me?

116
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:11,994
Maybe I can help you find
something that you like.

117
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:14,790
That's a really nice offer,
but it's not really her thing.

118
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,125
Actually, I'd love to go.

119
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,921
See, you don't know what my thing is.
You have no idea what my thing is.

120
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,341
I know what your thing is.
Your thing is to provoke,

121
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,030
just like your sister's thing
is to never come out of her room,

122
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,690
and your brother's thing...
Well, there's your brother's thing.

123
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:33,593
Put 'em on!

124
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:37,573
<i>The thing about me and Jay is</i>

125
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:39,744
our relationship's always been stuck

126
00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:42,319
in that primal place
where it started.

127
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,894
You know, he's the old silverback
protecting his females.

128
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,402
Then along comes this younger,
stronger gorilla,

129
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:49,483
swinging in, beating his chest.

130
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:52,095
Naturally,
the ape ladies come running,

131
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,266
presenting
their nice scarlet behinds.

132
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:57,231
Papa ape wants to stop all that,
but he can't.

133
00:06:57,356 --> 00:06:58,797
That's... that's life.

134
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,322
I'm not the enemy.

135
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,297
The enemy is poachers.

136
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:09,642
That'll do it.

137
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,192
Don't touch it.

138
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,779
All right.

139
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:24,067
- You want to go fly it?
- Sure.

140
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:30,708
I got the toothpaste and the soap.

141
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,402
Good. Now we can open
that general store.

142
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:36,212
- We were just here to get diapers.
- We had a saying on the farm.

143
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:40,327
If you bring the mule to the market...
I feel you rolling your eyes at me.

144
00:07:41,084 --> 00:07:43,571
We met at one of Pepper's
legendary game nights.

145
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,013
I remember Mitchell
because he kept rolling his eyes

146
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:48,853
- every time I would get boisterous.
- I did not!

147
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,245
A little bit.

148
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,488
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

149
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:56,459
We were playing charades, and
I had no idea how to act out my clue,

150
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,984
and all I could think of
to do was...

151
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,459
- Without missing a beat, Cam says...
- "Casablanca."

152
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,877
- All I did was this...
- "Casablanca."

153
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,777
"Casablanca."

154
00:08:09,124 --> 00:08:11,123
Can we get the diapers
and get out of here?

155
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,544
Fine, but I want to stop by
the wine section first.

156
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:16,244
Wait. There's a wine section?

157
00:08:16,423 --> 00:08:18,240
Yeah, a really good one.
Just past the tires.

158
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,215
No way, they do not have...

159
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:21,715
Oh, my God.

160
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,446
Oh, my... Cam. Cam.

161
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:26,765
The paper shredder I wanted, huh?
Confetti and crosscut.

162
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:32,732
Oh, my God, amazing.

163
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:40,432
What is this place?

164
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:46,524
Those cookies smell like heaven.
Your own recipe?

165
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:49,486
No, I just throw them in the oven.

166
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,613
And added the secret ingredient
of caring?

167
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:52,945
Sure.

168
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:55,635
So, you and Luke having a good time?

169
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,005
I don't know.
He won't come out of his box.

170
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,405
Maybe I'll just stay here and
spend some time with my sister.

171
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,669
Right, I guess, technically,
I would be your stepsister.

172
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:08,368
My mother says we are never
to use the word "step"

173
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:11,675
because it means "not real,"
and we are a real family.

174
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,411
So, what is the matter, Claire?

175
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:17,806
What?

176
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,134
You seem sad.

177
00:09:21,153 --> 00:09:23,963
It's just stuff with Alex.
You know, kid stuff.

178
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:25,199
Ugh, kids.

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,358
You don't have to tell me.
My school is full of them.

180
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:34,249
I was thinking, after lunch,
we can go and do a little shopping.

181
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,867
- I'm not getting a dress.
- I don't care. I'm not your mother.

182
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,996
- I know. You're my grandmother.
- Step-grandmother.

183
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:45,044
Anyways, today,
think of me as a girlfriend.

184
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:48,120
Two girls out
for an afternoon of fun.

185
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:52,025
What do you usually do
with your girlfriends?

186
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:54,603
I don't know. We go out.
We talk,

187
00:09:55,022 --> 00:09:57,222
- drink wine.
- Can I drink wine?

188
00:09:58,659 --> 00:09:59,759
Some friend.

189
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:03,027
You can still
talk to me about anything.

190
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:05,656
Yeah, adults always say that,
but they don't mean it.

191
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,463
When my mom says I can ask her anything,
I really can't.

192
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:11,088
She just freaks out.

193
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:13,183
I won't freak out.

194
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:14,542
Shoot.

195
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,480
- How many men have you slept with?
- Eight. Next.

196
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:27,751
Now can I try it?

197
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:33,173
I should get one of those.
I've always loved planes.

198
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:36,384
If things had gone differently
in my life, I would have been a pilot.

199
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,920
What would happen if you turned the
remote off and then back on real fast?

200
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:43,595
Yeah, you would have been
a great pilot.

201
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,632
So, can you do a loop-de-loop?

202
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:49,427
- If I wanted to.
- No way! Can I try it?

203
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,810
I can see why you like this.
It's so peaceful.

204
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,743
It's like the whole world just...

205
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,368
disappears out here.

206
00:11:04,295 --> 00:11:06,764
- I remember this one summer...
- I'll tell you what.

207
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:10,353
There's a trick, "threading the needle."
Claire and Mitch played at it as kids.

208
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:12,087
- You wanna try?
- How does it go?

209
00:11:12,265 --> 00:11:14,097
You grab one of those hoops
over there

210
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:17,191
and go to the far, far, far end
of the field

211
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:21,013
and stand there,
and I fly the plane through it.

212
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:23,411
That sounds awesome!

213
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,010
And then I get a chance flying it?

214
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,247
How's this?

215
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:42,252
Not far enough.
Go on.

216
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:43,653
Further down.

217
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,413
- You can't go too far.
- Right, okay. I get it. I get it.

218
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,587
- How's this?
- Good!

219
00:11:55,108 --> 00:11:56,408
Now stand still!

220
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:57,697
Don't move!

221
00:11:58,202 --> 00:11:59,365
Let's do it!

222
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:03,963
I love it!

223
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,402
I love...

224
00:12:05,696 --> 00:12:06,507
it!

225
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,572
- You drove a plane into my face.
- You must have moved.

226
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,848
- I told you to stay still.
- I didn't move!

227
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,223
Try not to talk. I want to make sure
nothing's broken.

228
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:29,126
Alex and I can't just disagree.
She has to turn everything into a fight.

229
00:12:30,045 --> 00:12:31,945
A strong, independent woman.

230
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,114
Sounds like somebody else I know.

231
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:37,528
I was never hostile, though.
This whole thing with the dress...

232
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:39,570
Never had this problem with Haley.

233
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:42,458
Maybe Alex doesn't want
to compete with her big sister.

234
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,084
Maybe she's trying
to create her own identity.

235
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,687
- Put her in a dress and she disappears.
- For one afternoon.

236
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:51,962
I wouldn't give up being myself
for even one second.

237
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:56,042
Sometimes it's hard to remember
you're only 10 years old.

238
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:57,693
And three-quarters.

239
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,949
- <i>It's Mitchell. Do you need olives?</i>
- Olives?

240
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,699
- <i>Really good olives.</i>
- Yeah.

241
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,919
You got it.

242
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:10,035
Mitchell, I found the diapers.
They're over here.

243
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,049
Cameron, guess what I found.

244
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,235
Coffins.

245
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,627
They sell baby formula,
and they sell coffins.

246
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:18,881
You can literally buy everything
you need from birth to death.

247
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:22,218
Look at these diapers.
Look how cheap they are!

248
00:13:22,595 --> 00:13:25,223
We should get enough for like
the next year or two, right?

249
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:27,098
Where would we keep them?

250
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:31,195
- They sell sheds.
- Really? You want to buy a diaper shed.

251
00:13:31,363 --> 00:13:33,655
We're those guys now?
The guys with the diaper shed?

252
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:37,492
- Just grab two more.
- I'm not grabbing two more. Time to go.

253
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,178
Come on. We need a...

254
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:42,691
Excuse me. Where did you
get that flatbed thing?

255
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:44,692
- Over there.
- Go grab one of those.

256
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,667
- Really?
- Yeah. Get two.

257
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,526
I'm in the applesauce aisle!

258
00:13:52,651 --> 00:13:54,940
So, anyways, after charades,
we went out for coffee,

259
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:57,183
and I learned that he loves art,

260
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:00,265
he plays the piano,
he speaks French.

261
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,471
<i>Un peu.</i>

262
00:14:01,596 --> 00:14:03,596
So, you know, I misjudged him.

263
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,677
I'm sort of like Costco.

264
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:08,718
I'm big, I'm not fancy,
and I dare you to not like me.

265
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:10,849
And I'm kind of more like that...

266
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,272
What is the name of that little shop
we went to in Paris?

267
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,897
You are such a snob.

268
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:21,165
"Casablanca."

269
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,315
I have a small flower on my ankle

270
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,840
and a tiny,
little butterfly on my...

271
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,232
Thigh.

272
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:30,761
How high up?

273
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,241
Very high.

274
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,729
Did you do it to look sexy?
No, did you do it for a guy?

275
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,204
Does grandpa like it?

276
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:38,879
No, no, and yes.

277
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,904
That's gross.

278
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,023
Let's go back to your piercings.

279
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:48,137
I've answered enough of your questions.
Now it's your turn to answer one.

280
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:49,705
What is it?

281
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,805
Why you don't want to wear a dress?

282
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:55,070
Because I don't want to look
like Haley and her stupid friends.

283
00:14:55,245 --> 00:14:57,608
I wear dresses,
and I don't look like Haley.

284
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:58,933
You are Haley,

285
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,093
just... 40 years older.

286
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,452
- 10.
- 20.

287
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:03,629
Deal.

288
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:07,531
- Alex, why are you fighting me on this?
- It doesn't matter if I dress up.

289
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,751
I'm not pretty like Haley and you.

290
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,851
- That's ridiculous! You're beautiful!
- I'm not.

291
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:14,276
But that's okay.

292
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:15,882
I'm the smart one.

293
00:15:16,923 --> 00:15:19,460
The cute busboy doesn't
know that you're smart.

294
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:20,428
What?

295
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:23,493
He's been smiling at you every
time he comes to the table.

296
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,718
Why do you think we are
the only people with bread?

297
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:30,062
Look, one day,

298
00:15:30,308 --> 00:15:32,973
you are going to want
to date a cute guy like that.

299
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,435
When that day comes,
you're gonna want to look beautiful,

300
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,395
and then you'll wear a dress.

301
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,691
So, you ever kiss another girl?

302
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:45,611
That's no way to talk
to your grandmother.

303
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,774
Was my mom hard on me growing up?

304
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,091
Yeah, she was, but you know what?

305
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:53,764
Back then, everything
was Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.

306
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,203
- They didn't understand...
- <i>Hola.</i> We're back.

307
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,579
How'd it go?

308
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,304
It was great.
Did you have fun with Luke?

309
00:16:01,504 --> 00:16:03,888
- Well, not...
- We had a great time.

310
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:06,998
Alex, I've been thinking, and...

311
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,303
If you don't want to wear a dress,
it's not the end of the world.

312
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:12,932
It's all right.

313
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:14,879
I bought one.

314
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,647
- Do you see how she has to provoke me?
- We'll talk about it next week.

315
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,975
Clear the way.
Coming through. Easy.

316
00:16:25,357 --> 00:16:27,412
- I need to rest my face.
- You're fine.

317
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:29,013
You'll be all right.

318
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,599
Oh, my God!

319
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,409
- Dad!
- Little accident. Nothing big.

320
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,686
- I was in a plane crash.
- What happened?

321
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,079
We were threading the needle,
and somebody moved.

322
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,869
No, I didn't.
You did it on purpose.

323
00:16:40,994 --> 00:16:43,918
That's the painkiller talking.
He's a little loopy.

324
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:46,191
- How bad is it?
- The wing is cracked,

325
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,600
- the propeller's bent, but I can...
- I mean Phil.

326
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:50,277
I was in a plane crash.

327
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:51,502
Thanks, dad.

328
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,279
I didn't ask him to be there.
He insisted.

329
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:57,724
- He took a risk. This is what happened.
- Like the time you ran over his foot?

330
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,946
- You ran over his foot?
- That was an accident.

331
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:02,646
You did it on purpose.
We all saw the tire marks on the lawn.

332
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,514
I had just quit smoking.

333
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,890
- See, you're upsetting your husband.
- Water.

334
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:12,736
You okay?

335
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,792
Gloria.
Thank God you're here.

336
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,934
Don't worry. I'm here, too.

337
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:19,241
Who's this?

338
00:17:20,662 --> 00:17:21,962
Wasn't my fault.

339
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,463
I have seen you thread
the needle a million times.

340
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:26,681
- You never miss.
- I must be getting old.

341
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:28,844
Why don't you just admit it?
You never liked Phil.

342
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,716
Put that down.
You do not get a cookie.

343
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:34,849
I like Phil. It's just that sometimes
he tries too hard, you know?

344
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:37,649
And it's just kind of...
Irritating.

345
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:40,853
Maybe he tries too hard
because you make zero effort with him.

346
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,237
You know what?
In the 16 years we've been married,

347
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:46,255
have you one time told him
that you liked him?

348
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:50,825
- Not in those exact words, no.
- No, not in any words, dad.

349
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:53,396
How do you think that makes me feel?

350
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:56,974
You've never told your son
that you love him?

351
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,335
When did we jump to "love"?

352
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,393
- And he's technically not my son.
- That means that you don't love Manny?

353
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:06,267
Sure I do.
Believe me, when I was in that park,

354
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,170
I really wished Manny was there.

355
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:11,680
For what? So that you could
fly the plane into his head?

356
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:16,238
Dad, thanks so much
for bringing Phil home.

357
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,473
I found one of your little flaps
in his hair.

358
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:26,740
- Actually, this is called an aileron.
- 'Cause that's what matters right now.

359
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:28,592
Bye, dad.

360
00:18:45,906 --> 00:18:47,806
What, are you made of China?

361
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,711
I just want you to know, I'm sorry.

362
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:56,047
And whether I missed or you moved...

363
00:18:56,172 --> 00:18:58,072
- I didn't.
- Either way...

364
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:01,090
I just want to say that I like you.

365
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,065
Really?

366
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,985
What do you like about me?

367
00:19:09,209 --> 00:19:10,609
You're a nice guy.

368
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,794
You try real hard.

369
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:15,426
I do.

370
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,908
- You're a good dad.
- I am a good dad. Come here.

371
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,575
Come here, you.

372
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:24,754
This feels so right.

373
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,239
- What's going on?
- There was a little accident,

374
00:19:30,364 --> 00:19:32,879
but Jay's telling Phil
how much he loves him.

375
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,048
Well, that's nice for Phil.

376
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,665
Great, since he's never said
anything like that to my boyfriend.

377
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,625
- Let it go.
- It's not okay.

378
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,023
Mitch is right.
You go in there, too, Cam. Come on.

379
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,683
You're kidding.

380
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:46,495
Come on in, Cam.

381
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,855
- A little hug?
- Get in here.

382
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:50,806
Say it, say it!

383
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:52,695
I like you, too, Cam.

384
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,975
- What do you like about him?
- Oh, geez.

385
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:59,145
- Where did you get that camera?
- Only the greatest store on earth.

386
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:00,743
Thanks, dad.

387
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:03,546
Manny, picture.
Get in there, too.

388
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:05,513
Get in here, <i>mi amigo</i>.

389
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,757
Stay still. Say, "cheese!"

390
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,033
Don't push it.

391
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,708
- Cheese!
- Picture!

392
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,481
Cheese! <i>Queso</i>!

393
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:16,102
- How beautiful!
- Oh, boy!

394
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,517
Doesn't it feel like his arms
could go around the world?

395
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:21,681
I think I strained something.

396
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,275
I always wanted a daughter.

397
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,440
To dress her up in pretty dresses,
do her hair,

398
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:30,931
her nails, her makeup.

399
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:36,419
No one knows this, but for
the first year of his life,

400
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,706
I made up Manny like a girl and told
everybody that he was my daughter.

401
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,639
But just for a few times.

402
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,661
I didn't want to mess with his head.

403
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:49,930
When he found the pictures, I told him
that it was his twin sister who died.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
