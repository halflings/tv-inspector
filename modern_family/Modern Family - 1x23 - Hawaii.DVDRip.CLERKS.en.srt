Aloha. Oh, wait.
Let's do it one more time.

The doggy was blocking
her face.
Yeah, go back.

No. No! No. We're not
doing it a third time.

There she is-
the prettiest white woman
on Maui. Milady.

00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:18,393
Actually, Claire and I
were supposed to go to Hawaii
for our honeymoon.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,146
Mm-hmm.
But something else came up.

7
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,481
I got pregnant with Haley.
My bad!

8
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,483
We didn't even have
a proper wedding.

9
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:27,944
We just went down to
the courthouse on a Tuesday.

10
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:31,907
The judge sentenced me to life
with no chance of parole.

11
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:34,910
You begged me to marry you.
It's true. I did.

Oh! Hold on, my bride.
Allow me! [Grunts]

Go on. Okay.

Honey, come on.
Let's turn this vacation
into a honeymoon.

Sweet pea, I'm a mom
traveling with my kids.

For me, this is not a vacation.
It's a business trip. Let's go.

Ah!
Wow!

It's beautiful.

I can't believe we have

Score! There's an iron

on these kids all day,
or else they're gonna burn.

The great thing about Cameron
is that, uh, he's adventurous, like I am.

00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,994
We-We both like to immerse
ourselves in the culture and
really get to know the locals.

We've made friends

I have a small fear

I may have exaggerated

he loves most about me, and I
can't tell him the truth now.

It would be like Lewis

150
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,715
Can you just go by yourself?
But... the lavender ranch-

151
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,051
It's- It's something two men
are meant to do together.

152
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:09,971
- On or off, folks?
- Well, I'm on.

153
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,556
I'm off.

[Door Closes]

155
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,894
Think about what you're
missing, Cam.

156
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,896
It's an entire ranch
full of lavender.

157
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,941
You're not making
the compelling case
you think you are!

158
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,406
Hey, you little monkey!

159
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,409
[Screams]
No standing around!
There you go!

160
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,745
Here goes another one!
There you go!

Here comes another one!
There you go!

[Alex Screaming]

163
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,917
I thought you were
one of ours!

164
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,919
Hey, Jay! Be careful!

165
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,172
You're gonna hurt somebody-
like you!

166
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,425
- Don't get too comfortable.
I reserved us a tennis court.
- Yay.

167
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,720
I thought that one of
the advantages of marrying
an older guy...

168
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,097
was that I was going to be
able to relax.

169
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,975
But all this swimming
and running and rowing-

170
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,812
It's just like
how some of my relatives
got into this country.

171
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,481
[Phil]
You know-
[Claire] Mmm.

172
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,192
You look prettier now
than the day we got married.
Oh, honey.

173
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,527
And you are even more handsome.
[Chuckles]

174
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,656
I did push-ups
in the bathroom.
[Laughs] You're funny.

175
00:08:09,782 --> 00:08:12,492
You're nice.
I have always been nice.

176
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,494
I've always been funny.

Well-

[Haley]
Mom! Dad!

Ignore her.
That could be anyone.
Mmm.

Phil and Claire Dunphy?

00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:29,467
Yes, Haley, honey?
What is it?

182
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm gonna go get some
shaved ice at the hotel
next door with some kids.

183
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,182
- What kids?
- Just some kids I met at the pool.

184
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,352
Okay. Um- I should go
with her and-
Claire, no.

185
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,604
You have to learn to let go.

186
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,358
Turning a family vacation
into a honeymoon
takes commitment.

187
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,904
You can do it.
Eye of the tiger.

188
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,447
Hello!

189
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,491
I should at least meet them. I-
No.

190
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:58,287
That is not eye of the tiger.

[Mouths Words, Inhales]

192
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,711
All right, Haley, honey,
go and have fun,

193
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,546
but don't get
in anybody's car...

194
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,757
and be back in time
for your grandfather's
birthday dinner, okay?

195
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,092
Thank you!
Okay!

Bye, honey!
All right!

Oh, God.

198
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,475
That feels weird
and good all at once.

199
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,478
I know. I was leaning up
against that nozzle
a minute ago.

200
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,776
- Hey.
- Hey, you're back. How was it?

201
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:32,280
Ah! Cameron, it was the most
incredible thing I've ever
seen in my entire life.

202
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,031
You know who else
was there?
Really? Who?

203
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,575
- Elton John.
- No-

204
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,411
Yes, and he was so blown away
by the beauty of it, he sat down...

205
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,496
at their lavender piano
and played "Tiny Dancer."

206
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,624
- And we bonded, because
he too likes adventure.
- Did that really happen?

207
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,710
No, that didn't really
happen. I'm just...

trying to get back at you
for bailing on me.

I'm sorry. If it means anything,
we've been relaxing here
doing nothing.

Maybe you can join us
tomorrow.
No, I can't- I just don't-

that relaxing.

I think it's because

like statues...

when, you know, the only
thing that me and Claire
could do for excitement was-

Oh. Was sit around and listen
to my skin sizzle.

Yes.

So, that's, like-
That's why, when I'm on vacation,

221
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:20,953
I want to go out and meet
the locals.

222

I want to immerse myself
in the culture, you know?

I don't want to sloth
around- Ah!

any sand left on the beach,

00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,563

to our bathroom?

about "out"?

all over the bathroom floor?

[Yawning]
I napped.
You did?

250

I haven't napped in years.
Yeah. It feels good,
doesn't it?

Mm-hmm. Good and weird.
Kinda like that one nozzle
in the infinity pool.

Is it me, or is Lily
more relaxed here?
Oh, yes.

254
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,746

she's really picking up
on our energy, you know?

It's like, if we're tense,
she's gonna be tense.

And I think we need to bring
this new energy home.

but someone used the iron
to make grilled cheese.

I had bread, I had cheese
and I had an iron.

Oh, don't worry.
I'll go have a look around.

in the ocean trying to pull
a tugboat with his teeth.

to join us.

- You're not going to like this
as much as I do,

That's awesome.

is still messier.

Hey, you.
Where you headed?

286
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,966
Well, remember earlier in the pool
when you convinced me...

287
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,134
to let Haley go next door
with complete strangers?

288
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,178
And you were totally on board.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, well,

289
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,055
she got drunk, and now
she's upstairs throwing up.

00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,058
But she's just a kid.
Who would serve her?
We did, honey.

291
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:34,313
On a silver platter.
You convinced me to relax and
let go, and now this happens.

I'm sorry, but we
shouldn't feel bad...

We have kids.
You have got to let this go.

From now on, I am not losing
sight of them for two seconds.
