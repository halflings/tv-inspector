1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,960
Kids, breakfast!

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,210
Kids?

3
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:06,481
Phil, would you get them?

4
00:00:06,482 --> 00:00:07,920
Yeah, just a sec.

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,810
That is so,
Kids, get down here!

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,960
Why are you guys yelling at us,
when we're way upstairs, just text me.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,500
Alright, That's not gonna happen,
and, wow, you're not wearing that outfit.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,410
What's Wrong with it?
- Honey, do you have anything to say to you're daughter...

9
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,350
... about her skirt?

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,500
Sorry?
Oh yeah, that looks really cute sweetheart!

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,000
Thanks!
- No, it's way to short, people know you're a girl...

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,580
... you don't need to prove it to them.

13
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:38,830
Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:39,830
I got it.

15
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,420
Where's the babyoil?
- It's on our bedside tip...

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,690
...I Don't know, find it.

17
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,870
Come on!

18
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,440
I... was out of control growing up,
there, you know, i said it.

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,770
I, just don't want my kids to make
the same bad mistakes i made.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,460
If hayley never would exhibit on a beach in florida,
half naked... I've done my job.

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,640
OUR job.
- Right...

22
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,500
I've done our job.

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,480
That was a penalty!

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,130
Gloria, there Owen's six,
let's take it down a notch.

25
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,880
We're, verry different.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,610
He's from the city.
He has big business.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,430
I'm come from a small village,
very poor, but very very beautiful.

28
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,520
It's the number one village in north-columbia,
before al the...

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,920
... what's the word?
- Murders.

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,190
Yes, the murders.

31
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,680
Manny, stop him!

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,300
Dammit, manny!

33
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,080
Come on, coach!
You've gotta take that kid out!

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,740
You wanna take him out?

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,260
How about I take you out!?

36
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,630
Honey, honey...

37
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,360
Why don't you worry about you're son!
He'd spend the first half with his hands in his pants!

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,610
I wanted to tell her that for the last six weeks...

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,890
I'm Josh, Brian's dad.
- Hi, I'm Gloria Pritchett...

40
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,470
... Manny's mother.
Oh, this must be you're dad.

41
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,580
Her dad?
Uh, no, no, that's funny.

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,750
Actually no, I'm her husband!
Don't be fooled by the...

43
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
Give me a second here.

44
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,800
She's adorable!
- Oh, thank you!

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,640
Hey precious...
- Hello.

46
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,140
We've just adopted her from vietnam
and we're bringing her home for the first time.

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,030
She's an angel.
You and you're wive must be thrilled!

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,400
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
daddy needed snacks.

49
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,160
So, what are we talking about?

50
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,960
We have been together for...
five years now?

51
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,350
And we've decided we really
wanted to have a baby...

52
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,150
... so, we initially asked one of our
lesbian friends to be a surrogate

53
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,750
Then we figured, they already mean enough,
can you imagine one of them pregnant?

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
No, thank you.

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
You saw that right?
Everybody fonding up to lillian, then you walk on...

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
... and suddenly it's all

57
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm gonna give a speech.
- You are not giving a speech ...

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,790
... you gonna stuck with this people for the next five hours!
- You'r right, it's okay, i'm sorry.

59
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,790
Honey, look at that baby with those creampuffs.

60
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,550
Okay, excuse me. But this baby would be growin up
in a crowded orphanage if it wasn't for us creampuffs ...

61
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,470
... and you know what, to all of you who judge,
hear this,

62
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:48,950
love knows no race, creed or gender and
shame on you! You small minded, ignorant fe...

63
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,200
Mitchel?
- What?

64
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,430
She's got the creampuffs.

65
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,160
We would like to pay for everyone's headset's.

66
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,750
MODERN FAMILY
SEASON 1 EPISODE 1

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,210
Buddy, why do you keep getting stuk like this?

68
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,800
I can get out this time.

69
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm just gonna say it...
he needs to be checked by a specialist.

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,720
There! Be free,
Excalibur!

71
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm having a friend over today.
- Who?

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,900
You don't know him.
- Him?

73
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,200
Oeh, a boy! You gonna kiss him?
- Shut up

74
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,780
Luke, Alex, why don't you take it outside, okay?
- And do what?

75
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,200
Fighting a son, it would be a nice change.
I'm kidding!

76
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,930
Who's the boy?
- His name is Dylan ...

77
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,020
... I might as well just tell him not to come,
because you guys are just going to embarrase me again.

78
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,900
Hang on a second, you're fifteen,
it's the first time you've had a boy over

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm bound to be a little suprised, but...
We're not gonna embarasse you!

80
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,480
I'm better go charge the camcorder.

81
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,550
I'm kidding! Come on!
Who are you talking to?

82
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,010
I'm a cool dad. That's my thang.

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,100
I surf the web, i text LOL
Laugh Out Loud,

84
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,710
OMG, Oh My God,

85
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,710
WTF, Why The Face.

86
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,830
You know,
i know all the dances to High School Musical, so.

87
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,860
MOM! DAD!
- What happend?

88
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Luke just shot me!
- I didn't mean to!

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,350
Are you okay?
- No, the little bitch shot me!

90
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,200
Language!
The're only plastick bb's!

91
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,700
It was an accident!

92
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,190
What did I tell you what happened if you got him a gun?
Deal with this!

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,750
Buddy... Uncool.

94
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,080
That's it?

95
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,770
No, the agreement was that,
if he shoots someone ...

96
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,770
... you shoot him.

97
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,770
We were serious about that?

98
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,200
Yes, we were and now you have to follow through.

99
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm so sorry!
- Liar.

100
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,240
Go!
- He's got a birthday party.

101
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,630
What's more importand here dad?

102
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,730
You can shoot him afterwards, he'll be home at two.
- I can't shoot him at two, showing our house at two.

103
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,730
What about three?

104
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,600
No, he's at a soccergame at three, and then...
Oh, we gotta leave for that dinner thing in five.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,380
4:15, you can shoot him at 4:15.
- Yeah, I guess that works for me.

106
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,530
Shoot Luke.
- Sorry dude, it's on the calender

107
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
Oh, come on!

108
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,660
I'm quitting soccer, it is a game for children.

109
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,110
No, you're not quitting. You would've stoped
that goal if you weren't staring at that little girl.

110
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,520
She is not a girl, She is a woman.

111
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,400
You know Gloria, that blowup with that other mom,
why do you have to do things like that?

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,090
If someone sais somthing about my family,
i'm going to... - I'm just ...

113
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,090
... saying you could take it down here a little bit.
- Well yeah, but that's when you live down here ...

114
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
... but i live up here!

115
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:01,730
You don't have to be so emotional all the time,
that's all I'm saying.

116
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:05,504
Manny, you're with me on this, right?
- I wanna tell Brenda Feldman I love her.

117
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:06,288
Oh, for God's sake.

118
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,747
Honey, she's 16.
- Oh, it's okay for you to take another lover?

119
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:10,749
Watch it!

120
00:07:10,755 --> 00:07:12,752
I want to go to the mall where she works.

121
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:16,075
But first we need to get my white shirt,
the silk one.

122
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,275
Okay, if that's what you really want to do.

123
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:24,010
Seriously, not to be the evil stepdad, but if you put on
a puffy white shirt and declare your love for a 16 year old ...

124
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:27,389
... you're gonna be swinging from the flagpole
in you're puffy white underpants!

125
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,391
Stop the car!

126
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Where you going?

127
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:38,445
You hurt his feelings.
- Well, if it toughens him up a littlebit, then ...

128
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,159
... oh, jeez, he's picking flowers!

129
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:48,370
Manny is verry pasioned, just like his father.
My first husband is very handsome but, to crazy.

130
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:54,094
It seemd like all what we did was,
fight and make love.

131
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:57,200
One time, i'm not kidding you,
we fell out of the window together.

132
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,395
Which one we're you doing?

133
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,691
I'm hearing this for the first time!

134
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,234
This doesn't worry you?

135
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:11,035
She barely slept in the plane, and she's stil wide awake.
- Oh, stop worrying!

136
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:16,390
That orphinage, it was all woman. Maybe she cannot
fall asleep unless she feels a woman's shape.

137
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,791
I guess that's possible.

138
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,538
So, here.
- What the hell is that suppose to mean?

139
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:25,845
Yes, i've gained a few extra pounds
while we expecting the baby.

140
00:08:26,655 --> 00:08:31,290
Which has been verry difficult.
But, apparently you're body does a nesting, very maturnal ...

141
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:36,992
... primal thing, were it retaines nutrisians.
Some sort of molecular fysiology thing.

142
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,032
But that's science,
you can't fight it.

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,805
I'm not saying anything.

144
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,378
You're saying everything.

145
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,864
Count to three, one, t...
- Three.
- Okay.

146
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,071
O My God, do you love it?
-Yes, I...

147
00:08:58,443 --> 00:08:59,565
What the hell is that?

148
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:02,000
I had Andre do it when we we're gone.

149
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:03,044
Is that us?

150
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,455
With wings?

151
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,940
We're floating above her,
always there to protect her.

152
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:10,707
Well, that's reassuring, right Lilly?
Yeah, we tore you away from everyting you know but ...

153
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,710
... don't worry, things are normal here.
You're fathers are floating fairy's!

154
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:17,410
Can you call Andre? Have him
paint someting a little less gay?

155
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,925
We need to stop having friends with names
like Andre.

156
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,349
Redheaded dad, is angry daddy.
- No I'm not. - Yes, you are.

157
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,600
Even pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport.
- Okay, that's anotherone pepper!

158
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:29,209
Okay, wat's up?

159
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,746
I ...

160
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:36,670
I never told my family we were adopting a baby.

161
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:41,020
I know.
- You do?

162
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:43,372
And I don't blame you, I
know your family.

163
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,475
You tell them,
they say something judgementally.

164
00:09:46,783 --> 00:09:47,476
Exactly!
- You get mad.

165
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:51,421
I know, and it's supposed to be nothing,
but joyfull suddenly turns into this huge fight.

166
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,840
Who wants a big emotional scene like that?

167
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:56,547
Thank you, i'm so reliefed you understand.

168
00:09:57,169 --> 00:09:59,274
I invited them over for dinner tonight.

169
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,543
What?
- I had to!

170
00:10:02,544 --> 00:10:05,116
This would have gone on forever.
You're an avoider.

171
00:10:05,116 --> 00:10:08,900
No, I'm calling them now, I'm cancelling.
- No, you're not!

172
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:11,500
You're telling your family you've adopted a baby, tonight.

173
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:13,005
And you do have avoidings issues!

174
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:17,449
Are you really not hearing this things?

175
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,965
Don't answer it, i'll get it!

176
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:33,915
Heey, you must be Dylan.
- Hey, Dylan, yeah.

177
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,150
I'm Haley's mother.

178
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,367
Hey, come on, let's go.

179
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,439
Hang on one second

180
00:10:41,106 --> 00:10:45,933
Dylan... You're still in High School?
- Yeah, i'm a Senior.

181
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:51,974
Phil, sweety, honey.
He is Dylan and he is a Senior.

182
00:10:54,802 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me meet this playa.

183
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:58,862
Phil Dunphy, jo!

184
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:08,082
It's like that, you just start down on him
and let the eyes do the work.

185
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,826
You're mouth might be saying:
Hey, we cool!

186
00:11:10,455 --> 00:11:12,399
But you're eyes are like:
No, we not!

187
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:15,341
Nice to meet you!
No, it's not!

188
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:19,880
'S all good?
No, 's it is'n...

189
00:11:20,366 --> 00:11:21,366
Jo.
- Jo.

190
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,926
Okay, I've seen two guys
-Wait

191
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:26,916
You two ...

192
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,019
... two keep it real?
You k'now what it mean, son?

193
00:11:32,785 --> 00:11:34,037
Not really.

194
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:36,636
Please stop.
- That's cool!

195
00:11:37,616 --> 00:11:42,115
Oh, God, That's my back!
Owh, oh, I slipped in the babyoil.

196
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,770
Ooh, whe're you from originally?
I could defeat you if it came to a phisical confrontation!

197
00:11:49,355 --> 00:11:53,020
I don't know about this, shall I call a doctor?
- No, no, no.

198
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,885
You're verry strong homes.
- Thanks.

199
00:11:57,012 --> 00:11:59,365
Okay, nice, nice soft landing

200
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:05,940
Okay, I am on my side, so flip me right back
and we're good. We'll be good

201
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:10,436
Just need to get flipped right on my back,
we should be fine, so.

202
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:11,656
Feldman.

203
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:16,218
What is that?
- A poem i've written for Brenda Feldman.

204
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:20,338
Ofcourse that is.
- I put my toughts into words, and now my words into action!

205
00:12:20,468 --> 00:12:23,120
Ey, I give you 50 bucks not to do this.

206
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm eleven years old,
what am I gonna do with money?

207
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:27,331
What are you gonna do with a sixteen year old?

208
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:29,829
It's like a bullfight!

209
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,990
Ever seen a bullfight?

210
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:34,198
I can't watch this.

211
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,793
You're in such a bad mood.
And I know why,

212
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:41,534
It's because that man thought you were my father.
- No - Yes -NO

213
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,010
When you say no like that, it's always yes.

214
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,663
Come on, we're in the mall, let's get you
like some yougher clothes ...

215
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:50,531
... there's a store there that I know...
- I don't need any youngher clothes!

216
00:12:50,807 --> 00:12:54,107
And I don't care what some jackass in a pair
of ribbed jeans thinks about me.

217
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:57,747
Good, you shouldn't.
You should only care what I think.

218
00:12:58,264 --> 00:13:02,891
I love you, and I don't care how old you are.
So stop beeing an gloomygoos,

219
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:06,230
and stop beeing so hard on Manny.
- The only reason i'm hard on Manny ...

220
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:07,231
... is just because i don't wanna
see him make a fool of himself.

221
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:11,730
And I can smell that hairgoo of his
from here!

222
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:14,730
Look, I don't know what's gonna
happen to him over there ...

223
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,712
... but you're his family now.
And that means only one thing.

224
00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:22,440
You be there winning his back,
not to spit in his face!

225
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:24,160
What?

226
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:27,964
Something my mom always sais,
it's georgeous in spanish.

227
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,033
Look, he's there.

228
00:13:34,482 --> 00:13:35,665
She has a boyfriend.

229
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:43,395
I gave her my heart.
She gave me a picture of me as an oldtime sheriff.

230
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,892
That was pretty stupidly, wasn't it?

231
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,129
No mi amore,
it´s was brave, right Jay? Brave.

232
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,795
I.. b... you'll know better next time.
Come on! Let's get a pretzel.

233
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:07,578
Oh, excuse me, sir?
We asked all mall-walkers to stay to the right.

234
00:14:21,953 --> 00:14:24,656
Alex, get out!
MOM!

235
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,501
Alex, leave you're sister alone!

236
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:30,785
I was just getting my book, gosh!
- I know sweety, but you need to respect her privacy.

237
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:36,023
What are they doing up there?
Nothing, lying in her bed, watching a movie.

238
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:44,006
Okay... Okay... I'm making a cake for tonight,
you wanna help me with the frosting?

239
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:45,532
Sure.

240
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:54,057
So, you know if Haley got pregnant, would you ever pretend she
got mono for a few months and then tell everyone the baby's yours?

241
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:55,333
What?

242
00:14:55,334 --> 00:15:01,922
The senior at school was out sick for four months,
but she was out breastfeeding in an cleanup carwash.

243
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:10,960
Buddy, what are you wearing?
- Nothing.

244
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:14,063
No jacket, no hat.

245
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,855
How many pairs of underwear do you have on?
- One ...

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,400
... Six.

247
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,404
First of all, it would be really cool to see
Haley that fat,

248
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:27,182
and how awesome would it be to have a
fake little brother who's really my nephew.

249
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,550
Haley is not getting pregnant!

250
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:31,297
I'm just saying if.

251
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:35,575
I know, and I know you like to make trouble for your
sister but it's not gonna work this time.

252
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:38,356
You know why? 'Cause you're sister is a good girl.

253
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,555
I know, I was just like her when I was...

254
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:48,098
I want you to know, I'm not enjoying this.
This is an emportant lesson that you're leaning, so.

255
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:49,618
'S all good, keep it...

256
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:57,055
You're to close, it's gonna hurt.
- It's supposed to hurt!

257
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:58,464
And why are you smiling?

258
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:00,453
I'm... What?

259
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:16,368
Oh, forget it. I can't do this.
The point is, you're scared.

260
00:16:16,551 --> 00:16:17,794
I think you've learned you're lesson.

261
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,163
Mom?!

262
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:26,320
What are you doing?
- Hey, I was just dropping off some laundry,

263
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:26,948
this is a bad time?

264
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:27,949
Yeah...

265
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:29,663
Oh, okay.

266
00:16:31,402 --> 00:16:33,054
Can you shut the door please?

267
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,943
Actually we're just go ahead and leave that open.

268
00:16:36,156 --> 00:16:37,021
Why?

269
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,046
Because I have euh, seen this little show before:

270
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,930
Lying on the bed with a tall, senior.

271
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:45,459
one minute you're just friends, watching Falcon Crest,

272
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,196
and the next you're lying underneath the
air-hockey table with you're bra un-pocket!

273
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,443
Mom!

274
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:52,397
You hit my bone!
- It was an accident!

275
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:56,262
I tought we were friends!
- I am your friend!

276
00:16:56,507 --> 00:17:01,220
Dad?! Dad, you have got to talk to mom, she is
like completely freaking out and emberassing me.

277
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:04,100
Well, honey, you're mom isn't always
as cool about things as I...

278
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:05,767
... What is with this thing!

279
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:12,756
My dad,
isn't completely comfortable with...

280
00:17:12,974 --> 00:17:16,300
... This, ehum, he still does this thing.
It's been five years now.

281
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:20,615
And he still does this thing were he announces himself
before walking into any room were in.

282
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,676
Just to make sure he doesn't ever see us kiss.

283
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,157
Wish my mother had that system.

284
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,618
Remember?
- Not now.

285
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:33,563
I still can't beleve you did this to me!
- Would you get in the spirit of things!

286
00:17:33,564 --> 00:17:35,258
It's a celebration!

287
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,298
Oh God.

288
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:46,529
I'm gonna go get Lily ready, and I want you
to just come straight out with it, you can do this!

289
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,210
Sportsguy-chest-bump, sportsguy-chest-bump!
Do it, GO!

290
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:03,029
Heey, how are you?
Hi guys!

291
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:08,250
Well thank you, thanks.
- Don't thank us open it, dad is right behind

292
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:13,582
Knock, knock, we're here! Coming in!
- Don't worry dad, nothing gay going on here.

293
00:18:14,472 --> 00:18:16,825
May I take you're multicoloured coat
and you're bejeweled cap?

294
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,830
Yeah.

295
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:23,062
Hey Jay
- Gloria, hi! How are you?

296
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:26,410
Hi Gloria, how are you?
What a beautiful dress!

297
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you, Phil!
- Oh, Okay.

298
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,120
Phil! She said Phil, not feel!

299
00:18:34,138 --> 00:18:37,067
So how was you're trip?
- It was good, it was good actually but...

300
00:18:37,068 --> 00:18:40,390
...about that I have something that I need to tell you guys.

301
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:46,410
We didn't just go to Vietnam for pleasure.
We, kinda have some big news.

302
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,137
Oh, God, if Cam comes out there with boobs, I'm leaving!

303
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:51,565
Dad!
- I hope he didn't embarrase you, mom.

304
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,289
Don't mind her, Haley had her first boy over today,
and Phil shot him.

305
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,217
Anyway, so about a year ago.
Cam and I sort have feeling this longing for something more...

306
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:06,000
...like, maybe a baby.

307
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,234
Woooh, that's a bad idea.

308
00:19:07,235 --> 00:19:10,012
What do you mean, bad idea?
- Well, kids need a mother!

309
00:19:10,434 --> 00:19:12,330
I mean, if you two guys are bored,
get a dog!

310
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,040
We're not bored, dad!

311
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:16,908
I support you Mitchell, and tough you're not my son

312
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:22,568
I think what dad is trying to say is that,
Mitchell you're a little uptight, kids bring chaos...

313
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,165
...and you don't handle well.

314
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:28,296
That's not what's it's saying what you saying.
And it's insulting in an whole different way.

315
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,267
Okay, people, let's all chillax!

316
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:36,227
Where's uncle Cameron?
- Finally, thank you, someone who's not insulting me,

317
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:37,920
noticed he's not here.

318
00:19:38,276 --> 00:19:41,377
So, that's the big announcement.
You two broke up.

319
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:45,720
Well a baby wasn't gonna help that anyway!
Let me tell you, your'll better of, because

320
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:47,344
he was a bit of a dramaqueen.

321
00:19:47,345 --> 00:19:54,443
Stop, stop, you come into my house and you insult me
and my boyfriend who is by the way not that dramatic!

322
00:20:10,713 --> 00:20:14,096
We've adopted a baby.
Her name is Lilly

323
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:15,701
Exciting!

324
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:19,285
Just turn it off.
- I can't turn it off, it's who I am!

325
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:21,783
The music!
- Oh, yes, the music.

326
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,834
Come, say hello Lilly.

327
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:37,755
Lilly? Isn't that gonna be hard for her to say?
- Phil.

328
00:20:37,756 --> 00:20:43,572
Excuse me... Okay, I know that
I said I thought this was a bad idea.

329
00:20:43,672 --> 00:20:44,672
But...

330
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,171
What do I know?

331
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:52,869
I mean, It's not like I wrote a book on fatherhood.
I'm trying whole my life to get it right, i'm still screwing up.

332
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:55,140
Right, Manny?

333
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,732
I wrote a song about it in the car.
- Ofcourse you did.

334
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:05,062
Anyway, I'm happy for ya!
And you should know that...

335
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:10,202
...I'm not here to spit in your face,
I'm here to blow at your back.

336
00:21:12,464 --> 00:21:14,994
It's supposed to sound better in spanish.

337
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:26,684
Anyhow, Mitch.

338
00:21:28,252 --> 00:21:31,736
No, dad, it's...
I got it, I got it.

339
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,134
She want's her daddy.
- Do you wanna meet grandpa?

340
00:21:35,518 --> 00:21:38,690
You're kidding? She's one of us now,
let me see that little potsticker!

341
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:42,749
Eey, you're a cutie, aren't you!

342
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,501
We're from different worlds.

343
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:50,808
Yet we somehow fit together.

344
00:21:51,866 --> 00:21:52,866
Love is what's binds us.

345
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,737
Through fair, or stormy weather.

346
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
I stand before you now with only one agenda

347
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,846
To let you know my heart is yours.
Feldman, Brenda

348
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,425
I mean seriously!

349
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:12,500
Look, so far, he hasn't beaten me at basketball.

350
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:13,593
2-0

351
00:22:17,556 --> 00:22:20,211
Get that! Will you step out of my kitchen!

352
00:22:20,212 --> 00:22:21,212
Could you just do me a favour and just grab...

353
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:24,837
How's the weather down there?

354
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:29,155
But, when the day comes that he does win,
if, you know, if when...

355
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:30,156
...he beats me.

356
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:33,770
I'm just gonna be like,
well done! Well done!

357
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,089
Just let him, just support him.

358
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:39,801
In that kind of stuff.
I'm probably just wanna go like,

359
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,276
2 out of 3, and just see what happens there, but.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
