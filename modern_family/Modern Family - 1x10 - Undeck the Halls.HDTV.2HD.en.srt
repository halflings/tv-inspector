okay?

164
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,464
Here we go.

165
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,902
3...2...1...

166
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:12,706
Okay.
Goodbye, dunphy christmas.

167
00:06:12,774 --> 00:06:14,574
Haley, I guess
you're not getting that car.

168
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,942
I was getting a car?!

169
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,811
No, I was lying,
because that's what we do now.

170
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,247
Dunphys are liars.

171
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,964
I mean, what's with them
tossing out candy canes
after every carol?

172
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:32,466
It's pandering.

173
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,101
I think you made that clear
when you tossed them back.

174
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,936
Okay, how am I supposed to get
all this in the car?

175
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:37,137
Let me give you a hand
with that.

176
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:39,239
Uh, thanks.
Thanks -- thanks, santa.

177
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,941
Can't call me that anymore.

178
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,010
Just got canned.

179
00:06:43,077 --> 00:06:44,678
Oh. Really?

180
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,780
Guess a couple of people
complained I wasn't fat enough.

181
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:48,315
Well, that's terrible.

182
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:50,617
That'shat I get for trying not
to have a second heart attack.

183
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,219
There you go.

184
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,654
Always a way to make room.

185
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:55,856
Take it from someone
who lives in his car.

186
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:58,325
Um...Oh, well,
thank you so much.

187
00:06:58,393 --> 00:07:00,193
No problem.
Merry christmas.

188
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,528
Um, wait, wait.

189
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,697
Um, please, let me give you
a little something.

190
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:05,866
For -- for your troubles.
No, that's okay.
No, really, that's okay.

191
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:07,134
Do you really live
in your car?

192
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,236
Yeah, it's not so bad.

193
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,605
It's pretty roomy
since the wife moved out.

194
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,073
Well...

195
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,741
Why don't you come over
to our place for dinner tonight?

196
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,009
Seriously?

197
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:17,511
Yeah, it's christmas eve.

198
00:07:17,578 --> 00:07:19,780
You -- you can't spend it
in your car.

199
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:21,782
Wow, that's really nice
of you guys.

200
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,183
Listen,
can I bring anything?

201
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:25,085
Ketchup,
soy sauce, straws?

202
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,653
We're good.

203
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,556
So, uh, why don't you follow us
to our house?

204
00:07:29,624 --> 00:07:30,958
Okay.
In your house.

205
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,160
[ chuckles ]

206
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:34,661
All right.

207
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:35,829
Cameron.
What?

208
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,804
Okay, tonight 9:00 sharp,
we open one present each --

209
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,472
Pajamas,
which we sleep in.

210
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,808
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.M.,

211
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,877
Manny on the stairs
for the christmas picture.

212
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:53,480
Then we open presents.

213
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,649
In colombia,
they open presents at midnight

214
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:56,750
And stay up till morning.

215
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:58,251
I'm sure that they do,

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,220
But as you'll notice from the
absence of goats in the street,

217
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:01,822
We are not in colombia.

218
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,691
[ chuckling ]
come on, I'm kidding.

219
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,728
Why can't we mix a couple
of colombian traditions in?

220
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,197
Like what?
Like fireworks.

221
00:08:10,264 --> 00:08:11,932
Come on, you don't have
fireworks in colombia.

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,967
<i>You're trying to make me
the inocente again.</i>

223
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,302
No, we do.

224
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,471
At night, the sky is beautiful,
very christmasy.

225
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,839
That doesn't make
any sense.

226
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,241
Look, every country
has their own traditions.

227
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,876
In our culture,
for example,

228
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:24,878
The baby jesus is the one
that brings the gifts,

229
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,680
Not the santa claus.

230
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,181
But that doesn't
make sense.

231
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,650
How could a newborn baby
carry all those prents?

232
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,953
They don't even know
where their hands are.

233
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,788
At least a baby
can fit through a chimney.

234
00:08:34,856 --> 00:08:37,290
How would you sit
on the baby jesus' lap?

235
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,392
You'd squish it.

236
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,527
Manny, next year,
we'll talk about

237
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,295
Some of your little
colombian traditions, okay?

238
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:43,330
Maybe.

239
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,798
I know what "maybe" means.

240
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:47,868
It's like you're trying
to take away my whole christmas.

241
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,871
I can't believe
it's all gone.

242
00:08:50,938 --> 00:08:52,372
Dad never follows through.

243
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,108
Are you sure one of your friends
didn't burn the couch?

244
00:08:55,176 --> 00:08:56,576
Hey, don't look at me.

245
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,311
Only one of us was ever caught
playing with matches.

246
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,480
Luke.

247
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,915
That was a year ago.

248
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,517
Just admit you did it.

249
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,584
<i>You admit you did it!</i>

250
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:07,187
Okay.
Look, I have an idea.

251
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,289
Do you remember the movie
"spartacus"?

252
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:13,460
Here's what we do --

253
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:16,029
Luke, you tell mom and dad
it's your fault.

254
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,197
I didn't do it.

255
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,833
It doesn't matter,
because after you coess,

256
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:23,637
Haley and I will each confess
to the same thing.

257
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:25,272
How does that do anything?

258
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,941
They'll be so touched
that we're protecting each other

259
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:30,077
That they'll have
to bring back christmas.

260
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:32,813
That's awesome.

261
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,815
How does it work again?

262
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:36,349
We're gonna pass
into legend --

263
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,851
The parents
who canceled christmas.

264
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,186
I thought you'd be happy.

265
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:40,520
They'll write songs
about us,

266
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,089
Make one of those
christmaspecials

267
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:43,690
With those ugly little
clay people.

268
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:45,025
You're the one
who always says

269
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,260
I shouldn't be sa pushover
with the kids.

270
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:49,096
<i>So this is where you decide
to make your stand?</i>

271
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:51,264
Really, phil?
Okay, okay, look,
don't worry.

272
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:52,532
We're going
to have christmas.

273
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
We raised our kids right.

274
00:09:53,868 --> 00:09:55,535
Whoever did it
will come forward...

275
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:57,170
Or the other two
will rat them out.

276
00:09:57,238 --> 00:09:59,673
Mom? Dad?

277
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,007
Hey, luke.

278
00:10:01,075 --> 00:10:04,010
What --
what can we do for you?

279
00:10:07,515 --> 00:10:10,450
I did it.
I was playing with matches.

280
00:10:10,518 --> 00:10:11,551
I'm sorry.

281
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:13,487
You, uh --

282
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:16,123
You did the right thing
by confessing,

283
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,493
But, um...
This is bad, buddy.

284
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,528
I mean, really bad, okay?

285
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:24,097
Claire,
you want to handle this?

286
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,434
Um, luke,
why didn't you say something?

287
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,369
Mm...I don't know.

288
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:31,304
Okay, well,
your father and I

289
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,406
Are extremely disappointed
in you.

290
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:35,242
So go up to your room.

291
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,243
Go on.

292
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,477
Alex!

293
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:38,712
We'll be up to talk to you
in a minute.

294
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,013
Haley!
What?

295
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:41,915
Say something!
About what?

296
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,917
I take it back!
What is going on?

297
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:45,719
These guys were gonna say
they did it, too,

298
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:47,187
And you were gonna
be proud of all of us.

299
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,421
Why would we do that?

300
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:49,923
I don't know what to believe
with this kid.

301
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:51,525
Liars!
I didn't do it!

302
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:53,593
Well, it wasn't me.
Don't look at me.

303
00:10:53,661 --> 00:10:54,561
Seriously?

304
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,163
Wait.

305
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,898
Nobody did it again?

306
00:10:57,965 --> 00:10:59,966
No, that's fine.

307
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,736
Guess what --
christmas is still canceled.

308
00:11:02,803 --> 00:11:04,871
That's fine by me.

309
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,207
I'll start working on
next year.

310
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:11,578
Hey, and memo
to new year's eve and easter --

311
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:14,214
Watch your back!

312
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:17,851
So, after I left the marines, I
just kind of traveled the world.

313
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,554
Now I go from town to town
picking up odd jobs.

314
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,522
Oh,
kind of like the hulk.

315
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,890
[ chuckles ]
that's weird.

316
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,959
That was my -- that was
my nickname in the corps.

317
00:11:26,027 --> 00:11:28,862
'cause of my bad temper.

318
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,032
Anyway,
thanks for having me over

319
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,235
And having me for dinner,
letting me do my laundry.

320
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,605
This has not been
a good day.

321
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:42,709
Um, scott, I-I have a confession
to make.

That's the least of my worries.

Okay,
how does this thing work?

Yeah, I think you just
press that button right
there in the middle.

a little high, doesn't it?

Yes.

right?

Ah, burrito, bur-right-o.

I hear you, jay.
If I was home right now,

364
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:04,858
I'd be mixing up
a bathtub full of eggnog

And trying to squeeze
a greased hog into a santa hat.

Do you?

368
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,002
The point is that those are
memories that I'll always have,

369
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,371
But now I have
the perfect opportunity

To create new memories
with my new family

Cam's right.

374
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,780
We create new traditions
every year.

So...Who's ready
to try the swing?

Manny,

384
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:55,375
Jay has great memories with
his kids when they were young.

385
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,777
And he just wants
to re-create them with you.

386
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,847
So, maybe the best gift
I could give jay

387
00:14:00,915 --> 00:14:03,583
Would be christmas
like he used to have it?

388

You're such
a beautiful boy.

389

One day, you're gonna grow up
and I'm gonna miss

All the things that you used
to do as a little boy.

Okay, but if
this so-called santa claus

Doesn't bring me
a burgundy dinner jacket,

Hmm?

396
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:25,405
Would it really be so bad
to back down?

397
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,008
And have the kids never
take any of our threats
seriously again?

398
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,876
Yeah.
Mm.

<i>Or the kids could realize</i>

400

That we're making
a supreme sacrifice

401
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:41,121
By giving up our power
to save their christmas.

402
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:43,323
Which would, in a way,
be the greatest gift

403
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:44,824
That we could ever
give them.

404
00:14:44,892 --> 00:14:47,694
And which would paradoxically
make them respect us even more.

405

Mm...
Okay, forget that.

at school,

And when no one was home,
I...I tried it,

too close to the couch.

my christmas away,

But don't take it
from everyone else.

00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:47,841
Ooh! Ooh!

482
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:54,080
But -- but -- but what about --
what about forgiveness?

483
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:56,249
You were nice.
He was naughty.

484
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:03,523
Where were you
for so long?

485
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,891
Just a little
last-minute shopping.

486
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,326
What's this?

487
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:07,427
<i>Buñuelos.</i>

488
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,396
Who? What?
Cheese fritters.

489
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,431
It's a colombian traditional
christmas food.

490
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:12,866
Okay, new rule.

491
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:16,069
From now on, we do colombian
things when we're in colombia.

492
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,571
We do american things
when we're in america.

493
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,541
That means no more of your food,
no more of your music,

494
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,244
And especially no more
of your crazy holidays!

495
00:18:27,348 --> 00:18:28,748
<i>Inocente!</i>

496
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,950
Jay!
What?
Did I say it wrong?

497
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:32,685
<i>You two
are total inocentes.</i>

498
00:18:32,753 --> 00:18:34,354
You should see the look
on your faces.

499
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,823
And by the way, you know
how hard it is to get fireworks

500
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:38,324
On christmas eve?

501
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:40,860
[ laughs ] go, manny.

502

Thank you.
[ laughs ]

503
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:47,370
And here's another one for luke. 
looks like a book.

504
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,472
I have a book already.

505
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,707
What is that?

506
00:18:50,775 --> 00:18:53,076
Oh, my god.
The couch is smoking.

507
00:18:53,144 --> 00:18:55,478
Whoa.
Whoa.
Whoa-ho-ho.

508
00:18:58,215 --> 00:18:59,516
It's sunlight.

509
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,418
It's the ornament.

510
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:02,585
Luke: Cool.

511
00:19:02,653 --> 00:19:03,853
It's like
a magnifying glass.

512
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:06,322
Hey, how weird is that?

513
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,324
It's burning a hole
in the exact same spot

514
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:10,060
That alex was smoking in.

515
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,761
Oh, haley.

516
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:14,197
Alex, why'd you take
the blame?

517
00:19:14,265 --> 00:19:17,067
I didn't want
to lose christmas.

518
00:19:17,134 --> 00:19:20,103
That is
so stinking beautul.

519
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:22,405
Get in here.

520
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,373
No.
Yes.

521
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:24,674
Oh, no.
Yes.In here.

522
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:25,909
Oh, yeah!

523
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:26,910
Bear hug!

524
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:29,179
[ laughter ]

525
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:31,214
You were going
to take christmas away

526
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:32,816
For something
that none of us did.

527
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,284
Well, um...

528
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:37,220
Christmas is about
moving forward.

529
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:38,588
I've never heard that.

530
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:40,090
Actually, honey, you did kind of
shoot your mouth off.

531
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:41,691
You called us
all liars.

532
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,793
Yeah, and then you took away
the biggest holiday...

533
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:45,161
Yeah, you did.
I don't know.

534
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:47,263
Let's -- let's not all get
worked up.

535
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,532
I made a mistake.

536
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,867
I made a mistake.

537
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:54,104
And people make mistakes.

538
00:19:54,171 --> 00:19:58,374
And they make up
for those mistakes...

539
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,742
Mm-hmm.

540
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,581
...By taking their family
to Italy!

541
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:05,949
Haley: Oh, my god!

542
00:20:06,016 --> 00:20:06,950
Yeah!

543
00:20:07,017 --> 00:20:09,652
Yeah!

544
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,387
Yeah!
Aah!

545
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:19,596
Jay: We talk a lot about
tradition this time of year.

546
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,232
But as much as we love
our traditions,

547
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:23,666
Sometimes our best memories

548
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:27,537
Come from the times
that are the most untraditional.

549
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:35,078
We remember the year mom and dad
went crazy.

550
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:39,415
We remember the year santa
punched out the caroler.

551
00:20:41,485 --> 00:20:46,256
But for me, this was the year
that the word "tradition"

552
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:48,024
Got a lot bigger.

553
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:59,769
