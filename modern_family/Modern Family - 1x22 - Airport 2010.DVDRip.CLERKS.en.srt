00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,594
[Loud Clapping]
What the hell are you doing?

148
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,346
Oh, I'm just trying
to keep her awake so
she'll sleep on the plane.

149
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,850
Nobody likes
a crying baby on a flight.
It's-It's very stressful.

150
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,102
Uh, last year I flew back
from New York...

151
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,064
next to a baby who was
very upset the entire flight,
and it was hell.

152
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,609
I was on that flight with you,
and I don't recall-

153
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:25,153
Oh, I get it.
You're talking about me.
That's very funny.

154
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,322
Yeah, we couldn't get tickets
to Billy Elliot.

155
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,366
[Voice Breaking]
All he wanted to do was dance,
and that's my story.

156
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,995
Five hours of this.
[English Accent] I just
want to dance at the ballet!

157
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,628
Dramamine.
Oh, I wish I had that
the last time I flew.

158
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,589
Tell you, the plane
was rocking up and down,
back and forth.

159
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,133
I thought the wings
were gonna snap off, honestly.

160
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,218
Okay, you do it yourself.
Use your teeth.

161
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,349
I-Is this the best way to go?
What about the freeway?

162
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,476
Relax, punkin.
I got this.

163
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,811
It's all about
knowing the route.

164
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,231
You're talking to a guy who
made his way through college
by driving a pedicab.

165
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,317
You know what
one of those is?
Yes. Yes.

166
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,111
I just saw one pass us.
[Cell Phone Ringing]

167
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,946
Quick-
Who sang "Evil Woman"?
What?

168
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,866
ELO!
[Claire] Phil,
where the hell are you?

169
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,620
Uh, let's see. Oh, shoot!
I just missed my turn.

170
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,330
You're supposed to
be here with me.

171
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,333
I told you,
I get more and more freaked out
as we get closer to the flight.

172
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,168
Well, I know,
but Mitch-
Okay, you know what?

173
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:26,506
I was counting
on you to be here,
so thanks a lot.

174
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,257
[Beeps]

175
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,721
She's pretty tightly wound.

176
00:08:33,806 --> 00:08:35,723
Some people are
just built that way.

177
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,518
[Shouting]
Honestly, could you
drive any slower?

178
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:41,729
Guess where
the world's largest
wind generator is.

179
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:44,023
Is it right behind me?

180
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,150
Nope. It's on the island of Oahu.

181
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm thinking about using it
in my song about Hawaii.
What song?

182
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,739
Didn't Mom tell you?
Surprise!

183
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:55,034
The whole family's
putting on a show for you
for your birthday.

184
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,329
Everybody's performing.
Even Phil brought his dummy.

185
00:08:58,414 --> 00:09:00,748
Isn't that great?
[Chuckling]

186
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,792
Jay?
Oh, I'm sorry.

187
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,795
I was just thinking
how tragic it would be
if I fell into that volcano.

188
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,380
Ay, papi, don't say that.

189
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,049
Ow, ow, ow.

190
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:12,969
Not yet, sweetie.
Not yet.

191
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,098
See? He's perfect.

192
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:20,435
Look at him getting coffee
and not putting chocolate in it.
He's so mature.

193
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,186
[Alex]
What about Dylan?

194
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,605
Dylan's no that guy.

195
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,023
[Knocking]

196
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:27,150
Haley! Come on!

197
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,152
We're leaving in two minutes!
Get up!

198
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,236
[Door Slams]

199
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,407
Oh, my God!
Oh, no.
Is it tomorrow?

200
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,576
Dylan!
What are you doing here?

201
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,411
I was gonna go,
but then you fell asleep,

202
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,789
and since you're leaving
for a week, I want to stare
at you as long as I could.

203
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,208
You have to go.
My parents are gonna
think we did it.

204
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,627
[Scoffs]
As if.

205
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,589
Get out of the house
and make sure that
nobody sees you.

206
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,591
I'II miss you.

207
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:55,094
When you're gone, it's like
I'm this prisoner trapped
in a cell of loneliness.

208
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,305
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's beautiful, but you have to go.

209
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,890
Okay.

210
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,940
[Claire]
I hate this feeling.
I hate it.

211
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,526
And it's just gonna get worse
and worse until the flight.

212
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,987
Hey! It's gonna be fine.

213
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,157
Uncle Phil's here.

214
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,118
Great job, buddy!
First one ready.
[Luke] Thanks.

215
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,245
Haley and Alex, let's go!
[Alex]
Coming.

216
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,955
[Sneezes]
Bless you.

217
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,249
[Alex]
Coming.
All right. Come on, girls.

218
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,751
[Beeping]
Okay.

219
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,253
This is why we practice.
Come on through.
Come through.

220
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,714
Fifteen seconds.
Are we ready?
[Alex, Luke] Yes.

221
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,800
It's go time.
[Rapid Beeping]

222
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,177
Straight to the car.
Slow is smooth,
and smooth is fast.

223
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,679
Slow is smooth,
and smooth is fast.
Straight through.

224
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,766
[Phil] Very nice!
[Claire] All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

225
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,726
Hey! I think we got
an extra couple of seconds.

226
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,354
No, we don't.
[Alex]
Dad, come on!

[Sustained Tone]

229
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,289
- Oh, no!
- What?

230
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,958
My keys!

231
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,712
Stay awake, sweetie.
Stay awake.

232
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,757
Whee! Oh, no.

233
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,593
This is where your Realtor
training comes in handy.

234
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,222
Looks like
a standard Porter and Sons
D-Model top lock.

235

[Clears Throat]
One quick swipe oughta pop it.

236
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,144
All aboard.

237
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,355
Okay.
There we go.

238
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,357
Nice and easy.
Whoa.

239
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,068
Yeah, you're pinching.
You're pinching.
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,864
If you show enough houses,
you learn all the tricks.

241
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,158
Every Realtor is just
a ninja in a blazer.

242
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,620
The average burglar breaks in
and leaves clues everywhere,

243
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,622
but not me.

244
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,458
I'm completely clueless.

245
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,544
You're sure
I'm not too heavy?

246
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,046
Please, you weigh less
than my paintball gear.

247
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,799
Okay. Yup.
There we go. We are in.

248
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,093
Off-load. On we go.
Squeezing.

249
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,470
I'm going for a ride.
You all right?

250
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,472
Yup. I'm good. I'm good.

251
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:08,394
What are you doing?
Just making it a little
tougher on the next guy.

252
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,730
You got to get up
pretty early- Son of a-

253
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,899
Are you all right?
Yes, I am.

254
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:15,109
Just, uh, almost killed myself
on your fire truck.

255
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,570
That's not ours.
That's Jasper's.
You know Jasper?

256
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,531
I sold a house to his parents.
How did you ever get
a playdate with him?

257
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:23,159
Let's go!
Please, can- yeah.
Okay.

258
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,787
[Haley]
Look at him.
He's sketching.

259
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,832
He's like Leonardo DiCaprio
in Titanic.

260
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,876
I bet he goes
to art school.

261
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,170
Do you think
he's sketching us?

262
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,757
Yeah. "Us."

263
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,635
[Woman On P.A.] Check-in
for the 5:30 flight to Boston
may board at this time.

264
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,720
And contact.

265

[Cell Phone Ringing]

266
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,101
Ugh! It's Dylan.

267
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:52,521
"I'm trapped."
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What a drama queen.

268
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,072
We will go whale washing,
explore the tropical forest,
get back into the nature.

269
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,157
[Manny]
That sounds fun.
Mm-hmm.

270
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,284
Thanks.
Thank you.

271
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,286
[Woman On P.A.]
Your attention, please.

272
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,997
Will Manny Delgado
please report to Gate 22-A?

273
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:13,501
Manny Delgado to Gate 22-A.

274
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:17,630
Check it out, Grandpa.
The Dramamine's working.
I'm not dizzy.

275
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,341
Yeah. Oh, watch
the drink, kid.

276
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,968
[Crunch]
Ooh! Ooh, my Ludlums!

277
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:26,389
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
All right. Relax, relax.
We might be okay here.

278
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:33,354
It's not fair.
It's not fair.

279
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,442
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is this Manny Delgado?

280
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,486
- Yes.
- Your son's name
is on a no-fly list.

281
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,281
Ay, please, we've been
through this at the check-in.
He's not the same Manny Delgado.

282
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,659
I'm just a boy trying
to bring style back to travel.

283
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,995
- We just have
a few questions to ask.
- No, this is a mistake.

284
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:51,414
Where is my husband?
Wait. Jay!
Step this way, ma'am.

285
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,084
Ma'am, step this way, please.
Son, step this way.
Jay! No pushing. Jay!

286
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,923
You make it a double?
I'm traveling with my family.

287
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,800
No problem.

288
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,266
Must be a lot easier
just living with a guy.

289
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,518
Yeah, life would be simpler
if I was gay.

290
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,645
Do you think you could
get in the fast lane?

291
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:18,024
Oh, I could totally
get in the fast lane.
I mean the road.

292
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,651
[Phone Beeping]
Oh, I'm getting a text.
What does it say?

293
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,320
Um- Oh, G- Well, it's nothing.
It's the alarm company.

294
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,698
It says your house
was broken into.
What?

295
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:28,784
It's nothing. They'll
take care of it. Just drive!
What happened?

296
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,454
[Alarm Blaring]

297
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,043
Okay, fun airport game.
Mm-hmm.

298
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,503
You pick out a traveler,
you come up with
their entire story.

299
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,547
Okay. This guy,
his name's Henry.

300
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,675
He's on his way to Phoenix
to visit his grandmother,
whose name is, uh-

301
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,677
Oh! Pass.

302
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,679
- Too hard. Your turn.
- Okay. Fine.

303
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,849
I see a woman, uh, wracked
with fear, whose husband
has abandoned her.

304
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,060
- Where? Where? Who is she?
- Me.

305
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,437
I made it perfectly clear to
Phil that I needed him here.

306
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,981
Oh. It's going around.
Mitchell's mad at me too.

307
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,942
He thinks because I didn't
help him pack this morning,
he forgot his wallet.

308
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,278
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to be snippy.

309
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,073
It's just...
I'm a little upset with Cam.

310
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,785
I needed his help this morning,
and he let me down.

311
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:14,205
That doesn't sound like him.
You asked him to do something
and he didn't do it?

312
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,333
But he never asked!
I mean, all he said was,

313
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:20,419
"Lily's bag needs to be packed
and the newspaper
needs to be canceled."

314
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,588
That sounds to me
like he was asking for help.

315
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,883
Sounds to me
like you expected him
to read your mind.

316
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,719
- What am I, a psychic?
- No! It's not about reading minds.

317
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,930
It's about knowing
what your partner needs.

318
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,516
Here's an idea:
Just say "help me."

319
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,601
You don't even have to
say "me," just "help."

320
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,312
Then he'll know exactly
what you want. You won't
have to get all mad.

321
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,065
I'm not mad. It's just-

322
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:45,486
You wanna believe you're on
the same wavelength as someone,
and then it's just-

323
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,905
it's a little disheartening
when you find out you're not.

324
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,199
That's all.

325
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:53,035
What's frustrating
is I would do anything
for Mitchell,

326
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,080
and-and frankly, it's a little hurtful
that he doesn't know that.

327
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,169
So, airports, huh?

328
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:04,547
Yeah.

329
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:08,592
Are you drawing
something there?
Yeah. It's no good.

Tortured artist.
Classic.

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,889
Oh, yeah.

332
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,185
It's a robot.
Oh, yeah. Sure is.

333
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,396
What's behind him?
A dinosaur.

334
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,482
It's for school.
We're supposed to make
a comic strip.

335

back in the eighth-

What you drinking?

344
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:57,808
Dad. Hey. Mostly tonic actually,
thanks to my new sponsor here.

345
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:01,145
Mmm. I'm a little jittery about flying.

346
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,480
What are you talking about?
You fly all the time.

347
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,358
Yeah, I know. This started
just in the last couple years.

348
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:10,279
I think I'm just-
I'm nervous 'cause I've got
so much to lose now, you know?

349
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:13,032
What about you?
I'm taking a break
from my vacation.

350
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,075
We haven't even started yet.

351
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,828
Well, I gotta figure,
I might not have a lot
of time for myself,

352
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:20,164
you know, what with the luaus,
the hiking, the talent shows.

353
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,374
Are you not happy
that we're coming with you?

354
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,002
It's just not
what I expected.

355
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,588
But, Dad, doesn't it
feel good to know...

356
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,759
that your whole family
is willing to drop everything
to be with you,

357
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:34,845
to fly across the ocean
in a steel coffin?

358
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,388
I'm gonna finish that.

359
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,474
It's not you guys.
I love the family.

Mm-hmm.

00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,020
It just kinda feels like Gloria's
going out of her way...

362
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,105
not to spend time with me.

363
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,151
You don't believe that, do you?

00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:53,822
Oh, come on, Dad!
That is so crazy and so adorable.

I wasn't lovable.

that would spend the money
to fly a family to Hawaii.

money comes from?

did you have in Japan?
I've never been to Japan.

November 2003 to attend
an electronics trade show?

Enough. Why don't you
question the other people
on the gate, huh?

Did you see the old lady
with the cane?

375

What if she has a ceramic knife
in there that can go through
the metal detector?

And yet you waste your time
harassing a little kid.

an awful lot about sneaking

I am so sorry.
It was my fault.

It wasn't your fault.
I should have known
what you wanted.

Are you drunk?
Kinda.

And once I spent
a week in Cancún,

392
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,527

did not live up to the hype.

are traveling together?
- Yes.

on different dates?

Well, because he's traveling
back home with his family.

it's only you and me.
Really?

Mm-hmm. I wanted to spend
some time alone with my husband-
