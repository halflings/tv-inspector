1
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:03,573
<i>What are you doing with those?</i>

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:05,274
Luke and I are doing a recycling drive.

3
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:06,642
If we collect enough bottles,

4
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:08,005
They build a school in africa.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,232
Wouldn't that be so cool

6
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,669
To go to a school made out of bottles?

7
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:14,601
That would certainly
be a special school.

8
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:16,038
Did you hear what I said, parents --

9
00:00:16,072 --> 00:00:17,937
<i>"special school"?</i>

10
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,939
Okay. Nobody make a big deal about it,

11
00:00:19,973 --> 00:00:21,172
But I just broke up with dylan.

12
00:00:21,206 --> 00:00:22,272
No!

13
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:23,840
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay, honey?

14
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,043
Yeah, I'm fine.

15
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:27,351
I just -- I need to date
someone who has a clue,

16
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,523
Instead of an idiot who bangs his head

17
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:32,093
Every time he rides his
bike out of his garage.

18
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,097
<i>Every time.</i>

19
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,869
I'm sorry, honey.

20
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:37,874
I'm sorry for both of you.

21
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:39,544
I'll have to text him later.

22
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:41,714
Mm. I got to jump in the shower.
I'm gonna be late.

23
00:00:41,748 --> 00:00:44,022
Where are you going?
I'm going to meet my friend valerie.

24
00:00:44,056 --> 00:00:45,324
I haven't seen her in 15 years.

25
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:46,325
We used to work together.

26
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,760
<i>You worked? Mm-hmm.</i>

27
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,397
I can't imagine you working.

28
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:50,933
Luke, let me tell you something.

29
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,436
That is very offensive to women.

30
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,205
Your mom works very hard --

31
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,207
Just now, she works for us.

32
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,775
I will have you know

33
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,980
That I had quite the
little career going.

34
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:02,750
I was an account manager
at starcrest hotels.

35
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:03,952
I had a little cubicle,

36
00:01:03,986 --> 00:01:06,023
And I -- and I wore my
tennis shoes to work

37
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:07,558
And changed into my work pumps.

38
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:09,093
It was very "working girl."

39
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:11,096
That's movie's so cl. Mm-hmm.

40
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,066
I don't mind saying,
I was making quite a splash.

41
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,534
Well, then, why'd you quit?

42
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:16,804
Well, haley, call me old-fashioned,

43
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,774
But I wanted to focus
on raising a family,

44
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:20,776
So...I married your dad.

45
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,511
And five months later, we...

46
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:24,681
Were...Four months away

47
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:26,683
From having this little bundle of joy.

48
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:28,251
Mm-hmm.

49
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,422
there's my lawyer!

50
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:34,558
Gloria got into a little car accident,

51
00:01:34,592 --> 00:01:36,259
So my dad asked me to help her out.

52
00:01:36,294 --> 00:01:37,760
And, uh, this is the first time

53
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:39,829
That my dad's asked me for legal advice,

54
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:41,464
And it's -- it's nice.

55
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,067
It's nice to know that
that he respects me in that way.

56
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,336
Well, mitchell is an amazing lawyer.

57
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,072
My dream for him is that one day

58
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:50,374
He'll be on the supreme court.

59
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:52,010
Why, cam?

60
00:01:52,044 --> 00:01:53,812
So at parties, I can tell everyone

61
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:55,914
My partner is one of the supremes.

62
00:01:57,418 --> 00:01:58,819
There he is!

63
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,620
The steely, grizzled veteran

64
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:02,690
Ready to do battle with
the plucky upstart.

65
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:05,259
Speed versus grace.
Brute force versus --

66
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,694
Let's just do this.

67
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:08,096
Jay and I are both gym rats.

68
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,764
I love the sauna
that's the dry heat --

69
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,499
And the steam -- wet.

70
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,735
And, of course, I am just
a kook for racquetball --

71
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,537
Club champ two years in a row,

72
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,906
Tonganoxie, missouri, rec center.

73
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,409
So, naturally, jay and I
have been trying for months

74
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,979
To get together to bang the
old hollow rubber ball around.

75
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,684
I have been avoiding
this day like the plague.

76
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,222
I mean, part of going to the gym
is the locker-room atmosphere.

77
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:34,958
And if I'm there with a gay guy,

78
00:02:34,992 --> 00:02:37,060
It's just not gonna be the same.

79
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:39,329
I mean, for me, it's a locker room.

80
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:40,865
For him, it's a showroom.

81
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,668
She doesn't get it.

82
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:53,638
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

83
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:02,523
* I'll let you see my scar *

84
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,225
What the hell?

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,668
Some people call me a salesman.

86
00:03:11,702 --> 00:03:13,403
I call myself a "salesfriend."

87
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,372
So, obviously,
I need strangers to trust me.

88
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:16,506
I don't take kindly to it

89
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,342
When someone tom sellecks my bus bench.

90
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:19,410
Phil dunphy.

91
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,544
Phil, it's barbara.

92
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,113
The pattersons want
to back ouof the deal.

93
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:23,582
Why?! What happened?!

94
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,251
The wife's getting cold feet.
I told her to call you.

95
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:28,687
Okay. Fine. I'll handle it.

96
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,023
I'm not losing this sale!

97
00:03:31,058 --> 00:03:33,025
By the way -- I've spent
way too much time on it.

98
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,961
Um, phil, do you take
elm when you come to --

99
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,162
I saw it, barbara.

100
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:47,040
It's a terrific gym, jay.
Very liberal with the towels.

101
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,141
<i>I love that.</i>

102
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,043
Showers are private,
in case you're wondering.

103
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,813
I wasn't, but thanks for the heads-up.

104
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:55,081
Now, that's a surprise -- boxers.

105
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:56,416
Is that necessary?

106
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,185
Well, I just always pictured
you as a tighty-whitey guy

107
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,987
Well, do me a favor
the next time you picture me,

108
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,088
Leave the underwear out of it.

109
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:03,123
Well, don't you worry.

110
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,591
The only thing I'm picturing

111
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,059
Is how clean the floor is gonna be

112
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:07,894
When I'm done mopping it with you.

113
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:09,263
Is that the best you can do?

114
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:10,898
'cause it's gonna take a little more

115
00:04:10,932 --> 00:04:13,000
Than some lame trash talk
to get me out of my --

116
00:04:13,034 --> 00:04:14,802
Gah! What the hell was that?!

117
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:16,570
Our butts pressed against each other.

118
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:17,705
They didn't press. It was glancing.

119
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,074
Stop talking about it!

120
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,009
Oh, come on. All the time
you've spent in the locker room,

121
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,343
This can't be your first moon landing.

122
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,145
You got a name for it? It's very common.

123
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,447
You got off easy. At least it
didn't happen after a shower.

124
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:28,382
Enough. We call that a splashdown.

125
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,350
That's it. I'm changing in the stall.

126
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:31,318
Excuse me!

127
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:36,579
You had your arm around her
with that humpy look you get!

128
00:04:37,214 --> 00:04:38,948
No, that's not always how you look!

129
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:40,316
We're over!

130
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:42,718
So, I'd really like to talk to you,
mrs. Patterson,

131
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:44,520
And see if we can't
turn this thing around.

132
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,856
Uh, you've got my number. Thank you.

133
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,825
<i>I said we are over.</i>

134
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:51,127
Why don't you go out
for a nice bike ride?!

135
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,728
Dylan again, huh?

136
00:04:52,763 --> 00:04:56,498
<i>Some guys just do not know how to play
it.</i>

137
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:57,633
Dad, what are you doing?

138
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,801
Oh, right.

139
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,736
Just, uh, tes
t-driving my new soup strainer.

140
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,303
I dug it out of the Halloween stuff

141
00:05:02,338 --> 00:05:03,471
To see what people think.

142
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:11,011
Do people want their real-estate advice

143
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:13,881
From someone who leads or
from someone who follows?

144
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,717
I'm betting these babies are
coming back in a big way.

145
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,184
Buy low, sell high.

146
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:21,654
People are gonna see this and say,
"that guy's high."

147
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,590
Sorry to bother you, sir.

148
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,058
We're doing work next
door and nicked a main,

149
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,726
So we're gonna have to
shut down your water.

150
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,428
Oh, okay. No problem.

151
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:30,896
Yeah, it shouldn't be too long.

152
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,397
And if you happen to need it,
there's a port-a-potty out front.

153
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:33,498
Thanks. Yeah.

154
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,099
Hey. Nice mustache.

155
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,301
yeah, man.

156
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,170
You too, brother.

157
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:42,040
"you too, brother."

158
00:05:45,977 --> 00:05:48,212
Haley -- she's the oldest, 15.

159
00:05:48,246 --> 00:05:51,381
And then alex is 13.
And that's my baby, luke.

160
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,383
He's 11. Can you believe it?

161
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,220
Oh, my god. They're gorgeous. Yeah.

162
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,988
And things are still good
with "phil the thrill?"

163
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:00,258
Yes. Things are great -- great with him.

164
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,793
I'm so happy for you. Really.

165
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,195
I'm so -- I'm so happy
that you're happy.

166
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,563
thank you.

167
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,699
Well, and you, too.
I mean, your life is --

168
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,268
No, no, no, no, no.
Let's talk about you. Okay

169
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,903
Because, you know, you're --

170
00:06:11,937 --> 00:06:14,372
You chose the...Mother.

171
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:18,043
You're the mommy, the yomm
y-mommy-mama person. Uh-huh.

172
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,346
Kind of squeezing the
ring right into my finger.

173
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:23,549
Was I? A little.

174
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,984
I'm so sorry.

175
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,820
And just then, it hit me.
She was jealous of me.

176
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,355
Yes, there had always been

177
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,924
A little bit of a
competition between us.

178
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,426
This was more serious.

179
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,528
She was looking at my life

180
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,230
As something that she'd always wanted...

181
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,565
But never had.

182
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,066
So, how's life in the trenches?

183
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,968
You know, you still got the
bastards on the 23rd floor

184
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,069
Making life miserable

185
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,704
For all the people
actually doing the work.

186
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,639
Same as ever, right?

187
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,274
One -- one difference. Mm-hmm.

188
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,009
I'm one of them bastards now.

189
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,710
Wait, you're on the 23rd floor?

190
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,979
<i>Well, I'm on the 24th floor.</i>

191
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,047
Wow, that's insane.

192
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,949
It's -- it's no big deal.

193
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,917
I mean, if you hadn't left,

194
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:00,586
It probably would have been you.

195
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,459
I was driving along this street.

196
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,961
The cars were parked just like this,

197
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:11,731
And -- boom! -- Out of nowhere,
he hits me.

198
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,199
Okay, so, he -- he cut you off.

199
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,501
Yes. Right.

200
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,969
A crazy driver.

201
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,804
You know, I used to be
a little bit like that.

202
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,572
I don't know,
maybe it's because of lily,

203
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,275
But I've definitely
become more considerate.

204
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:24,978
Like, I used to never let
people in, and now I do.

205
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,314
I'm just now getting that metaphor.

206
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:28,348
Okay.

207
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:29,716
So, what do you think?

208
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,952
Were there any witnesses? No,
just manny.

209
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:33,086
He was in the back seat.

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,221
It all happened so fast,
just like they say.

211
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,690
Yeah.

212
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,291
All right, well,
this is what we're gonna do.

213
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,193
I'll take a few pictures, and then
we'll sit down and write a statement.

214
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,361
Perfect.

215
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,029
I'll go and get us a table. All right.

216
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,264
Manny, come.

217
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,932
Uh, just a minute, mom.
I need to tie my shoe.

218
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,200
Okay.

219
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,601
Mitchell. Yeah?

220
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,802
Don't talk. Listen.

221
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,037
<i>It was her fault.</i>

222
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,371
I'm -- I'm sorry, what?

223
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:54,907
Don't look at me.
Do something. Take pictures.

224
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,743
Manny!

225
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,845
What kind of cupcake do you want?

226
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,515
Uh, that's okay! I'm not hungry!

227
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:04,351
That was a mistake.
Now she'll know something's up.

228
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,385
Are you okay?!

229
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,354
I'm fine!

230
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:09,823
She cut that guy off.
She's a terrible driver.

231
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,459
She's a danger to us all.

232
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:12,693
Okay. Wait. Now stop.

233
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:14,362
I-I thought she said he was parked

234
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:15,529
And then he cut her off.

235
00:08:15,564 --> 00:08:16,764
Everybody looks parked

236
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:17,965
When you're going 100 miles an hr!

237
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,401
Manny, why didn't you speak up?

238
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:22,636
She can't take criticism
about her driving.

239
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:24,839
Once, an old lady yelled
at her at a crosswalk.

240
00:08:24,873 --> 00:08:26,941
She honked so long the horn ran out.

241
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,843
Manny!

242
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:31,646
I've said too much already.

243
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,151
Are you hearing this?

244
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:40,889
Aah...

245
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:42,190
Point.

246
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:44,759
Hinder!

247
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:47,028
Aah! Boom!

248
00:08:47,063 --> 00:08:48,396
Lucky shot!

249
00:08:48,431 --> 00:08:49,564
That is game!

250
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,999
And, believe, match.

251
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:52,367
Yep. Fine. You won.

252
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:53,969
But, you know, what do you expect?

253
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:55,437
For the first half of the game,

254
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,740
I was distracted by what
happened in the locker room.

255
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,208
And you're sure it's not because

256
00:08:59,242 --> 00:09:00,742
I'm a fabulous racquetball player?

257
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:02,511
You're average,
but I was a little thrown

258
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:04,180
By you touching me, which is unnatural.

259
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:05,715
Not to you, of course.

260
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:06,882
No, to you, it's like rocket fuel.

261
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:08,284
Oh, sure. When you're gay,

262
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:10,720
You just walk around giving
butt bumps to everybody.

263
00:09:10,754 --> 00:09:12,622
It's like a high-five. It a low-two.

264
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,524
You know what?
I'm gonna prove that you won

265
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:16,260
Only because I was distracted.

266
00:09:16,294 --> 00:09:18,629
We're gonna have a rematch
right here, right now.

267
00:09:18,663 --> 00:09:20,130
Do you want to go up
against me again? Yes.

268
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,632
No! Damn it!

269
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,035
Hello! Hey, dad.

270
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,972
Uh, did you know that the
accident was gloria's fault? Yes.

271
00:09:28,006 --> 00:09:29,073
I mean, I wasn't there,

272
00:09:29,107 --> 00:09:30,274
But she's a horrible driver.

273
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,776
If she hit 10 cars,
I wouldn't be surprised.

274
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:32,777
If you knew that it was her fault,

275
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:33,945
Why did you get me involved?

276
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:35,279
Because someone has to tell her

277
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:36,981
She's in the wrong,
and better you than me.

278
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,482
That's great. I --

279
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,517
Here I am thinking that my dad
actually respects me as lawyer,

280
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,186
And, really, you're just
throwing me to the wolves.

281
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,821
Can't it be both?

282
00:09:43,856 --> 00:09:45,289
Okay, dad, it doesn't
it doesn't bother you in the least

283
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:47,225
That your gay son's the
only one tough enough

284
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:48,326
To stand up to your wife?

285
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,061
Go get 'em, rocky. See you later.

286
00:09:50,095 --> 00:09:52,096
Your father and I had a moon
landing in the locker room!

287
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,664
What's the matter with you?

288
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:55,032
What about you?

289
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,500
I mean, did you ever get
serious with anyone?

290
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:57,501
Thank you.

291
00:09:57,535 --> 00:09:59,369
Oh, no. Not yet.

292
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,638
Ohh. Honey, you will.

293
00:10:01,672 --> 00:10:04,140
Oh, no. I hope not. It's -- it's fun.

294
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,375
I'm sorry. I'm just
I'm waiting for some news.

295
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,510
What news?

296
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,812
I'm -- I'm up for the paris job.

297
00:10:09,847 --> 00:10:12,581
The -- the head of the
international division?!

298
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,450
That's -- that's -- that's crazy.

299
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:15,851
Yeah, no, I mean, I'll never get it,

300
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:17,019
But it'd be great, 'cause --

301
00:10:17,054 --> 00:10:18,654
Well, 'cause one of my
lovers lives in paris.

302
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:20,089
Oh.

303
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:22,258
I-I don't know what jumps
out of that sentence more,

304
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,460
You know, "lovers" or "one of."

305
00:10:24,494 --> 00:10:27,330
Well, I'm single.
I mean, it's kind of what you do.

306
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,032
Uh-huh. I have one in paris.

307
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,233
Oh.

308
00:10:30,268 --> 00:10:33,804
Um, I have paris, new york, miami...

309
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,572
I have a fourth one.

310
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:38,475
I'm forgetting my lover.
I'm forgetting my lover.

311
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,511
Last night, I vacuumed
the radiator thingy

312
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,746
Under the fridge, you know,

313
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,714
That collects the dust,
'cause you should,

314
00:10:43,749 --> 00:10:45,183
And I don't, so...

315
00:10:45,217 --> 00:10:47,118
oh, hey. Hold on.

316
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:48,220
Cross your fingers.

317
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:50,356
I'm not gonna lie.

318
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,691
The thought of valerie getting
the one job in the whole company

319
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:55,760
<i>That everyone coveted -- well,
I wasn't a lover of that.</i>

320
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:57,929
Okay. Okay, thank you.

321
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,032
Well?

322
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,633
Oh, they haven't made a decision.

323
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,568
They're -- they're
gonna tell me later on.

324
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:06,570
That's not what they said, is it?

325
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:08,239
Oh, yeah. It is. It is.

326
00:11:08,273 --> 00:11:09,907
Oh, valerie, come on. It's me.

327
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,442
What are friends for

328
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,044
If not to be there for you
when you get bad news?

329
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:14,679
I got it! Oh, my god!

330
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,214
aah!

331
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,448
I'm the head of europe!

332
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,150
Well, you know, for the hotel,

333
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:20,451
Not the continent,

334
00:11:20,486 --> 00:11:21,486
But...Yay!

335
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,987
Kind of, though. Kind of.

336
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:25,590
Why didn't you tell me when you
when you first heard?

337
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:27,825
Ohh...

338
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,360
'cause, you know.

339
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:31,763
<i>And that's when it really hit me.</i>

340
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,599
Valerie wasn't jealous of me.
She pitied me.

341
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,135
And part of me wanted to
take her back to the house

342
00:11:37,169 --> 00:11:39,537
And show her everything she was missing

343
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:42,974
In her sad, childless, husbandless life.

344
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:48,146
But there's a little thing called "
taking the high road."

345
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,614
Why don't you come by
and meet everybody?

346
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:51,549
Oh, sure. Yeah, no, that'd be great.

347
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,384
Yeah, I mean, alex is just a genius,

348
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,786
And haley is turning into
this beautiful young woman.

349
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,255
And it makes me realize that motherhood

350
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:00,090
Is probably the most important
san francisco.

351
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,091
That was my fourth lover.

352
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,259
San francisco. "fourth lover."

353
00:12:02,293 --> 00:12:03,460
It would have kept me up all night.

354
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:04,594
Yeah.

355
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:08,198
Dad, look.

356
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,432
Just a sec, buddy. I'm on my way
out to the bathroom. Check it out.

357
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,434
The aubreys had this
huge party last night,

358
00:12:12,469 --> 00:12:14,303
And we got all these bottles to recycle.

359
00:12:14,337 --> 00:12:15,304
Great!

360
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:16,905
What's jagermeister?

361
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,407
Um...

362
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:21,276
Well, you know how in a fairy tale

363
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,411
There's alwa a potion

364
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:24,180
That makes the princess fall asleep

365
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:26,015
And then the guys start kissing her?

366
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,316
Well, this is like that,

367
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,918
Except you don't wake up in a castle.

368
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:32,154
You wake up in a frat house
with a bad reputation.

369
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:50,441
Haley!

370
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,150
Luke, you're spilling it!

371
00:12:58,184 --> 00:12:58,984
Aw, crud!

372
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,118
God!

373
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,154
Aah! Gross! A rat!

374
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:03,421
cool.

375
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,525
Hang on, I'm coming!

376
00:13:09,762 --> 00:13:12,297
I believe you have something
that belongs to me --

377
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,832
My heart.

378
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,700
I thought I I.M.'d you to stay away.

379
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:17,869
Ow!

380
00:13:17,903 --> 00:13:19,070
Haley!

381
00:13:22,574 --> 00:13:24,542
Hello?

382
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:25,977
Dylan?

383
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:26,978
D-money?

384
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,046
Hey, buddy?

385
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,547
Hey, buddy?!

386
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:32,383
Hello, friendly neighbors!

387
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,652
Little help?

388
00:13:34,686 --> 00:13:35,853
But I love you!

389
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:37,355
Well, you should have thought about that

390
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,324
Before you took that
skank sharon nicolini

391
00:13:39,358 --> 00:13:40,826
To an anne hathaway movie!

392
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,427
I didn't take her. She was just there.

393
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:44,629
So you were just there by yourself

394
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:46,131
At ananne h!

395
00:13:46,165 --> 00:13:47,633
I don't think so!

396
00:13:47,667 --> 00:13:50,169
Yeah! Yeah. I like her movies.

397
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:51,570
She's everywoman!

398
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,139
Come on. Let's not fight.

399
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:56,709
Let's just discuss this like two u
n-immature adults.

400
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:57,877
Ugh!

401
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,882
oh. Oh.

402
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:04,050
Hello? Mrs. Patterson.

403
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,053
Hi. I've been waiting for your call.

404
00:14:06,087 --> 00:14:07,221
Yeah.

405
00:14:07,255 --> 00:14:08,289
Um, is there any chance

406
00:14:08,357 --> 00:14:09,657
That maybe we could talk a little bit --

407
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,192
No, no. Now's perfect. That's fine.

408
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,860
I-I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

409
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,329
Let me just... Close my office door.

410
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:17,832
there we go. Much, much better.

411
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,046
Put the ducks on a row.

412
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:25,648
You're such a good lawyer.

413
00:14:25,682 --> 00:14:27,150
Uh, yeah, I just want to make sure

414
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:29,286
We're 100% clear on
exactly what happened.

415
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,488
Oh, we're clear. I told you.

416
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:34,691
What? You don't believe me?

417
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:36,760
No! No! I just --

418
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,262
You know, sometimes.

419
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:43,366
Like, is it possible, maybe,
you were driving too fast?

420
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,801
Who said I was driving fast?

421
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:45,869
Yeah. Who?

422
00:14:45,903 --> 00:14:47,737
I just -- I'm lookinat the street,

423
00:14:47,772 --> 00:14:50,240
And I'm thinking if you
were driving a little fast,

424
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:52,342
It's possible that maybe
you didn't see the car --

425
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:54,578
You're like everyone else, huh?

426
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:56,346
You blame the latino driver.

427
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:59,450
Where I come from, they always
blame the latino driver.

428
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:01,819
Where you come from,
isn't everybody a latino driver?

429
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,187
Manny, tell him.

430
00:15:03,221 --> 00:15:05,322
I can't 'cause I have
cupcake in my mouth.

431
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:07,057
Oh, come on! Don't blame your cupcake!

432
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:09,459
What? You think I'm guilty, too?

433
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:11,495
No. Fine.

434
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:14,064
I don't need you as a lawyer anymore.

435
00:15:14,098 --> 00:15:16,867
And if you two think
I'm such a bad driver,

436
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,802
You're safer walking home!

437
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:20,671
Ciao!

438
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,908
Here it is.

439
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,342
It's really cute!

440
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:27,212
Yeah. We're pretty proud of it.

441
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,648
Here's your stupid cds!

442
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,750
And your clothes! And your poems!

443
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,018
Don't you do it!

444
00:15:33,052 --> 00:15:34,586
Haley! I'm doing it!

445
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,588
Haley, stop it! What are you doing?!

446
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,056
Tearing out my heart!

447
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:39,858
Okay. Haley: Oh,
why don't you go get a hickey

448
00:15:39,892 --> 00:15:41,326
From sharon nicolini?!

449
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,762
It's from my guitar strap, haley!

450
00:15:43,796 --> 00:15:45,097
Oh, thanks for reminding me!

451
00:15:45,131 --> 00:15:49,701
Um, my daughter haley and
her boyfriend, dylan, um...

452
00:15:51,203 --> 00:15:52,304
This is a nice color.

453
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:53,605
Yeah. Um, listen.

454
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,907
This is not normal with all that, nor --

455
00:15:55,941 --> 00:15:57,808
Where's that liquor smell?

456
00:15:57,842 --> 00:15:58,842
Phil, honey?

457
00:15:58,877 --> 00:16:01,278
Oh, my god. Luke? What is that?

458
00:16:01,312 --> 00:16:02,412
Jagermeister.

459
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:04,881
Dad says it makes girls easier to kiss.

460
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:06,082
What happened to the rug?!

461
00:16:06,116 --> 00:16:07,383
I had an accident.

462
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,951
Okay. Alex, what are you doing?

463
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,619
I'm trying to kill a rat.

464
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:12,687
Oh...

465
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,689
Sharon was helping me buy
you a birthday present!

466
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,724
<i>Don't you get it?
! I love your ass!</i>

467
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,494
I -- you know, I-I-I'm late.

468
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,928
And I should go. I know.

469
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,096
I know. Yeah.

470
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,131
And it seems like things

471
00:16:23,165 --> 00:16:24,599
Have gotten a little wonky around here.

472
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:26,334
I don't know where phil is.

473
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:27,368
He's definitely --

474
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,271
Oh, my god!

475
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:31,472
Alex!

476
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,807
Where is your father?

477
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,743
He went outside to go to the bathroom.

478
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,545
Uh-huh. Oh!

479
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,780
it's not usually like this.

480
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:40,817
Oh, gross.

481
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,418
Let's just get married.

482
00:16:42,453 --> 00:16:44,220
Okay.

483
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,823
You will not regret this decision,
mrs. Patterson.

484
00:16:46,858 --> 00:16:48,325
And I'll tell you what --

485
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,327
We're gonna have you over to our
little house to celebrate, okay?

486
00:16:50,362 --> 00:16:51,896
Okay. Buh-bye.

487
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,865
Sometime when you get a break,
maybe -- claire!

488
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,299
Claire! Phil.

489
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>Hey. Phil, what are you -- what are you
doing?</i>

490
00:16:57,803 --> 00:16:59,704
Just concluding a little business.

491
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:01,472
Very successfully, I might add.

492
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:02,807
Honey.

493
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:03,807
Hey. Hi.

494
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:05,009
Is that valerie? Yeah.

495
00:17:05,043 --> 00:17:06,410
Whoa!

496
00:17:06,444 --> 00:17:07,545
You look fantastic.

497
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,013
Thank you. Come here!

498
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:10,547
Oh... Get over here!

499
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:12,315
Okay. I'll...

500
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,483
How long's it been?

501
00:17:13,517 --> 00:17:15,318
A long time. Oh, my goodness.

502
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:16,720
<i>Oh, I can't touch you. Okay.</i>

503
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:17,787
A little bit difficult.

504
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:18,855
The gulf divides us, eh?

505
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:19,989
So nice to see you.

506
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:21,357
Great to see you, though. Okay.

507
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:22,691
All right. Okay, then.

508
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:24,026
Thanks for coming by.

509
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,494
It's such a pleasure. Buh-bye.

510
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,362
Thanks for stopping by.
You have a beautiful family.

511
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:28,363
Yeah.

512
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,497
She looks great, doesn't she?

513
00:17:29,532 --> 00:17:30,564
What is on your face?

514
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,038
One time!

515
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,372
Once!

516
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:41,075
One time I bring somebody
home who I want to impress,

517
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:42,476
And what do I find?!

518
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,612
A bunch of booze-drenched hill people!

519
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,480
You're sitting around in your underwear

520
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:47,915
And -- and chasing rats

521
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:50,318
And -- and fornicating in the stairwell?

522
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:51,719
Can I say something? No!

523
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,388
No, you can't, mario.

524
00:17:53,423 --> 00:17:55,790
The is nothing left
to say but thank you.

525
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,759
<i>Thank you all.</i>

526
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:09,206
Ow!

527
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,508
I told you I'd win!

528
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:13,177
Not talking so much now,
are you, hotshot?

529
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:15,613
Hope you enjoy that nice hot shower.

530
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:20,685
But it's not gonna wash away the
shame of that 15-7 beatdown.

531
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:23,721
you should have seen
the look on your face

532
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:25,456
When that drop shot
just kissed the wall.

533
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,824
Ah. Okay.

534
00:18:26,858 --> 00:18:30,260
Splashdown. Got me again. Yep.

535
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,462
Make the uptight straight
guy all embarrassed,

536
00:18:32,497 --> 00:18:34,998
Except for one thing
doesn't even bother me anymore.

537
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,066
I could do this all day.
Here. Another one for you.

538
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,369
Maybe a couple of them.

539
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:42,037
Jay, I just noticed the sauna back here.

540
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,338
How big of a hurry are we in?

541
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,973
Biggest hurry of your life.

542
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,443
Scuse me. Scuse me.

543
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,311
Well, if you're going to be stranded,

544
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:52,513
Might as well be in a
place full of cupcakes.

545
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,382
I don't think you need any more.

546
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,717
Ay.

547
00:18:56,752 --> 00:18:58,219
I'm sorry, guys.

548
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:01,490
<i>It's true. I am a
defensive driver.</i>

549
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:02,891
You mean you're defensive about --

550
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:04,827
<i>I know what I am.</i>

551
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,529
Let's go.

552
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,464
It's just that I don't like

553
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:11,668
<i>When people just assume that I'm a bad
driver.</i>

554
00:19:11,702 --> 00:19:14,771
<i>Maybe it was just like a little bit my
fault.</i>

555
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:16,806
Well, you know, I'm glad
you can admit that, gloria.

556
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,142
Ay. But I'm still gonna need
you as my lawyer, mitch.

557
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,610
Why? Because this one --

558
00:19:21,645 --> 00:19:24,113
<i>It was not my fault.</i>

559
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:26,548
I promise you.

560
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,549
That's what that sound was.

561
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,418
It was the big cupcake.

562
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,821
That was unreal. Mom was crazy.

563
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:35,489
I'm scared.

564
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:37,157
Look...

565
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:39,426
I know your mom pretty well. She's fine.

566
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,995
I'd be willing to bet she's
just composing herself,

567
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,431
Taking a nice, lg,
peaceful walk in the park.

568
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:55,108
Perfect.

569
00:19:56,677 --> 00:20:00,981
At that moment, all I wanted
was to be with my family.

570
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:03,350
But of course, that meant
finding a way to apologize

571
00:20:03,384 --> 00:20:06,654
To the people that I had
belittled and rejected.

572
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,656
Okay, you are so crazy.
That song totally rules.

573
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:10,858
<i>Dad, you're crazy.</i>

574
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:12,159
Crazy right.

575
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:13,494
Hey, honey. Hi.

576
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:14,695
Hey, mom.

577
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:16,430
No, seriously, dad. It's lame.

578
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:17,765
Seriously, luke. It's not.

579
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,834
Here, you got some mustard
or something on your face.

580
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,868
I think I know a little bit about music.

581
00:20:21,903 --> 00:20:23,303
I was a deejay in college.

582
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,540
I had my own show in the
coveted time slot --

583
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:26,708
"daybreak with dunphy."

584
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,109
Are you kidding me?

585
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,310
No, I'm not kidding you.

586
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,378
And I played rick astley.

587
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:31,613
Dad, that -- that's embarrassing.

588
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,647
* never gonna... *

589
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,815
Sing it, luke.

590
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,516
They could have been petty.

591
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:38,553
They really could have made me pay,
but they didn't.

592
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,855
And I've never loved them more.

593
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:43,758
<i>Why the hell couldn't valerie have seen
them like that?</i>

594
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,990
Hey, dylan.

595
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:56,091
Hey, mr. Dunphy.

596
00:20:56,126 --> 00:20:57,426
What's happening?

597
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,028
Well, haley and i got
into another fight.

598
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:01,729
Oh. Yeah.

599
00:21:01,764 --> 00:21:04,132
"say anything..."

600
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,333
Um, "good morning"?

601
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,435
No, "say anything..."

602
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:10,070
"newspaper."

603
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,606
No, dylan. "say anything...
" clutch movie.

604
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,274
"clutch movie."

605
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:18,511
She probably won't be up
for a couple hours still.

606
00:21:18,546 --> 00:21:20,246
It's okay. It's not that heavy.

607
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:21,514
* do me *

608
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:21,814
* underneath the moonlight *

609
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:26,815
