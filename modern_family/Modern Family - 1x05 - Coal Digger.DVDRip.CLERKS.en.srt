'Cause it's not
just the game.

152
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:45,196
It's-It's the bands and the drama,
the pageantry.

153
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,032
Don't forget about
the team mascots.
They wear ascots?

154
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,451
No. Mascots.
With an "M."

155
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,453
That could have been
very embarrassing.

156
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,455
Okay.

157
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,541
Am I straight?

158
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm not sure
what you are right now.
Hmm?

159
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:02,964
Hi, hi, hi, hi!
How ya doin'?

160
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,799
Hey, Gramps.
Hi, beautiful.

161
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:06,551
Hi, Phil.
Good to see ya.

162
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:09,053
Let me guess.
Game's on?
Just started.

163
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,556
Hey. For you.

164
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,809
It's nice to see you,
Gloria.
Ah! Two times today.

165
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,103
Okay, well-
[Claire]
Uh, Phil?

166
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,272
She means
we've seen them
two times today.

167
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,691
Okay, everybody,
the food's in there.
The drinks are in there.

168
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,319
- I'll be in here.
- Hold on, Jay.

169
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,821
I think we should address
the elephant in the room.

170
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,700
Uh, Luke, Manny.
Bring it in.

171
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,079
Come on. Huddle up.
Football.

172
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,999
Now in light of what
happened at school today,

173
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,084
do you have any feelings
you'd like to express?

174
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,878
I think this is
the proper forum-

175
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,714
For God's sakes.
All right, both of you.

176
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,258
Now, in this family,
do we kick and punch
each other,

177
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,010
or do we
love each other?

178
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,346
[Manny, Luke]
Love each other.
That's right.

179
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,389
I'II be in the den.

180
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,811
So, I brought dessert.

181
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,813
Okay. Thank you.

182
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,316
I make pie too.

183
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,569
You can never have
too many pies, right?

184
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,571
Okay, whoa. Whoa.

185
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,616
Everybody take a deep breath.
Let's think about getting real.

186
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,327
- Phil, no.
- Why "Phil, no"?

187
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,454
What is Phil doing?
[Phil]
I'm just gonna say it.

188
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,414
There's tension
between you two.

189
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,750
Bam. It's out there.
I'm gonna kill you.

190
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:24,420
I think he's right,
and I think we should
talk about it.

191
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,173
That's what
I'm talkin' 'bout-

192
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:30,343
you two talking...

193
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,428
'bout it.

194
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,183
[Male Announcer]
First and goal to go for the Illini.
[Alex] I like football.

195
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,353
Haley hates it, which is weird
because it's all boys...

196
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,438
and there's
no reading required.

197
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:46,150
Do you know that she
spends at least 45 minutes
every morning doing her hair?

198
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,152
And then sometimes-

199
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,154
♪ Let's go, Illini ♪

200
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,156
Let's go!
Right now!
[Muffled]

201
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,617
Looks like
I gotta watch the game
with Dick Butkus.

202
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:56,703
Dad! Dad, come on.
That's offensive.

203
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,247
Mitchell, he's one
of the greatest linebackers
to ever play at Illinois...

204
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,416
and one of my personal heroes.

205
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,292
And his name is "Butt-kiss"?

206
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:06,713
We're just choosing to-
Okay. All right.

207
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:08,715
Dad, I thought you were
being homophobic. I'm sorry.

208
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,842
We got all night.
Yes, we do.

209
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:14,512
- Are you joining us here?
- Yeah. Jay, you know what?
He's been studying up.

210
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,223
I gotta tell ya,
I'm a little worried
about C.J. Hightower.

211
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:20,643
Right? With the bad ankle?
I'm wondering how he's gonna
run his corner routes.

212
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:23,438
- Hightower's out.
- What?

213
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,440
Oh. Then who is gonna
run the corner routes?

214
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,233
I'll tell you who it won't be-
Billings.

215
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,694
[Chuckling]
That's low. He's in jail.

216
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,071
Oh, wow. Yeah.
Then no.

217
00:09:32,156 --> 00:09:34,699
Double tight end,
it's gonna be a quarterback
roll-out to the left.

218
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:39,078
[Jay] They're gonna run it.
Trust me. He's got the slot.
In the end zone! Touchdown!

219
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,623
Lucky call.
Maybe they, uh, should've
considered blitzing.

220
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,709
Blitzing wouldn't have helped them.
Get outta here.

221
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:48,254
Oh, gosh. Blitzing.
[Laughs]

222
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:51,632
So, my interest in football
ended as suddenly
and dramatically...

223
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,177
as the climax
of West Side Story.

224
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,179
I'm a musical theater fan.

225
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,348
Surprise.

226
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:03,394
Okay. The truth?
I sometimes feel
like you don't like me.

227
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,396
Wow.

228
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,940
Powerful, powerful stuff.

229
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,901
Claire? Tell us
how that makes you feel.

230
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,446
Right now, I'm feeling
a lot of anger.
No, don't tell me. Tell her.

231
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,531
Gloria, right now,
I'm really angry
at Phil.

232
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,366
[Phil]
Let's respect the process.

233
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,786
[Sighs]

234
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,747
Gloria, I don't know
why you think
I don't like you.

235
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:25,792
Sometimes when you see me,
you make that face.
What face?

236
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,336
- Like this.
- I do not make a face like that.

237
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,338
Oh, my God.
That is so Claire.
Mitchell!

238
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,634
See? She does that
with everyone.
It's just her face.

239
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,969
No, it's not just the face.

240
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:40,348
From the beginning,
I feel like Manny and I
are not welcome in this family.

241
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:44,811
That is so crazy.
No, it's not so crazy.
It's how I feel.

242
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,563
[Muttering]

243
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,942
[Sighs]
I am sorry
if you feel that way.

244
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:54,195
I really am, because
from the moment I met you,

245
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:57,615
I have tried to make you
feel comfortable with us.

246
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,034
You think it's all in my head?

247
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,119
No. Kind-
I don't know.

248
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:06,165
I mean, we really love
having you and Manny
in our family.

249
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,375
Really?
Really.

250
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,044
So, you don't have
to be so defensive.

251
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,380
I do that, don't I?

252
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,007
[Chuckling]
Well, a bit.

253
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,511
I'm feeling a hug.
[Gloria, Claire Chuckling]

254
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:21,472
I was thinking group hug,
but this is nice.

255
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,724
I'd be there if I could.
Oh, my God. There's hugging.

256
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:25,768
Haley, get off
the phone already.

257
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,188
[Cameron] Where did you go?
You heard him.
He said, "Get outta here."

258
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:31,023
Oh, my God.
You're such a girl.

259
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,568
Dad- I was coming
to get a beer anyways.

260
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:36,404
Nice apology.
Nice beer.

261
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,866
- [Manny, Luke Laughing]
- Hey, there are the little roustabouts.

262
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:43,327
You look like you patched
things up pretty good, huh?
[Together] Yeah.

263
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,872
Oh, we can learn so much
from the children.

264
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:49,375
Bet it seems kind of silly now
what you were even
fighting about, huh?

265
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:52,628
- I made fun of his accent.
- What accent?

266
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,089
I made fun of him for having
the same thing for lunch every day.

267
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:59,260
- [Gloria] Eegh!
- I made fun of him because
his mom used to dig coal.

268
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,262
What?

269
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,097
He said you were
a coal digger.

270
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,224
Okay. I think
we can move on.
[Chuckling]

271
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,101
Who said I was a coal digger?

272
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:10,229
That's what
my mom told me.
What's a coal digger?

273
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,273
Sweetheart,
he heard it wrong.
It's "gold digger."

274
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,275
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

275
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,194
I really do not think that
I remember ever saying that.

276
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,572
Well, you said in the car.

277
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,116
You said it at Christmas.
You said it in the Mexican restaurant-

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,202
Okay, Mr. "Leaves His Sweatshirts
at School Every Day...

279
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:27,288
Suddenly Remembers
Everything," thank you.

280
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,374
And it was all
in my head, huh?

281
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,338
Oh, listen. Gloria, it was... like,
a year ago, before I knew you.

282
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,674
Nice going. Now my mom
and my sister are fighting.

283
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,056
If I say something that
everybody else is thinking,

284
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,058
does that make me
a mean person?

285
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,770
Or does it make me
a brave person?

286
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:55,274
One who is courageous enough
to stand up and-and say something...

287
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:58,277
behind someone's back to...
a 10-year-old.

288
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,698
[Water Running In Sink]
Well, she's pissed.

289
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,576
Yeah. She wouldn't even
come out of her room.
Oh.

290
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:08,579
Did you really have
to call her that-
a gold digger?

291
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,790
Well, you know what, Dad?
It was a year ago.

292
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,459
And it was a natural
question to ask.

293
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,878
She's a beautiful, hot woman,

294
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,631
and you're not exactly,
you know-

295
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,883
Not exactly what?

296
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,011
Um- Mitchell, little help?

297
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:26,013
No. You are doing great.

298
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,058
See, this is exactly why
we sweep things
under the rug-

299
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,977
so people don't get hurt.

300
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,271
Yeah, until you sweep
too much under the rug.
Then you got a lumpy rug.

301
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,526
Creates a tripping hazard.
You open yourself up to lawsuits.

302
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,945
Boy, you can go a really
long time without blinking.

303
00:13:47,703 --> 00:13:50,413
Gloria? It's Phil.

304
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,541
Hi. Can I talk to you
for a second?

305
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,460
Claire likes to say
you can be part of the problem...

306
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:58,546
or part of the solution.

307
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,132
But I happen to believe
that you can be both.

308
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,928
Listen, Claire feels terrible.

309
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,014
Why don't you talk to her?

310
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:11,851
Why? I know what she thinks-
a coal digger.

311
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,520
- You know she's saying
"gold digger"?
- Yes, Phil!

312
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,272
Well, I-I know
she said that.

313
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,066
But that was
a long time ago,
before she knew you.

314
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,277
Does Jay buy me
nice things?

315
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,529
Yes! Of course!
All beautiful things.

316
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,657
Look at this-
yellow, red, blue.

317
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,659
All the colors.

318
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:32,079
Do you think I can't
live without this?
Take them away, Phil.

319
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:37,418
Gloria, we all know
you'd be fine
without underwear.

320
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,046
I mean, we know
it's not about that.

321
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,091
No. It's about me
not being accepted
by my new family.

322
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:48,262
That is not true.
Gloria, look, you're
a beautiful woman.

323
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:51,557
In fact, you're probably one
of those beautiful women
who doesn't even know it.

324
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,934
No, I know it.

325
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,605
So it's natural for Claire
to wonder about you
and her dad.

326
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,983
This family's very protective
of each other.

327
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:04,028
I remember the first time
Claire brought me home.

328
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,947
Do you think Jay thought
I was good enough
for his little girl?

329
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,326
No way.
But over time,

330
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,662
he realized that I loved Claire
as much as he did.

331
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,290
And by then, Mitch
had brought Cam home,
so I was golden.

332
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:20,503
Claire just needs
a little time.

333
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:24,131
And then, trust me, she'll
be the most loyal friend
you've ever had.

334
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,345
You're not leaving,
are you?

335
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,472
You know, there's kind of
a lot of drama.

336
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,724
So we're torn.
Let me ask you
something.

337
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:38,771
Your sister said that Gloria
would never go for anybody
who looked like me.

338
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,733
Now, you guys basically
are like women.

339
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,277
You know,
you look at guys.

340
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:47,196
So what do you think?

341
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,573
You're seriously asking us
if you're attractive?

342
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,659
Well, I know
I'm no Erik Estrada
or anything.

343
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm just curious
is all.
Dad.

344
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,873
So if I was in
one of your bars and-
[Clears Throat]

345
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,917
Righteous Brothers
were on, you know.

346
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,836
Would you, uh,

347
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,463
I don't know,
check me out?

348
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,341
Dad, you're really close
to ruining gay for me.

349
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,468
All right, fine.
Whatever.
Jay. Jay, now listen.

350
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:14,306
I think it's- I just think
it's a little weird for a son
to say this to his father.

351
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:18,060
But for the record,
I think you're smokin' hot.
Really?

352
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,521
Yeah, 100%.
You're totally my type.

353
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,690
You're dangerous,
you're getable,

354
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,526
you have a little "cashola"
in your pocket.
[Chuckles]

355
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:30,990
Face, body, the whole-
The whole kit and caboodle,
I think. Really.

356
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:33,409
What about a seven?
Nine. For sure, nine.

357
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,120
But you knew that.
I might have lowballed
a little bit.

358
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,205
Okay, isn't there
a game on?

359
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,668
Touchy.
I know.

360
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,215
Gloria? Come on, let's-
let's talk about this.

361
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,594
I've seen her
kick in a door before.

362
00:16:56,933 --> 00:17:00,060
I don't know
what my husband
is saying to you or...

363
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,146
why he's covered
in your underwear.

364
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,984
Obviously I'm trying to
seduce him for his money.

365
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,153
[Forced Chuckle] That's-
'Cause that's
what I do, right?

366
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,946
What do I have
to give back...

367
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,783
so that everyone
trusts me? Huh?

368
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,493
These earrings?
[Together]
No.

369
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,288
What? This bracelet?
[Together]
No.

370
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,832
My new dress?
No.

371
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:28,214
I didn't respond because...

372
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:32,551
this shouldn't be about me.

373
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,386
It should be about you...

374
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:38,474
talking to you...
about it.

375
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,978
Phil? Honey?

376
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,939
No, no, no. No.

377
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,858
You're welcome.

378
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,319
[Door Closes]

379
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,697
I don't know what to say
except for that I am
really, really sorry.

380
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:59,286
Just tell me one thing.
How do you really feel
that I'm with your father?

381
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,538
Uh, well-

382
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,540
Honestly, at first,
it was hard.

383
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,668
I mean, you don't expect
to wake up one morning...

384
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,963
with a new mom who looks like
she fell off a mud flap.

385
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,757
But... I'm getting
used to it.

386
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:16,011
And the important thing
is you make him happy,

387
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:19,598
which you do in-
in so many ways,

388
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,059
so many colors.

389
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,272
Are we okay?

390
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,607
- No.
- No?

391
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,235
You embarrassed me
in front of everyone
downstairs.

392
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,612
What, I'm supposed
just to forget about it?

393
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:37,241
What do you want me to do-
just embarrass myself
so we're even?

394
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,869
Go jump in the pool.
Oh, you mean
go jump in a lake. Right.

395
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,290
Go jump in the pool
with your clothes on.
Then I know you're sorry.

396
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm not gonna do that,
Gloria.

397
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,336
Okay. Then I won't
forgive you.

398
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,382
[TV Playing]
Now a field goal beats us.

Hey, you guys
work that out?

400
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,386
Almost. Gloria just wants me
to jump in the pool.

401
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,430
Okay then.
What?

402
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:03,392
If they could get
a pass rush on 'em,
something, a break.

403
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,773
This is so awesome.

00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,859
I know. Mom does not
look good wet.

Gloria, is this
really necessary?

406
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,905
Dad, it's fine. It's fine.
If I need to jump
in this water...

407
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,241
to prove to Gloria
how sorry I am,
I will do it.

408
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm fine.

You're not gonna stop me?
- Why would I do that?

410
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:29,460
Because I am standing here.
I am showing you
my willingness to-

No?

I hate that.

I played center,
and I always got blamed for
a quarterback's clumsy hands.

Well, I was a quarterback,
and it was probably your fault.

427
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,387
It's impossible
to fumble the ball...

428

when the quarterback has
the proper hand placement.

It's weird to think of a woman
being sexually attracted to Dad.

No, you wanna hear weird?

at a gay bar.

Mmm, I'm really trying
to block it out.
