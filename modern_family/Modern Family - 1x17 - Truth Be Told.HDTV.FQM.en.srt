00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:50,965
You almost had to what? Shout.

161
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,466
Little bit louder now. Shout!

162
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,035
Little bit louder now. Shout!!

163
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:56,037
* hey, hey, hey, hey * [ laughs ]

164
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:57,138
Really, cam?

165
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,806
My job is at stake here and --

166
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,107
Oh, w-who are we kidding?

167
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,943
You can obviously hear me.
I am so screwed.

168
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:04,345
[ sighs ]

169
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,213
Jay: Manny?

170
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,748
Manny, come here a second, pal.

171
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:08,916
Huh?

172
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,284
I got some bad news, buddy.

173
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:11,218
What iit?

174
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,521
Well, there's no
easy way to say this.

175
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:18,325
Shel turtlestein is dead.

176
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,127
I was down here reading the paper,

177
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,596
And I heard this commotion
up in your room, so...

178
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,665
So naturally I go running up there.

179
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,135
And this mangy raccoon had
busted through your screen.

180
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,237
He must have scampered
up to where shel was.

181
00:06:32,507 --> 00:06:34,108
By the time I walked in,
he had him --

182
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:36,177
The little bastard had him
by the neck, shaking him.

183
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:39,046
Gravel's flying everywhere.

184
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,147
He didn't even flinch.

185
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,049
He just stared at me
with that smug look

186
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,517
And then bolted.

187
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:47,088
If only I'd have got here earlier.

188
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,789
May I see the body?

189
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,624
Baby, are you sure
that's a good idea?

190
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,093
It's something I have to do.

191
00:06:54,863 --> 00:06:56,597
That's him. Sorry, pal.

192
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,365
It just doesn' make any sense.

193
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,867
Yep. Only the good die young.

194
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,836
But in school we leaed
raccoons are nocturnal.

195
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,204
They sleep during the day.

196
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:05,106
They sure do,
and this one must've got up

197
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,273
For a midnight snack.

198
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,541
You know, we've all done that.

199
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,876
I guess so. Yeah.

200
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,177
It all adds up.

201
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,179
I don't think I can
be in here right now.

202
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,914
Too many memories.

203
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,383
He'll be okay.

204
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,120
You lie. What?

205
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:20,254
I'm colombian.

206
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:22,756
I know a fake crime
scene when I see one!

207
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,726
I was hanging up the new poster.

208
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,528
And it fell on top of him.
It was an accident.

209
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,963
You have to tell him.

210
00:07:28,997 --> 00:07:30,598
No. I've been through this before.

211
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:31,665
When mitchell was 9,

212
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,501
I was suosed to take
care of his bird.

213
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:35,636
It got out and flew into a fan.

214
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,471
It was like a bloody pillow fight.

215
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,840
My god. How many pets have
you killed? Just the two.

216
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,842
I took the heat on the bird.
It was a big mistake.

217
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:44,345
To this day, mitchell looks at me,
I see him thinking,

218
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:46,380
"that's the guy who
killed fly-za minnelli."

219
00:07:46,414 --> 00:07:48,516
And what if he finds out?
Then what?

220
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,519
You'll be the guy that killed
his pet and lied to him.

221
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:54,121
He's not gonna find out,
because I covered my tracks.

222
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:56,590
Okay.

223
00:07:57,626 --> 00:07:58,826
Fly-za minnelli?

224
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,462
How did I not know
that kid was gay?

225
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:05,766
Hey, luke! Big day for you, huh?

226
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,101
Why?

227
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:09,870
<i>Because you get to meet
your real mom. What?</i>

228
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:13,007
We all made a pact we'd
deny it until you turned 21,

229
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,109
But that's the real reason

230
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:16,944
Dad's old girlfriend
is coming over.

231
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:19,113
She's your mom,
and if she likes you,

232
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:20,681
You'll go live with her.

233
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:22,116
I'm not adopted.

234
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,651
I'm asking mom.

235
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:25,352
You mean mrs. Dunphy?

236
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,154
She's not going to
tell you the truth.

237
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:28,856
I-I-I'm not...

238
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,625
I know. Unh!

239
00:08:33,895 --> 00:08:38,299
Just 'cause he called you
a dork-to-dork salesman?

240
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:40,568
The empire strikes back.

241
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:42,836
<i>Raccoons have five toes.</i>

242
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:43,904
What's that?

243
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:45,439
I don't mean to bother you.

244
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:46,707
It's just confusing.

245
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,243
The footprints in my
room only have four toes.

246
00:08:49,277 --> 00:08:51,478
You know, I bet I know wt happened.

247
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:54,682
I'll bet he lost those
toes in a fight.

248
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:57,151
And that guy looked like
he'd been in a brawl or two.

249
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,619
One toe from each foot?

250
00:08:58,653 --> 00:08:59,653
Maybe.

251
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,055
Y-you know, manny,

252
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:03,290
I think the only thing
that's gonna get you

253
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,092
To stop asking all these questions

254
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:07,628
Is for you to have a little closure.
What do you mean?

255
00:09:07,662 --> 00:09:10,164
Well, I'd like to throw a
little memorial for shel.

256
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,765
It'll be good for all of us.

257
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,634
That way, we get our grief out,

258
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,971
And then we never have to
talk about this ever...

259
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,340
Ever again.

260
00:09:19,374 --> 00:09:22,276
[ doorbell rings ]

261
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,345
[ giggling ] hi!

262
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,913
Oh, careful, there's a thing.
Ooh. That's a...

263
00:09:25,947 --> 00:09:27,581
[ giggling ] good to see you.

264
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:28,682
Hi!

265
00:09:28,717 --> 00:09:31,685
Hi! Oh, my gosh! Hi, I'm claire.

266
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,654
You must be d-- o-kay.

267
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:34,822
Whoa. Okay. Denise.

268
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:36,457
Oh, and you're even prettier

269
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:38,826
Than the pictures that
phil's always posting.

270
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,094
Just a couple.

271
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:43,197
Shut up. Every week.
He loves showing you off.

272
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:44,832
My boyfriend likes
your acapulco pictures

273
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:46,000
Probably a little too much.

274
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,268
[ chuckles ]

275
00:09:47,302 --> 00:09:49,336
Well, thank your
boyfriend for me. Sure.

276
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,504
Come on in. Plea.

277
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:51,905
Oh, I brought you, um,

278
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,908
Some lifting intensifier.

279
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,909
Not that you need it.

280
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,344
It's a limited edition, so...

281
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:58,746
Thank you. Thank you.

282
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,914
Phil: Oh, denise, I think
you might know these people.

283
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,383
That's haley... Hi.

284
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,584
...Alex, and --

285
00:10:03,618 --> 00:10:05,152
Luke! Ohh!

286
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,289
I had curly hair just like
that when I was little.

287
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:11,625
So? That doesn't mean anything!

288
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:14,461
[ alex chuckles ]

289
00:10:14,496 --> 00:10:18,032
Why don't we, uh, come on in,
have a seat? Please.

290
00:10:18,066 --> 00:10:20,067
So, what was my dad
like in high school?

291
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,536
Only the most amazing
breakdancer ever.

292
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,204
Uh-oh. Don't fire it up.

293
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,873
What? What? Uh-oh.

294
00:10:25,907 --> 00:10:27,541
Oh, no. Yeah.

295
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:29,877
He had a boombox and a piece
of cardboard in his locker.

296
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:32,046
And what was your dance name?
O-zone. Yeah.

297
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,747
I drove him to a "star
search" audition.

298
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:35,516
Which is totally political,
by the way.

299
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,252
O-zone. That is dead-ass funny.

300
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm so calling you that.

301
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:40,721
Thank you.

302
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,823
Wow. You really lucked out.

303
00:10:42,857 --> 00:10:44,725
You have a beautiful wife... Ohh.

304
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,560
...A gorgeous house,
and those kids.

305
00:10:46,594 --> 00:10:48,262
I could take luke home with me.

306
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,331
Well, be my guest.

307
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,665
Seriously. You go right ahead.

308
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,766
[ laughter ]

309
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,734
No!

310
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,636
I like it here!

311
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,705
Unh!

312
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:59,173
Alex, honey, will you go find out

313
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:00,574
What's wrong with your brother?

314
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:02,676
Okay.

315
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:04,345
You know, um,  it's okay,

316
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,013
I think I'm just
gonna use the, um...

317
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,281
Oh, yeah, of course.

318
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:09,717
Down the hall, left-hand side.
You can't miss it.

319
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:11,985
Denise: Thanks.

320
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:15,522
Okay, she's fantastic. Yes?

321

00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,787
I'm excited for you. Yes!

482
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:26,156
It's exciting. It's exciting.

483
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:29,192
Because you followed your heart,
and that is worth celebrating.

484
00:17:29,227 --> 00:17:30,994
Cam, I just feel -- ha-ha! --

485
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:34,197
So liberated.

486
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:35,365
Hey!

487
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,967
And I'm not picking it up.

488
00:17:37,001 --> 00:17:38,201
Ooh! I like this guy!

489
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:39,870
I do, too. I mean,
y-yes, we'll have to --

490
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:41,371
We'll have to cut
back a little bit.

491
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:42,739
But isn't it worth it if you feel

492
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:44,641
Like you're living your
life for the first time?

493
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:46,510
Totally. Oh. What were
we even waiting for?

494
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:47,945
You will go back to teaching music,

495
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:51,081
And then I'll -- I'll just fin.

496
00:17:51,115 --> 00:17:52,516
And until then, all we need to do

497
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,817
Is just sit back

498
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,653
And watch this little
miracle here dazzle us.

499
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:57,721
I'm tingling.

500
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:59,323
I am, too.

501
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:02,025
It's like my heart is full for
the first time in forever.

502
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,328
Oh, god, it's really pounding.

503
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,396
It's like I feel the weight
of endless possibilities

504
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,231
Just sitting on my chest.

505
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:09,800
She is not doing anything, cam.

506
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,635
You're not panicking,
are you? Of course I am panicking!

507
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,903
No! Don't panic.
If you panic, I panic!

508
00:18:12,937 --> 00:18:15,472
I just quit my job! Cam!

509
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:16,807
Oh, my god, mitchell,
I am used to nice things!

510
00:18:16,841 --> 00:18:18,141
What are we gonna do?!

511
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,710
Okay, no, no,
just calm -- calm down.

512
00:18:19,744 --> 00:18:21,578
This is what we're gonna do.
I am going to --

513
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,146
I'm gonna do what
I'm trained to do.

514
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:24,815
I am going to lie,
grovel, debase myself

515
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:26,083
Until I get what I want.

516
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,384
I am a lawyer, damn it.

517
00:18:27,418 --> 00:18:29,653
Mitchell!

518
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:30,887
No.

519
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:32,255
Oh, no, you're right -- the tie.

520
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,725
No, we'll -- we'll find
something better for you,

521
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,660
Something that works for all of us.

522
00:18:36,694 --> 00:18:38,895
There's no plan "b" here, cam.

523
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,163
We have a mortgage. We have --

524
00:18:40,198 --> 00:18:43,100
We have a -
a child to support. I --

525
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:45,235
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

526
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,371
We're gonna figure it out.

527
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:49,973
<i>I just want you to be happy,
and you will be happy.</i>

528
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:53,977
And that is something
worth toasting.

529
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:56,813
Let's just drink the cheap stuff

530
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:58,649
'cause we might have
to sell that bottle.

531
00:18:58,683 --> 00:19:00,684
[ sighs ]

532
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:06,189
It's hard to sleep in a bed of lies,
isn't it, jay?

533
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,258
Kids get over these
things pretty quick.

534
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:10,527
He's probably sleeping
like a baby right now.

535
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,329
I'm sure he's wide awake...

536
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,864
Full of guilt.

537
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:16,600
Well, I'm going to sleep.

538
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:21,171
[ sighs ]

539
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,042
[ sighs ]

540
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:27,077
Damn it!

541
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,579
[ knock on door ]

542
00:19:31,616 --> 00:19:33,383
Hello, jay.

543
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:35,619
What are you doing up?

544
00:19:35,653 --> 00:19:37,587
Waiting. Waiting for what?

545
00:19:37,622 --> 00:19:38,755
The truth.

546
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,490
It wasn't a raccoon, was it?

547
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,460
Oh, all right, you got me.
I killed shel.

548
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:46,029
All right? I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

549
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,297
Why didn't you just tell me?

550
00:19:47,331 --> 00:19:49,866
Cause I didn't want you
to be upset with me.

551
00:19:49,901 --> 00:19:52,436
You and I got off to a rocky start.

552
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,137
But lately it's been pretty good.

553
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:55,739
I was afraid I'd mess all that up

554
00:19:55,773 --> 00:19:58,141
If you knew that I was the
one that killed your pet.

555
00:19:58,176 --> 00:19:59,476
Now you're the guy
who killed my pet

556
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,677
And made a stupid lie about it.

557
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:01,945
Well, I don't think it was stupid.

558
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:03,180
I thought it was pretty clever.

559
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:07,517
Look, I s just trying
to avoid past miakes.

560
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,952
Look...

561
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:12,422
I know I can't make things
all better right now,

562
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,525
Maybe.

563
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,261
Get some rest.

564
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,630
Since we're confessing things...

565
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,766
You know that scratch on your car?

566
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,634
The one that can't
be buffed out? Yeah.

567
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:26,403
You should probably
know how it happened.

568
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:27,637
I know how it happened.

569
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,807
Raccoon did it.

570
00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:33,811
Good night, jay. Good night, kid.

571
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:40,252
Best thing I ever did was quit a miserable
job and start my own business. thanks, dad.

572
00:20:40,287 --> 00:20:41,654
Now, it's not gonna be easy,

573
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,355
But that's why gloria and I want
to give you a little something

574
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,024
To help you through it.

575
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:46,742
No, dad, I can't.

576
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,610
<i>No, I want to, mitch.</i>

577
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,646
Okay, but, I mean,
a-as soon as I'm back on my feet,

578
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,914
I-I really want to --

579
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:55,317
Oh. Oh. Dad. No, you --

580
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:57,219
You tried to give
me this 20 years ago

581
00:20:57,253 --> 00:20:58,287
When my pet snake died.

582
00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,189
I did? Yes.

583
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,390
Zsa-zsa ga-boa.

584
00:21:01,424 --> 00:21:02,925
Oh, that's adorable.

585
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,527
And you really didn't
know that he was gay?

586
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:08,564
I must have, right?

587
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,565
