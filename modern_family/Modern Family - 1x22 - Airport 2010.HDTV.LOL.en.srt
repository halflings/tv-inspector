1
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,300
Fall from...

2
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:13,568
Oh. [ laughs ]

3
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:16,437
Because I'm an angel!

4
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:17,772
Why are you so sweet?

5
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,973
Maybe just 'cause
I'm so damn happy.

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,251
Today is Jay's birthday.

7
00:00:22,286 --> 00:00:24,986
So I'm taking him to Hawaii
for a whole week.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,050
Big suite in Maui,
just the two of us.

9
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:29,251
Got Manny tied up
in the backyard --

10
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:30,452
Big bowl of kibble.

11
00:00:30,486 --> 00:00:31,820
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:33,822
He's staying
with Claire and Phil.

13
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,690
This whole thing
was a big surprise.

14
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,456
I did it all myself --

15
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:39,390
The flight, the hotels.

16
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:43,091
Cost me a fortune,
but it was worth it.

17
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,891
<i>Cost me a fortune.</i>

18
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,625
In case I forget to say it
a few hundred times this week,

19
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:50,758
Thank you.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,994
Happy Birthday!

21
00:00:54,029 --> 00:00:55,863
What the heck?!

22
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:57,364
Mwah!
Surprise, dad.

23
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:58,864
The whole family is coming with us!
Uh-huh.

24
00:00:58,898 --> 00:00:59,698
<i>They are?!</i>

25
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:00,833
Uh-huh.

26
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,701
Yes, and Mitch and Cameron
and Lily, too.

27
00:01:02,735 --> 00:01:04,502
Yeah, and Phil --
he's just checking the bags.

28
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:06,068
Wow. That's...

29
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:07,068
Wow!

30
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,236
Well, it was all Gloria's idea.

31
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:09,738
She bought all of our tickets
and everything.

32
00:01:09,773 --> 00:01:11,172
Really? Yeah.
Everyone's?

33
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,307
<i>It's your birthday.
I didn't spare any expense.</i>

34
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:14,841
Oh, gee.

35
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:16,410
Thank you, honey.

36
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,877
<i>Are they, uh, all gonna be
up with us in first class?</i>

37
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,313
Ay, no, silly goat.
You think I'm made of money?

38
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,714
Hmm!

39
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,349
Of course not.

40

41
00:01:40,464 --> 00:01:43,599
We're gonna go to a luau,
swim with the Miami dolphins,

42
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,534
Take a tour
in one of those --

43
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:46,869
The tkkita-tkkita-tkkita-
tkkita-tee-tee!

44
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:48,570
Helicopter.
Helicopter. Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:50,372
Yes!

46
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:51,774
I don't like activities.

47
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,440
I wanted to hang out with Gloria

48
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:55,307
And read
my Robert Ludlum novels.

49
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:57,876
I got eight of them loaded up
on my book-reader thing here.

50
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,344
I mean, I love my family.

51
00:01:59,378 --> 00:02:01,812
I love 'em at dinners,
I love 'em at barbecues,

52
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,315
But do I have to love 'em
in Hawaii?

53
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,949
Thanks, Daryl.

54
00:02:05,984 --> 00:02:07,351
I know I got a lot of baggage,

55
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:09,120
But don't worry,
I'm seeing a therapist.

56
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,554
Just kidding, I'm fine.

57
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,958
Hey!

58
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:16,896
Daryl, I know these guys.
Can I borrow your hat?

59
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,064
This will be hilarious.

60
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:19,998
No.
Okay.

61
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,733
Aloha, Uncle Phil!

62
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:24,103
Hey. Hey!
You guys excited about the trip?

63
00:02:24,137 --> 00:02:26,104
Oh, we're so excited.
You know, this is my first time.

64
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,073
Really?
Yeah, I know, it's surprising.

65
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,942
People always say
I scream "Hawaii."

66
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:31,276
Who says that?
People.

67
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,277
What people?

68
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,011
You don't know them.

69
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,147
Hey, Lily. Hi!

70
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,783
Oh, no. Oh, n--
I forgot my wallet!

71
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:41,284
Oh, that's all right.
I have cas

72
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:43,686
No, no, I can't get
on the plane without my I.D.

73
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,987
Thanks a lot, Cam.

74
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:46,622
<i>How is this my fault?</i>

75
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,824
Because if you had done what
I asked you to do this morning,

76
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:50,292
Then I wouldn't
have been overwhelmed

77
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:51,860
And I would have
remembered my wallet!

78
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:56,829
All right, we still need
to pack Lily's toys,

79
00:02:56,863 --> 00:02:58,296
Print the boarding passes --
oh [snaps fingers]

80
00:02:58,331 --> 00:02:59,898
Stop the newspaper.

81
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:01,566
Hey, no, wait. What are you
doing? I just packed those.

82
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,234
Oh, she just looks so cute
in this outfit.

83
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,802
I want her looking her best
for Jasper.

84
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,437
Nothing you just said
made any sense to me.

85
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,237
Jasper and his mother
are coming over for a playdate.

86
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,271
We scheduled it weeks ago.

87
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:10,638
We're about to leave
for the airport!

88
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:11,804
Not for an hour,

89
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,339
And this is the only time
Jasper could do it.

90
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,773
Really?
How full is Jasper's calendar?

91
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:15,873
This is a coup.

92
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:17,374
When you get in with Jasper,
doors open.

93
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,174
He's a legacy
at happy time preschool.

94
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:20,642
We're kissing up
to a 10-month old?

95
00:03:20,677 --> 00:03:21,843
I just want him to like us.

96
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:23,845
Okay, that's them.

97
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,112
All right, but just in and out.

98
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,380
You know, we still have
a million things to do.

99
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,414
Would you relax?

100
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:29,316
You always worry.
It always gets done.

101
00:03:30,284 --> 00:03:32,819
Oh, and we're methodists.

102
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,720
So...

103
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,123
Ah. Who am I kidding?
I-I'm not making this flight.

104
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,291
Unh-unh. I can get you home and
back before the plane takes off.

105
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:40,659
Let's go!

106
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,229
See if you can stall the plane.

107
00:03:44,263 --> 00:03:46,397
That's --
I will get you later.

108
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,699
I really -- I really don't think
there's enough time.

109
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,601
No, just -- I'll meet you
at the gate. Go!

110
00:03:50,635 --> 00:03:52,269
Okay, but you won't get
on the plane without me, right?

111
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:53,504
Oh. Well...

112
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:55,639
Seriously? You were gonna
get on the plane?! Cam!

113
00:03:55,673 --> 00:03:56,873
Just go!

114
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,441
Nope.
Gotta get that one.

115
00:03:58,476 --> 00:04:00,176
Door.
 okay.

116
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,344
I can't -- ohh.

117
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:02,843
All right.
That's as fast as she goes.

118
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,012
Just drive!
Just drive!

119
00:04:04,046 --> 00:04:06,080
Just drive!
I'll get the luggage!

120
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:09,147
Hey, check out that cute guy.

121
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,216
[ scoffs ]
he's out of your league.

122
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,684
He's reading a book.

123
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:14,085
I know.

124
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:19,256
Here today, gone to Maui!
Hey.

125
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,990
Have you seen Phil?

126
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:22,523
Oh, he drove Mitchell back
to get his wallet.

127
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:23,591
What?

128
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,226
Yeah, he said he's gonna
make it back in time,

129
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,493
But I think
it's gonna be close.

130
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,562
So he left me here.

131
00:04:30,331 --> 00:04:31,931
Haley is still asleep!

132
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,433
And I have no idea where Luke is.

133
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,600
And are you even ready?

134
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:35,902
My bag's in the living room.

135
00:04:35,936 --> 00:04:37,270
Everything's gonna be okay.

136
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:39,505
Okay, fine. I'm sorry,
I'm a little tense.

137
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:40,539
Coffee'll help that.

138
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:41,940
You're right.

139
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,809
We've been over this.
Air travel is incredibly safe.

140
00:04:44,844 --> 00:04:46,811
I know. I know,
but at the end of the day,

141
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,246
It is still a building
on its side

142
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,981
Being thrown
from one place to another.

143
00:04:50,015 --> 00:04:51,549
With a movie.
Not helping.

144
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:55,585
Do you want to take something,
maybe calm your nerves?

145
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:58,087
No. No, I want to be alert
if the kids need me.

146
00:04:58,122 --> 00:05:00,289
What a mom.

147
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,624
<i>Sometimes I wish
you were my mom.</i>

148
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:03,759
Oh, God, Phil.

149
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:06,695
I'm already feeling
a little queasy. [ sighs ]

150
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,030
I hate this feeling.

151
00:05:08,064 --> 00:05:10,632
I hate it, and it's just
gonna get worse and worse

152
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,700
Until the flight.

153
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:12,668
Hey.

154
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,903
It's gonna be fine.

155
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:16,938
Uncle Phil's here.

156
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:20,141
Great job, buddy!
First one ready!

157
00:05:20,175 --> 00:05:22,611
Haley and Alex, let's go!

158
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:23,945
Bless you.

159
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,513
Coming.

160
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,515
All right, come on, girls.
Okay.

161
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,350
Okay, this is why we practice.

162
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,151
Come on through.
Come through. 15 seconds.

163
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:32,419
Are we ready?

164
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:33,754
I think so.
Yeah.

165
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,188
It's go time!
Go.

166
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:37,357
All right.
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

167
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,026
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
Straight to the car. Straight through.

168
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,227
Very nice!
All right, let's go, let's go.

169
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:44,562
Hey. I think we got
an extra couple of seconds.

170
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:46,197
No, we don't.
Dad, come on.

171
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:49,366
<i>Row 30
may now board at gate one.</i>

172
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,833
Mmm. [ smooches ]

173
00:05:50,867 --> 00:05:53,202
I will never g tired of this.

174
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,737
Me neither.

175
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,871
You know what would be cool, mom?

176
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:58,072
What's that?

177
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,540
If the plane flew into a storm

178
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:03,043
And crash-landed onto an island
like in Lost"!

179
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,681
Ow. Ow.

180
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:10,915
Ow.

181
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,316
Something wrong there, Cam?

182
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:14,817
Oh, well, I'm just breaking in
a new pair of hiking shoes.

183
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:15,917
This always happens.

184
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:17,385
All the men in my family
have wide ankles.

185
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,253
I have an Uncle that
can only wear bell bottoms.

186
00:06:19,288 --> 00:06:20,254
Hand to God.

187
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,489
I wasn't doubting you.

188
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,590
Just, why are you wearing
the hiking shoes?

189
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:24,924
Surprise!

190
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,792
<i>What, again?</i>

191
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,027
Every morning, thole family
is gonna go hiking.

192
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:30,629
And then,
at the end of the week,

193
00:06:30,663 --> 00:06:32,730
We all gonna make it to the top
of the volcano!

194
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,566
Every morning, huh?
 yes.

195
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,833
When Cam suggested it,

196
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,567
<i>I knew you were
gonna love it, baby.</i>

197
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:39,169
<i>Oh, so this
was your idea?</i>

198
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:40,236
Happy Birthday, Jay.

199
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,938
Aw, thanks, buddy.
Ow.

200
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,673
Hi, sweetheart.

201
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:46,074
She's smiling.
Yes, I'm going hiking!

202
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.

203
00:06:52,395 --> 00:06:54,462
Thank you.

204
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,030
Look, mom, I'm pregnant.

205
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,498
Yeah. You still got to take
your Dramamine.

206
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,233
Oh, does somebody get
a little motion sickness?

207
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,169
<i>Yeah,
I throw up all the time.</i>

208
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,137
Oh, well, then Dramamine's
the way to go.

209
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:06,204
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,738
Oh, I'm just trying
to keep her awake

211
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:08,940
So she'll sleep on the plane.

212
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,739
Nobody likes a crying baby
on a flight.

213
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:12,506
It's -- it's very stressful.

214
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,339
Yeah, uh, last year,
I flew back from New York

215
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,775
<i>Next to a baby who was
very upset the entire flight.</i>

216
00:07:18,277 --> 00:07:20,909
I was on that flight with you,
and I don't recall --

217
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,577
<i>Oh, I get it.
You're talking about me.</i>

218
00:07:22,644 --> 00:07:23,744
That's very funny.

219
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,445
Yeah, we couldn't get tickets
to "billy Elliot."

220
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,313
all he wanted to do was dance.

221
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:28,481
<i>And that's my story.</i>

222
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,915
Yeah, five hours of this.

223
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,184
I just want
to dance at the ballet!

224
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,724
Dramamine --
oh, I wish I had that

225
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,025
The last time I flew.

226
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,427
I'll tell you, the plane
was rocking up and down,

227
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:43,628
Back and forth.

228
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:45,496
I thought the wings
were gonna snap off, honestly.

229
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,831
Okay, you do it yourself.
Use your teeth.

230
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:52,768
I-is this the best way to go?
What about the freeway?

231
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,436
Relax, Pumpkin, I got this.

232
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,604
It's all about
knowing the route.

233
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,008
You're talking to a guy
who made his way through college

234
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,142
By driving a pedicab.

235
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:01,843
You know what one of those is?

236
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:04,378
Yes, yes.
I just saw one pass us.

237
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:06,547
Quick, who sang "Evilan"?

238
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:07,548
What?

239
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:08,749
E.L.O.

240
00:08:08,783 --> 00:08:10,150
Phil, where the hell are you?

241
00:08:10,184 --> 00:08:11,517
Uh...Let's see.

242
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,986
Oh, shoot,
I just missed my turn.

243
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,987
<i>You're supposed to be here
with me.</i>

244
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:17,855
I told you,
I get more and more freaked out

245
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,189
As we get closer to the flight!

246
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:20,658
Well,
I know, but Mitch --

247
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:21,959
I was counting on you

248
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:24,161
To be here, so, thanks...

249
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:25,361
A lot.

250
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,633
She's pretty tightly wound.

251
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,935
Some people are just built
that way.

252
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,171
Honestly,
could you drive any slower?!

253
00:08:37,205 --> 00:08:40,240
Guess where the world's largest
wind generator is.

254
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:42,376
Is it right behind me?

255
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,245
Nope.
It's on the island of Oahu.

256
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,947
I'm thinking about using it
in my song about Hawaii.

257
00:08:46,982 --> 00:08:47,815
What song?

258
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,015
Didn't mom tell yo

259
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,350
Surprise!

260
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:52,786
The whole family's
putting on a show for you

261
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,987
For your birthday.

262
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,723
Everybody's performing!
Even Phil brought his dummy!

263
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,492
Isn't that great?

264
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:00,261
Jay?

265
00:09:00,295 --> 00:09:01,896
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was just thinking

266
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,131
How tragic it would be
if I fell into that volcano.

267
00:09:04,165 --> 00:09:05,432
Ay, papi, don't say that.

268
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,035
Ow. Ow. Ow.

269
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:11,204
Not yet, sweetie.
Not yet.

270
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,442
See, he's perfect.

271
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:16,776
Look at him getting coffee

272
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,244
And not putting chocolate
in it.

273
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,412
He's so mature.

274
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:21,145
What about Dylan?

275
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,545
<i>Dylan's no that guy.</i>

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,047
Haley! Come on!
We're leaving in two minutes!

277
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:28,080
Get up!

278
00:09:30,382 --> 00:09:31,349
Oh, my God!

279
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,084
Oh, no.
Is it tomorrow?

280
00:09:33,118 --> 00:09:34,719
Dylan,
what are you doing here?!

281
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:36,654
I was gonna go,
but then you fell asleep,

282
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,456
And since you're leaving
for a week,

283
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,591
I wanted to stare at you
as long as I could.

284
00:09:40,625 --> 00:09:41,558
<i>You have to go.</i>

285
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:42,959
My parents are gonna think
we did it!

286
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,360
As if.

287
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,726
Okay, get out of the house,

288
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:47,995
And make sure
that nobody sees you!

289
00:09:49,164 --> 00:09:50,364
I'll miss you.

290
00:09:50,398 --> 00:09:52,167
When you're gone,
it's like I'm this prisoner

291
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:53,501
Trapped in a cell
of loneliness.

292
00:09:53,535 --> 00:09:54,968
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

293
00:09:55,003 --> 00:09:56,069
That's beautiful,
but you have to go.

294
00:09:56,103 --> 00:09:57,270
Okay, uh...

295
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:05,810
I hate this feeling.

296
00:10:05,877 --> 00:10:08,045
I hate it, and it's just
gonna get worse and worse

297
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,246
Until the flight.

298
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,514
Hey.
It's gonna be fine.

299
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:12,483
Mm.

300
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:14,718
Uncle Phil's here.

301
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:16,352
Great job, buddy!
First one ready!

302
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:17,654
Thanks.

303
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:19,389
- Haley and Alex, let's go!
- Coming!

304
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:21,456
Bless you.

305
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,324
Coming.

306
00:10:23,358 --> 00:10:25,258
All right, come on, girls.
Okay.

307
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,459
Okay, this is why we practice.

308
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,193
Come on through.
Come through. 15 seconds.

309
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,428
Are we ready?

310
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,762
Yes.
Yes. Yes.

311
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,697
It's go time!
Go.

312
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:35,130
All right.
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

313
00:10:35,165 --> 00:10:37,532
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.
Straight to the car. Straight through.

314
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,534
Very nice!
All right, let's go, let's go.

315
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:42,869
Hey. I think we got
an extra couple of seconds.

316
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,136
No, we don't.
Dad, come on.

317
00:11:01,887 --> 00:11:03,154
Oh, no!

318
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:05,489
What?!
My keys!

319
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,026
Stay awake, sweetie.
 stay awake.

320
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,728
Whee...

321
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,198
Oh, no.

322
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:16,003
This is where your Realtor
training comes in handy.

323
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:19,472
Looks like a standard
Porter & sons d-model top-lock.

324
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:22,544
One quick swipe
ought to pop it.

325
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:24,813
All aboard.

326
00:11:24,848 --> 00:11:26,382
Okay.

327
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,416
There we go.

328
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,751
All right.
Nice and easy.

329
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:29,785
Oh, whoa. Okay.
Yeah.

330
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,986
You're pinching.
You're pinching.

331
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,354
Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:35,853
If you show enough houses,
you learn all the tricks.

333
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:38,754
Every Realtor is just a ninja
in a blazer.

334
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,858
The average burglar breaks in
and leaves clues everywhere,

335
00:11:42,892 --> 00:11:44,626
But not me.

336
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,595
I'm completely clueless.

337
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,697
Sure I'm not too heavy?

338
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,199
Please, you weigh less
than my paintball gear.

339
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,467
Oh, okay.
There we go.

340
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:54,801
We are in.
Yep.

341
00:11:54,836 --> 00:11:56,236
Off-load.
There we go.

342
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,970
Squeezing.
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.

343
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,138
I'm going for a ride.
 okay.

344
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,306
Ha ha.
You all right?

345
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,974
Yep.
I'm good. I'm good.

346
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,541
What are you doing?

347
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:06,710
Just making it a little tougher
on the next guy.

348
00:12:06,745 --> 00:12:08,545
You got to get up
pretty early -- son of a --

349
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,713
Oh, God!
Are you all right?

350
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:10,914
Yeah, I am.
Oh, oh...

351
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,350
Just, uh, almost killed myself
on your fire truck.

352
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,785
That's not ours.
That's, uh, Jasper's.

353
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,052
You know Jasper?
 yeah.

354
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,219
I sold a house to his parents.

355
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,720
How did you ever get
a playdate with him?

356
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:19,721
Let's go!
Okay.

357
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,156
Please-- Cam -- yeah.

358
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,126
Look at him.
He's sketching!

359
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,895
He's like Leonardo DiCaprio
in "titanic."

360
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,197
I bet he goes to art school.

361
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,366
<i>Do you think
he's sketching us?</i>

362
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,034
Yeah.

363
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,036
"us."

364
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,873
<i>...5:35 to Boston
may board at this time.</i>

365
00:12:38,907 --> 00:12:41,175
And contact.

366
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:47,045
Ugh.
It's Dylan.

367
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,279
"I'm trapped."

368
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What a drama queen.

369
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,550
We will go whale "washing,"

370
00:12:56,585 --> 00:12:59,686
Explore the tropical forest,
get back into the nature.

371
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,253
That sounds fun.
Mm-hmm.

372
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,255
Thanks.
Thank you.

373
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,756
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

374
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,391
<i>Would Manny Delgado
please report to gate 22a?</i>

375
00:13:08,425 --> 00:13:11,860
<i>Manny Delgado to gate 22a.</i>

376
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:14,562
Check it out, grandpa.
The Dramamine's working.

377
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:15,830
I'm not dizzy!

378
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:18,266
Yeah.
Oh, watch the drink, kid.

379
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,334
Ooh!
Ooh, my Ludlums!

380
00:13:20,369 --> 00:13:21,703
I-I'm sorry, grandpa.

381
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:24,673
All right, relax, relax.
We might be okay here.

382
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:30,080
It's not fair.

383
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,815
It's not fair.

384
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,718
Excuse me, ma'am.

385
00:13:35,752 --> 00:13:37,552
Is this Manny Delgado?
Yes.

386
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:38,919
Your son's name
is on a no-fly list.

387
00:13:38,954 --> 00:13:41,155
Ay, please, we've been
through this at the check-in.

388
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,690
He's not the same
Manny Delgado.

389
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,993
I'm just a boy trying to bring
style back to travel.

390
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,528
We just have a few questions
to ask.

391
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:48,430
No, this is a mistake.
Where is my husband? Wait.

392
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:49,764
Step this way, ma'am.
Jay! Ma'am.

393
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,999
Ma'am, step this way, please?
Jay!

394
00:13:51,034 --> 00:13:52,334
Son? No pushing!
Step this way.

395
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:53,369
Jay!!

396
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,973
Could you make it a double? I'.

397
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,474
No problem.

398
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:09,788
Yeah, life would be simpler
if I was gay.

399
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,622
Do you think you could get
in the fast lane?

400
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,157
<i>Oh, I could totally
get in the fast lane.</i>

401
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:14,691
I mean the road.

402
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,495
Ooh, I'm getting a text.
What does it say?

403
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,764
Um [sighs]

404
00:14:18,798 --> 00:14:20,065
Oh, g--
well, it's nothing.

405
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,199
It's the alarm company.

406
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:22,868
Its says your --
your house was broken into.

407
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,104
What?! It's nothing.
They'll take care of it. Just drive!!

408
00:14:25,138 --> 00:14:26,138
What happened?!

409
00:14:31,512 --> 00:14:33,880
Okay, fun airport game.
Mm-hmm.

410
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,315
All right, you pick out a traveler...
Mm.

411
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,784
...You come up
with their entire story.

412
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:38,218
Okay, this guy,
his name's Henry.

413
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,289
He's on his way to Phoenix
to visit his grandmother,

414
00:14:40,323 --> 00:14:42,124
Whose name is, uh...

415
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,893
Unh! Pass. Too hard.
Your turn.

416
00:14:44,927 --> 00:14:45,894
Okay, fine.

417
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,361
I see a woman,
uh, wracked with fear,

418
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:49,028
Whose husband
has abandoned her.

419
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:50,263
Where? Where?
Who is she?

420
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:51,497
Me.

421
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:52,597
I made it perfectly clear
to Phil

422
00:14:52,631 --> 00:14:53,597
<i>That I needed him here.</i>

423
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:54,831
It's going around.

424
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,199
Mitchell's mad at me, too.

425
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:58,002
He thinks because I didn't
help him pack this morning,

426
00:14:58,036 --> 00:14:59,069
He forgot his wallet.

427
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:01,271
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to be snippy.

428
00:15:01,306 --> 00:15:02,572
It's just [sighs]

429
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,473
I'm a little upset with Cam.

430
00:15:04,507 --> 00:15:05,806
I needed his help this morning,

431
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:07,174
And, you know, he let me down.

432
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,742
That doesn't sound like him.

433
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:11,210
You asked him to do something
and he didn't do it?

434
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,844
But he never asked!

435
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,178
I mean, all he said was,

436
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,613
"Lily's bag needs to be packed,

437
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:17,414
And the newspaper
needs to be canceled."

438
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,550
<i>That sounds to me
like he was asking for help.</i>

439
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:22,852
Sounds to me like you expected
him to read your mind.

440
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,053
What am I, a psychic?

441
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:25,721
No, it's not about
reading minds.

442
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,822
It's about knowing
what your partner needs.

443
00:15:27,856 --> 00:15:29,625
Here's an idea.
Just say, "help me."

444
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:31,761
You don't even have to say "me."
just "help."

445
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:33,596
Then he'll know
exactly what you want.

446
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,164
You won't have to get all mad.

447
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:36,966
I'm not mad.
It's just...

448
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,500
You know, you want to believe

449
00:15:38,535 --> 00:15:40,335
That you're on the same
wavelength as someone,

450
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,270
And then it's just --

451
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:44,639
It's a little disheartening
when you find out you're not.

452
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:46,974
That's all.

453
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:49,743
What's frustrating is I would do
anything for Mitchell,

454
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:51,512
And -- and, frankly,
it's a little hurtful

455
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,713
That he doesn't know that.

456
00:15:55,717 --> 00:15:58,818
So...Airports, huh?

457
00:15:58,853 --> 00:16:00,253
Yeah.

458
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:02,688
Are you drawing
something there?

459
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,190
Eh, it's no good.

460
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,825
Tortured artist.

461
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,361
Classic.

462
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:10,830
Oh. Yeah.

463
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:12,599
It's a robot!

464
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,501
Oh, yeah, sure is.

465
00:16:14,536 --> 00:16:15,770
What's behind him?

466
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:16,904
A dinosaur.

467
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,039
It's for school.

468
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,807
We're supposed to
make a comic strip.

469
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:22,209
We had to do that, too,
back in the eighth...

470
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,882
He was 14 years old!

471
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,550
Shut up.

472
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:31,252
"he's my soul mate."

473
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:33,789
I...

474
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,931
<i>This is the final
boarding announcement for...</i>

475
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:48,736
Whatcha drinking?

476
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,405
Dad.

477
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,872
Hey.

478
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:54,906
Mostly tonic, actually,
thanks to my new sponsor here.

479
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,208
I'm a little jittery
about flying.

480
00:16:58,242 --> 00:17:00,541
What are you talking about?
You fly all the time.

481
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:01,675
Yeah. I know.

482
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,242
This started just
in the last couple years.

483
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:04,843
I think I'm just --

484
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:07,279
I'm nervous 'cause I've got
so much to lose now, you know?

485
00:17:07,313 --> 00:17:08,313
What about you?

486
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:10,048
I'm taking a break
from my vacation.

487
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:12,083
We haven't even started yet.

488
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,217
Well, I t to figure

489
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,651
I might not have a lot
of time for myself,

490
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:15,952
You know, what with the luaus,
the hiking,

491
00:17:15,986 --> 00:17:17,086
The talent shows.

492
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:19,322
Are you not happy
that we're coming with you?

493
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,923
It's just not what I expected.

494
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,791
But, dad...

495
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,726
Doesn't it feel good to know

496
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,528
That your whole family
is willing to drop everything

497
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:28,996
To be with you,

498
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,531
To fly across the ocean
in a steel coffin?

499
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:33,299
I'm gonna finish that.

500
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,067
It's not you guys.
I love the family.

501
00:17:35,101 --> 00:17:36,468
Mm-hmm.

502
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:39,903
It just kinda feels like
glia's going out of her way

503
00:17:39,938 --> 00:17:41,805
<i>Not to spend time
with me.</i>

504
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:44,907
You don't believe that, do you?

505
00:17:44,941 --> 00:17:47,276
Oh, come on, dad.

506
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,545
That is so crazy
and so adorable.

507
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,015
That woman loves you.

508
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:57,284
Well, I didn't say
I wasn't lovable.

509
00:17:58,486 --> 00:18:00,920
It's not every wife
that would spend the money

510
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,854
To fly a family to Hawaii.

511
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:06,890
Okay, where does everybody
think Gloria's money comes from?

512
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:13,264
So, what kind of business
did you have in Japan?

513
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:14,999
I've never been to Japan.

514
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:16,834
You didn't go to Osaka
in November 2003

515
00:18:18,637 --> 00:18:21,038
I was 4.
Enough.

516
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,239
Why don't you question the
other people in the gate, huh?

517
00:18:23,274 --> 00:18:24,841
Did you see the old lady
with the cane?

518
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,509
What if she has
a ceramic knife in there

519
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,110
That can go through
the metal detector?

520
00:18:28,144 --> 00:18:30,945
And yet you waste your time
harassing a little kid!

521
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:32,679
Ma'am, you seem to know
an awful lot

522
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:35,315
About sneaking contraband
onto a plane.

523
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:37,016
Yeah, I'm Colombian.

524
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,184
Have you ever been to Japan?

525
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,584
I would like to make
a phone call.

526
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:42,619
Ladies and gentlemen,

527
00:18:42,653 --> 00:18:44,086
Pre-boarding
for our flight to Maui

528
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:45,587
Will begin
in the next few minutes.

529
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,389
Luke, please stop spinning.

530
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,490
Sorry.

531
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:50,726
Now make the airport
stop spinning.

532
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,995
We made it!

533
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,830
Cameron, oh, boy.
Claire!

534
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:55,499
Oh, my God,
thank God you're here!

535
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:56,867
Hi!
Oh, honey.

536
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,202
Mwah!
I am so sorry.

537
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,403
It was my fault.

538
00:18:59,437 --> 00:19:00,470
It wasn't your fault.

539
00:19:00,505 --> 00:19:01,705
I should have known
what you wanted.

540
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:04,141
Are you drunk?

541
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,176
Kinda.

542
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,179
And once I spent a week
in Cancún,

543
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,782
Which, by the way,
did not live up to the hype.

544
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,582
[ door opens

545
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,884
Can somebody tell me
what the hell is going on?

546
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,686
We're almost done here, sir.

547
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,055
So you and your son are
traveling together. Yes.

548
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,358
Then why are you departing Maui
on different dates?

549
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:25,792
Well, because...

550
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:28,728
He's traveling back home
with his family.

551
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:30,362
What?

552
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:31,830
Surprise!

553
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:33,198
They're only staying
for six days.

554
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,866
The rest of the time,
it's only you and me.

555
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:35,867
Really?

556
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,168
Mm-hmm.

557
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:39,070
I wanted to spend some time
alone with my husband,

558
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:41,171
Drink cocktails by the pool,

559
00:19:41,206 --> 00:19:43,941
Sleep in. Mm.

560
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:47,477
I could not love you any more
than I do right now.

561
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:50,312
I also found a topless beach.

562
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,779
I was wrong.

563

564
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,776
Mr. Jackson,
have a great flight.

565
00:19:58,811 --> 00:19:59,811
It's to the left.

566
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:00,846
Oh, gorgeous.

567
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,214
Oh, thank you.
It's vintage.

568
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,015
I think he meant Lily.
You don't know that.

569
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,118
Yo, there's another
hottie for you at 5:00.

570
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,721
It's whale "watching."

571
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:12,356
Whale "washing."

572
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:14,926
"watching." "watching."

573
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,327
It's close enough.
Hi, sir.

574
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:17,528
Have a good flight, sir.

575
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,329
Quick,
do your zombie impression.

576
00:20:19,364 --> 00:20:20,730
Oh, she hasn't been drinking,
has she?

577
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:22,632
Oh, no, no, no.
She's -- s's hario.

578
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:24,467
Okay, let's do
"bride of Frankenstein."

579
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,502
Oh!

580
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:29,171
That is so -- so good.
