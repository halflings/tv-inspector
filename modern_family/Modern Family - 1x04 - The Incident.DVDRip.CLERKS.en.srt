00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:07,591
Jay, I'm home.

2
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:10,427
Did Manny call?
No, because he's fine.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,054
It was a slumber party,
not a gang fight.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,765
I just want him
to fit in.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,393
I'm gonna take a shower.
Do you care to join me?

6
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,354
You know, honey, there's a gun
in the footlocker in the garage.

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,649
If I ever say no to that question,
I want you to use it on me.

[Haley Chanting]
Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack.

10
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:30,655
All dressed in black,
black, black.
Shh, shh.

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,949
[Whispers] What's wrong?
With silver buttons,
buttons, buttons.

12
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,452
All down her back,
back, back.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,038
Why aren't they trying
to hurt each other?

14
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,290
I don't know,
but I'm afraid to move.

15
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,501
[Laughing]
You're really good at this.
Thanks.

16
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,171
What is happening,
Claire?

17
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,089
[Cameron] Mmm!
[Mitchell]
What do you think?

18
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:50,091
Now, that is a scone.

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,427
No butter. Nonfat.

20
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:54,721
Shut up.
[Doorbell Rings]

21
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:56,806
I'm gonna
go check on Lily.

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,064

[Thud, Wings Fluttering]

24
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,070
What's that?
Sounds like a bird
hit the window.

25
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:12,572
Oh, God.
That's a bad sign.

26
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:15,242
Ow! That hurt, jerk!

00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,661

Ow! I'm gonna kill you,
stupid!

Ow!
Ow!

29
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,249
What happened?
Now I'm sad.

30
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,709
Hi, honey. Mmm!
Hi. I, uh-

31
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,170
I- I didn't know
you were in town.
You didn't call.

32
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:31,091
Well, I couldn't wait
to see your new baby.
Where is she?

33
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,260
Mitchell, who was that?
It's my mom.

34
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:35,845
Oh, yeah, right, 'cause
the last time she was here,

35
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,889
the refrigerator magnets
rearranged themselves...

36
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:41,017
into a penta- Grandma!

Mom. Mom, what are you
doing to her legs?

42
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,162
Tai chi. I did it
every day in Sedona.

43
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:02,914
Cameron, you should try it.

44

[Chuckles]

45
00:02:05,418 --> 00:02:09,129
Mitchell's mother
has a problem... with me.

46
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,131
Last Christmas, for example,

47
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:14,801
she gave me a piece
of exercise equipment
and a lettuce dryer.

48
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:16,553
So, to recap,

49
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,680
I gave her a gorgeous pair
of diamond earrings,

50
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,850
and she gave me a hint.

51
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,937
And living in Sedona
has been transformational.

52
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:29,482
I get up every morning,
and I go to a Vortex
meditation site...

53
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:34,863
and work with a shaman
to finally understand how
to live my spirituality.

54
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:36,448
Yikes.

55
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,243
And I've learned that
the only way I can move...

56
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:42,996
to the next level
of my awakening...

57
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,999
is if we all can somehow...

58
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,918
get past... the incident.

59
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,628
Oh, no.

60
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,382
- The incident.
- Oh, boy.

61
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,927
I would like to congratulate
Jay and the lovely Gloria.

62
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,263
I'm very happy for them.

63
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,766
I wanted a big, beautiful
wedding with Jay...

64
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,851
because my ex-husband and I
got married...

65
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,063
in a tiny little office
of a judge in Colombia.

66
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,108
My mother wanted to go
to the wedding to show everyone
how okay she was with all of it,

67
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:15,570
so I convinced Dad and Gloria
to invite her.

68
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,324
Who warned you that that
was the worst idea ever?

69
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,785
Anyone? Anyone?

Oh.

Of course,
I've-I've moved on.
[Chuckling]

72

I was supposed to
come with a date,
but he just hurt his back,

73
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,671
which is very ironic
because he's young
and-and healthy.

74
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:35,507
My mom started drinking...

75
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,093
these cocktails called
"Horny Colombians"...

76
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,096
with some
of Gloria's uncles,

77
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,099

was named after.

Yeah.

Uh, it was really funny.

Then it was gross.

To the bride
and the groom- my ex.

Thirty-five years
we were together,

to run off with Charo.

- Seriously, I knew they were
perfect for each other...

a little fresh air, okay?
No, no.

I'm Gloria! I'm Gloria!
I got her.

Ayayayayay!
Ooh! Ayayayayay!

[Shouts]
[Guests Gasping]

105
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,549
During my vows to my first
husband, drug dealers burst in
and assassinated the judge.

106
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,802
This was way worse.
What can I say?
I drive women crazy.

- Everybody is going
to be there, Mom!
- I don't care.

Your father and I are not about
to let you drive two hours
to go to a concert...

111
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,983
and then spend the night
with a bunch of boys,

112
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,027
especially that 17-year-old
hormone you're dating.

113
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,946
- It's totally supervised.
- Oh, really? By whom?

114
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,741
- By Spencer Patine's uncle.
- Who's Spencer Patine?

115
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,784
You know Spencer-
the guy with the arm.

116
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,163
Wait. What kind of arm?
What does that even mean?
His uncle is Uncle Toby.

117
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,082
Oh, Uncle Toby.
I'll be sure to include that
in my Amber Alert.

118
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:36,586
Oh, my God!
Okay. Can I step in here?
I think I can help.

119
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,588
Haley, what your mom
is worried about...

120
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,925
is you getting your heart broken
when Dylan goes off
to college next year.

121
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,053
He's not going to college.
That's not what I'm-
He's not going to college?

122
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,514
He's in a band, okay?
They're going on tour.

123
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,599
Oh, this just gets
better and better.

124
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,435
Why are you always on me
about everything?

125
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,854
Because you need
to understand-
Okay. Everybody, calm down!

126
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,814
Let's start from the beginning.

127
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,609
What's wrong
with Spencer's arm?
[Grunts]

128
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,115
Mom, I'm home!

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,327
Ay, baby! Did you have fun
at the slumber party?

130
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,413
You must be exhausted.
No, I'm not tired at all.

131
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,124
I was the first one
to fall asleep.

132
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:19,379
What's on your face?
A smile from having such
a good time with my friends.

133
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:22,090
No. Come here.

134
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:27,220
Look.
Oh.

135
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,264
That's why they were laughing.

136
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,141
I thought it was my funny take
on current events.

137
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:35,186
Why would they do
something like that?
Don't worry about it.

138
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,856
Guys pull pranks like that all the time.
You just gotta prank 'em back.

139
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,193
You just gotta show 'em
you're willing to give
as good as you get.

140
00:06:43,404 --> 00:06:46,864
What do you think?
Hmm.

141
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,075
Revenge.

142
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,119
I like it.

143
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,834
Well, Mom, instead of dredging up
the whole incident,

144
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,837
maybe we should just try and repress it,
like a- like a normal family.

145
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,756
I can't.
I need closure.

146
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,843
I'm about to embark
on a new journey.

147
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,220
- I met a man.
- Really?

148
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:14,309
His name is Chas, and he's
asked me to come live with him
in his foreign land.

149
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,603
- Wow. Where?
- Canada.

150
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,647
- You're moving to-to Canada?
- French Canada.

151
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,151
Oh.
Oh. Oh.
That's wonderful.

152
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,280
It is wonderful.
It's just that when I think
of all the awful things...

153
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:33,161
that I said to Gloria
and Jay and you and Claire,
I feel such guilt.

154
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,371
Give it time,
and see Banff.

155
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,373
Cam, please.

156
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:41,377
I just can't give myself
to him sexually.

157
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,463
Okay. Mom.
Did not see that coming.

158
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh, oh. Don't get me wrong.
We satisfy each other
down there-

159
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,010
Oh!
Can't-
Don't wanna-

160
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:53,056
That's why I need
everyone's forgiveness.
I need your help, Mitchell.

161
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,976
Did you hear that, Mitchell?
Your mom needs your help to
make love to her new man, Chas.

162
00:07:57,061 --> 00:07:58,978
That's not weird at all.

163
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:03,149
Mom, I- [Chuckles]
I'm just not really sure what
you're asking me to do, Mom.

164
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,569
Well, everyone's mad at me.
Oh-

165
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:09,572
Maybe you could pave the way
so that I can apologize.

166
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,784
Well, um, you know,

167
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,119
we are actually
all supposed to have
Sunday dinner tonight,

168
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,373
so maybe I could go around
and ask everyone if it's okay
for you to join us.

169
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:21,751
Oh! I knew
I could count on you.

170
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,711
Oh, my beautiful boy.
Mmm.

171
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:25,463
I love you so much.

172
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:29,676
There's a fish in nature that
swims around with its babies
in its mouth.

173
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,220
That fish would look
at Mitchell's relationship
with his mother...

174
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,263
and say, "That's messed up."

175
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:41,020
Hey.
Hey.

176
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,774
Boy-
[Clears Throat]

177
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,361
Things with your mom
got pretty intense
down there, huh?

178
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,531
All like
East Coast-West Coast.
You feelin' me?

179
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,991
Act like a parent,
talk like a peer.

180
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,035
I call it "peerenting."

181
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,955
I learned it from my own dad,
who used to walk into my room...

182
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,499
and say,
"What's up, Sweathog?"

183
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:05,128
Honey, I would love to
let you go to the concert.

184
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,714
Are you kidding me?
I think concerts are rad.

185
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,299
- Hello? I was a Hall-Raiser.
- A what?

186
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,885
I followed Hall & Oates
around the country one summer.

187
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,221
"Rich Girl"
just spoke to me.

188
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,015
I was dating this girl.
Not- Not dating.

189
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,393
I guess I was
following her too, kind of-

190
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,312
Okay, Mom just doesn't trust me,
and it's not fair.

191
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:26,691
She trusts you.
It's just that weird stuff
happens at concerts.

192
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,026
- Boys get urges.
- Ew.

193
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,070
Dad, is there
something you want?

194
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,656
Yes, there is- to connect
with this girl right here.

195
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,658
Now, come on.
Pretend I'm not your dad.

196
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,035
We're just a couple
of friends kickin' it
in a juice bar.

197
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,913
- What's a juice bar?
- Okay, a malt shop. Whatever.

198
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,790
Dad, I don't-
No. Who's Dad?

199
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,085
Who's Dad?
I'm- I'm Marcus from Biology.

200
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,755
Hey, Haley. How's it going
with you and Dylan?

201
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,759
Has he tried anything
inappropriate with you? Girl.

202
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,927
[Ringing]
Hey.

203
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,971
[Girl]
What are you doing?
Nothing.

204
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,516
Just talking to some dork
I met in a malt shop.

205
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,977
[Doorbell Rings]

206
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,522
Hey, Mitchell. What's up?
Hey! Just in the hood.

207
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:10,485
Do you- Do you remember
how Mom gave up a career
to raise us?

208
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,487
Promising career.

209
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,655
Oh, God.
Claire?

210
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,365
Mom.

211
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,785
Why so long?

212
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,163
I know, I know.
It's weird when we haven't
talked for a while.

213
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,749
I mean your hair.
Mmm. Mmm.

214
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,293
Well, if I can't
tell you, who will?
[Mouthing Words]

215
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:31,756
So, Mom wants you to know
that she's very sorry
about the incident,

216
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,509
and-and she wants us
to forgive her.

217
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,804
How very nice of her
to say that through you.

218
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:43,059
Do you see?
The sarcasm is so hurtful,
like a whip.

219
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:45,937
You know how growing up,
we all have that voice
inside our head...

220
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,898
that tells us
we're not good enough?

221
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,609
Well, mine was outside my head,
driving me to school.

222
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,030
Uh, so- so anyway, Mom really
wants to smooth everything over
with Dad and Gloria.

223
00:10:56,114 --> 00:11:01,077
So I was thinking, uh, would it
be okay if she maybe joined us
for dinner tonight?

224
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,663
Because it may be
the last time
you ever see me.

225
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:07,083
Well-
Okay. Wait, Mom.
What are you talking about?

226
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,044
Well, I'm- I'm moving...

227
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,922
to a far
and dangerous place.

228
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,050
Canada. But, uh, she met
a man named Chas.

229
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,094
Yeah.
He's a logger.

230
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,596
Uh, like a lumberjack?

231
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:23,850
No, he logs blood samples
into a cholesterol study.

232
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:28,896
Anyway, until I'm past
this whole wedding debacle,
I can't be intimate with him.

233
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,482
Oh.
We do things
to each other.

234
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:34,068
We use our hands.
Oh, my Lord.

235
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,363
Hey, Nana.
Oh, my little comet!

236
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:40,157
Hi.
Oh, look at you.
You're all grown up.

237
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,953
Hmm. Tell Mom that.
She won't even let me
go to a concert.

238
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,498
Overnight,
with her boyfriend.
[Laughing]

239
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,585
What are you
laughing at?

240
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,214
Oh, karma's
a funny thing, that's all.

241
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,425
- Remember Ricky?
- Oh, God.

242
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,927
Ooh. Who's Ricky?
[Claire]
No one.

243
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:02,179
Ricky was your mother's
boyfriend,

244
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,265
and he looked
like Charles Manson.

245
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,768
And one night,
she didn't come home
until 4:00 in the morning.

246
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:11,981
4:00. Wow. Wow.
Mom, what were you
and Ricky doing?

247
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,026
Nothing. We were doing nothing,
and he was a very sweet boy,

248
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,778
which you might have known
if you bothered
to get to know him.

249
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,197
- Dylan's a sweet boy.
- [Scoffs]

250
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,743
Dylan. Dylan isn't Ricky.
Ricky- Ricky was a poet.

251
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,913
Dylan writes songs.
Awesome songs.

252
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:29,874
And maybe you would know that
"if you bothered to get to know him."

253
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,252
Ha!
[Laughing]

254
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,047
Okay, you know?
First of all,
I am not my mother.

255
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:40,092
I don't judge people before
I get a chance to know them.

256
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:43,512
So you invite Dylan over
to dinner tonight,

257
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,933
and if he's as sweet
and as kind as you say he is,

258
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:52,146
then I have no problem
considering letting you
go to the concert,

259
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,315
after I do
a background check
on Uncle Toby.

260
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,442
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Mom.

261
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,527
I'm gonna go call him!

262
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:04,283
That's very revealing.
That's my parenting style.

263
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:07,370
- No, I meant your blouse.
- Mom!

264
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,539
Claire, wait. Come-
Not making this easy.

265
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,751
Claire, come on.
Stop, stop, stop.

266
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,963
Just let her come to dinner,
apologize to Dad and Gloria,

267
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,924
and she and Chas can live
happily ever after.

268
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,343
In Canada.
In Canada.

269
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,305
Wait. Why don't you make her
fix this, instead of you
doing it as usual?

270
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,307
Whoa. What's that
supposed to mean?

271
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:30,685
Mom makes a mess,
and there's Mitchell
to clean it up.

272
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,687
That is so not true.

273
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,898
If anything, you're
the one with the screwed-up
relationship with Mommy-

274
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,900
With Mom.
Wow. "Mommy"!

275
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,445
No, I didn't say it-
Damn it.
Ooh. Fine. Fine.

276
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,115
She can come, but she's
gotta clear it with Daddy.
"Daddy"?

277
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,367
I did not say "Daddy."
You said "Daddy."

278
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:54,291
Hey, Dad.
Mitchell, what are you
doing here?

279
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:57,628
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.
Can I talk to you and Gloria
for a second?

280
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,672
She's out dealing
with a Manny situation.

281
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,717
- He set a kid's bike on fire.
- Why?

282
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,177
Oh, I might have told him
to get even with some kids,

283
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,597
and he went all Rambo with it.
[Shouts]

284
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,391
Not my best parenting moment.

285
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,352
[Chuckling]
Not your worst.
What's up?

286
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,814
Uh, well, you know,
uh, Mom's in town.
Your mom?

287
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,525
No, your mom.
She's back from the grave.
Yes. Yes, my mom, Dad.

288
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,861
My mom would be less scary.

289
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,071
Listen, she's a wreck about
what happened at the wedding,

290
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:26,657
and she wants
to come to dinner tonight
to apologize to everyone.

291
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:28,784
Still her little errand boy,
I see.

292
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,412
No- Why does everybody
keep saying- No.

293
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,541
I- I'm just trying
to piece this family
back together.

294
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,752
So, you'll talk to Gloria
about Mom coming to dinner?

295
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,920
Oh, Gloria
would never go for that
in a million years.

296
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,174
She's still furious with
your mother, which is why
I'm not talking to you.

297
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,926
What did I do?
This conversation
never took place.

298
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,554
That's not very nice.
I drove all the way here.
You were never here.

299
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,558
- You never even called.
- I would've called, but I
thought it would be better-

300
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,643
What's happening here?

301
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,856
Listen, I would love to
get this thing behind us,

302
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,901
but Gloria would never
forgive me if I pulled
a fast one on her.

303
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,237
That's why you're going to
pull a fast one on her,

304
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:07,323
and I'm not going to
like it one bit.

305
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,825
Okay, that's just great.
No, that's great.
So, it's all up to me.

306
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,828
I can't hear you
because you're back home,
and I'm taking a nap.

307
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,122
[Sighs]

308
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,166
[Doorbell Rings]

309
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,128
D-Money! There he is.
Hey.

310
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:22,880
Come on in.
Hey.

311
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,590
Hi.
How you doing?

312
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,967
Good. Um-
Uh, hey, everybody.

313
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,220
This is Dylan.
Hey.

314
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,347
Hi, Dylan.
Hey.

315
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,809
He has
a very gentle soul.

316
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,103
You got that from "Hey"?

317
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,146
So, Dylan, see you
brought the ax.

318
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,607
Yeah, yeah.
I just came from practice.
Sweet.

319
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,901
- Miss those days.
- Oh, you were in a band?

320
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:47,696
Could have been,
but in high school I was really
all about my magic, so-

321
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,074
Oh, my God. Over.
[Doorbell Ringing]

322
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:53,202
- Oh, that's gonna
be Dad and Gloria.
- Oh, Mitchell.

323
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,580
I know it's silly,
but I'm a little nervous.

324
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,583
Oh. That's not silly.
You should be.
[Door Opens]

325
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,419
Hola.
Hola. How are you?

326
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,255
Manny?
Phil.

327
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,965
Nice mustache.
Thank you.

328
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,175
Don't make fun.
He may burn your house down.

329
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,764
- Oh, boy.
- Dede.

330
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,809
- Hi, Jay, Gloria.
- What is she doing here?

331
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,061
What does she mean,
"What is she doing here?"

332
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,856
- Mitchell told you I'd be here.
- Lies!

333
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,024
I couldn't tell her,
because she wouldn't come.

334
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,318
Gloria, uh, my mom wants
to apologize for everything.

335
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:29,864
So you just spring it
on Gloria like this? Mitchell,
what the hell is wrong with you?

336
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,616
- I don't want her apologies.
- Who could blame you, honey?

337
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,743
Which is why this is
a terrible idea by you!

338
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,954
Jay. Manny. Let's go.

339
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh, wait, wait, Gloria.

340
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:44,128
I- I just want to
tell you how sorry I am
for ruining your wedding.

341
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:48,257
I was struggling
with being alone.

342
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,135
Meanwhile,
Jay moves on so easily,

343
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,679
and-and not with just anyone-

344
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,766
with a... young...

345
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,019
and smart
and beautiful woman.

346
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,396
I don't expect you
to forgive me.

347
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,942
If I were you, I'd want to
punch me right in the mouth.

348
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:14,909
[Sighs]

349
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,995
I think we've had enough revenge
in this family for one day.

350
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,998
Ah. Okay. Y- You see?

351
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:24,376
Yeah, we're all
gonna move past this,
and because of me,

352
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,714
who's not a mama's boy,
but is a caring person with
wisdom and emotional insight.

353
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,800
So make a note, bitches.
It's not a good color on you.

354
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,095
I forgive you.

355
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,557
Oh, wow.

356
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,976
I am not prepared
for this.

357
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:43,020
I just-

358
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,522
I- I wanna rip
your head off!
What?

359
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:48,776
¡Una loca peligrosa!
[Phil]
What are you doing?

360
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,237
You ruined my wedding!
Oh, no!

361
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh!
I got Gloria!

362
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,699
- I got Gloria!
- Mom, come on.

363
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,619
- [Gloria] ¡No! ¿Qué pasa?
- Unbend your legs.

364
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,038
I got Gloria.

365
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,290
Stand up like a big girl.
Come on.

366
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,794
All right. Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it, the two of you.

367
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,296
I am so sorry about this.
No, it's cool. It's cool.

368
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:13,259
This is ridiculous.
Gloria didn't steal me, Dede,
and you know it.

369
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:17,429
We grew apart for years,
and you left to find yourself,
remember?

370
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,015
I thought I could
handle this.

371
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,685
- I'm so sorry.
- You don't say sorry anymore!

372
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,980
That word means nothing
in your mouth!
I got Gloria.

373
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,483
I don't know
what just happened.

374
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,527
[Dylan]
I do.

375
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,740
I mean, it seems
pretty simple to me.

376
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,368
You're reaching out,
trying to hold on
to something awesome.

377
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,912
Um, maybe-
maybe you shouldn't-

378
00:18:41,997 --> 00:18:45,499
Look, look, look.
I'm not used to this-
the whole big family thing.

379
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,753
In my house, we don't
even talk to each other.

380
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,674
You know, it's funny-
the first time I saw Haley,
I knew I liked her.

381
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:56,802
I mean,
she's beautiful and everything,
but it's-it's not just that.

382
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,597
It's that she's got
this killer confidence-

383
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:05,394
you know, the kind of confidence
that you get from having
a family like this...

384
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,396
that's passionate...

385
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,649
and accepting
of hot foreigners...

386
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:14,737
and gay dudes
and nutty people.

387
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,947
You know,

388
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:21,493
a family that actually
loves each other.

389
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,873
I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but maybe
we should let her go with him.

390
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,500
He's perfect.

391
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:33,172
Everybody, Haley says
that Dylan is a musician,

392
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:35,674
and he writes
some great songs.

393
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,801
Yeah.
Play something, bro.

394
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,845
Well, I guess so,
if you want me to.

395
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,097
We could all use
a nice tune right now.

396
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:45,017
This is, uh, actually
a song I wrote for Haley.

397
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,019
It's called
"In the Moonlight."

398
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,438
Lovely title, Dylan.
Thanks.
