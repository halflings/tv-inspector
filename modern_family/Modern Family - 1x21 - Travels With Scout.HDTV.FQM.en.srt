1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,702
Y up from cocoa beach.

2
00:00:12,737 --> 00:00:14,004
Hey, son.
Working hard?

3
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:16,105
He's gonna say, "hardly working."

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,041
I meant to tell you
he was driving out.

5
00:00:19,075 --> 00:00:20,642
Did he say it?
Oh, yeah!

6
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:22,544
good kid!

7
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:25,246
He wasn't supposed to show up
for a few more days.

8
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:27,181
Well, guess what he brought us.

9
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,608
A dog...To keep.

10
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:30,701
Yes!

11
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:31,925
Yes.

12
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,469
Yes, I should have told Claire
about the dog.

13
00:00:34,521 --> 00:00:36,038
And I was going to.

14
00:00:36,073 --> 00:00:38,955
But I-I was just waiting for her
to be in the right mood.

15
00:00:40,537 --> 00:00:42,675
Actually, I did get one "right
mood" a couple nights ago,

16
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,479
But...I cashed that in
for something else.

17
00:00:46,514 --> 00:00:47,968
Am I in trouble?

18
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:51,301
Oh, really, really big.

19
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:52,887
Okay, I'm a little scared.
How bad is this?

20
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,963
Oh, well...

21
00:00:53,997 --> 00:00:55,238
We have a new rule --

22
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:57,355
No sleeping in the bedroom.

23
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,370
Mr. Pritchett?

24
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:05,617
Ben.
Ben Dugan.

25
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:06,724
I went to High School
with Mitch.

26
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:07,871
We were in the drama club
together.

27
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:09,378
That's right.
Yeah.

28
00:01:09,412 --> 00:01:12,264
Geez, I didn't recognize you
without that old-guy makeup on.

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,316
You know, you and Mitch knocked "the
sunshine boys" out of the park.

30
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,689
Mitch was really great in that.

31
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,367
I always thought
he should be an actor.

32
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:20,112
Eh, he's got a real job now.
He's a lawyer.

33
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,184
Ah.
How about you?

34
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:24,034
Still acting.
Fantastic.

35
00:01:24,068 --> 00:01:25,273
Actually, it's exciting.

36
00:01:25,307 --> 00:01:26,949
I'm in a new movie --
"maple drive" -- just came out.

37
00:01:26,984 --> 00:01:28,022
You're kidding me.

38
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:29,527
Look at me --
I know somebody famous.

39
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:31,771
Uh, anyway, I got to go.

40
00:01:31,805 --> 00:01:32,776
Great to see you.

41
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,318
Good to see you, too.
Yeah.

42
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:36,862
Kid's a movie star.

43
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:38,204
Hey, how'd it go in there?

44
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,646
No cavities,
and I got a free toothbrush.

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,155
Hey,
you want to go to the movies?

46
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,527
I just heard about a good one.

47
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,698
But I'm supposed to be
in school.

48
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:45,903
You're supposed to floss, too,

49
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,110
But you got away with that one.

50
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,452
Come on. Let's go.

51
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:51,160
One of the greatest days
of my life

52
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,067
Was when my old man
sprung me from school

53
00:01:53,102 --> 00:01:54,405
And took me to the track.

54
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,946
I wanted to do the same
type of thing for Manny.

55
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,257
Plus, I figured when Gloria
heard about it,

56
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:02,302
Maybe it pays off
in the bedroom.

57
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:05,379
I wonder if that's why
my old man did it.

58
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:07,453
Oh, crap.

59
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,027
Your mother-in-law
just had to have the dog.

60
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,137
Turns out she's allergic.

61
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:14,144
And the pet store
didn't have a grace period

62
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:16,084
Or a return policy or anything?

63
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,321
I got him from the pound.

64
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:19,662
Was there a twister in Kansas?

65
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,969
'cause there's a house
in my driveway.

66
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:24,478
welcome home, Mr. Dunphy.

67
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,618
always a pleasure, Mr. Dunphy.

68
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,161
Indeed it is,
Mr. Dunphy.

69
00:02:29,195 --> 00:02:31,668
Place it there.
Ah, I shall, I shall.

70
00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,438
I miss this.
Get in here!

71
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:34,575
my dad is awesome.

72
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:35,611
He's awesome.

73
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:37,517
He's always up.
He's always happy.

74
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:39,356
I mean, he and I are best buds.

75
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,026
We're like two peas in a pod

76
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,571
Or Siamese twins
or a snake with two heads.

77
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,176
They've actually been all those
things for Halloween.

78
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,613
Yeah.

79
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,049
Hey, this must be scout, huh?

80
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,955
I should warn you --
he sheds.

81
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,695
I made the mistake of letting
him sleep with me on the road.

82
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,834
Now my sheets look like
two bigfoots did it.

83
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,206
pardon the language.

84
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,110
How's mom?

85
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:00,480
Speaking of big feet, eh?

86
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,753
She is on a cruise
with her girlfriends,

87
00:03:02,787 --> 00:03:04,758
Some of which
are not totally unattractive.

88
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,966
Mm. Uh, that reminds me -- she
sent some gifts for the kids.

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,440
Um, I will be right back.

90
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:12,912
You three get better acquainted.
Will do.

91
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:14,250
Fun.
Will do.

92
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:17,325
I cannot believe you got a dog
without consulting me.

93
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,363
This was
a major family decision.

94
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:20,399
It was wrong.
Yeah.

95
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,202
And I'm sorry.
Mm.

96
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:24,275
But we have talked about
getting a dog for years,

97
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,145
And you're the only one
who wasn't into it.

98
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,418
Because I knew that I would be
the one taking care of it.

99
00:03:28,452 --> 00:03:29,954
That's not true.
Oh.

100
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:31,692
No, we will all help.
Mm-hmm.

101
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:35,968
This is a great chance to teach
the kids responsibility.

102
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:38,575
That is exactly what you said
about Luke's paper route.

103
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:56,482
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by kuniva for addic7ed.com</font>

104
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:59,422
<i>Hello?</i>

105
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:04,532
<i>Is anyone in there?</i>

106
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,760
<i>Red's a good color on you.</i>

107
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:20,097
<i>Aah!</i>

108
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,532
It's just a movie.

109
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,533
Oh, he's so cute!

110
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,001
Look at his little face.

111
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,469
I always wanted a dog.
Thanks, grandpa.

112
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,772
Okay, but remember, having a dog
is a major responsibility.

113
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,007
Everyone in the family
has to pitch in.

114
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,274
Can do, Mrs. D.

115
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:39,109
Not you, Dylan.

116
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:41,311
Oh, phew. 'cause I got
a lot on my plate right now.

117
00:04:41,345 --> 00:04:43,613
Hey, look who's here.
Uncle Cam.

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,348
Hey, we heard about
the new addition,

119
00:04:45,382 --> 00:04:46,749
And we had to come right over!

120
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,652
Cameron,
so good to see you again.

121
00:04:49,686 --> 00:04:50,819
<i>Now, that is a shirt.</i>

122
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,187
Oh, well, thank you, Frank.

123
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,855
I get them online.
I'll send you a link.

124
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,690
Oh, well, at home,
I smoke sausages.

125
00:04:55,724 --> 00:04:56,891
<i>I'll send you a link.</i>

126
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:58,626
classic.

127
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,427
And this must be Lily.

128
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:02,662
Oh, yes. She just couldn't wait
to meet the new doggy.

129
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:04,130
I think she's good right here.

130
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:07,333
Let me get in there
and get some of that dogginess.

131
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:08,801
Oh, there it is.

132
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,503
Haley, I got to go.

133
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,671
What's wrong?

134
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:14,439
That was Brian.
He just quit the band.

135
00:05:14,474 --> 00:05:15,907
What? Why?

136
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,776
He's moving to Portland.
His parents got back together.

137
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,777
Oh, that sucks.

138
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,978
I know.

139
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,347
Now we're gonna have to cancel
the gig tomorrow.

140
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,282
Maybe you can find
another drummer.

141
00:05:25,316 --> 00:05:27,417
No, I think it's too late
for that now.

142
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:29,352
I play drums.

143
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:30,553
Huh?

144
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:32,054
Well, I mean,
I haven't played in a while

145
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:33,222
Since Lily's come along,

146
00:05:33,256 --> 00:05:37,191
But if you're in a jam...
I can jam.

147
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:38,759
Well, you know,
I totally would,

148
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:41,394
But I'm not sure we like the
same sorts of music, you know?

149
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:43,463
Oh, what, because I'm gay I'm just
gonna want to play show tunes?

150
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:45,532
, because you're old.

151
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,735
Wow, that hurt more, Dylan.

152
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,771
Give him a chance.
It's better than canceling.

153
00:05:50,805 --> 00:05:52,005
You're right.

154
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,406
Don't want to lose
the deposit on that fog machine.

155
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,374
Okay, let's do it.

156
00:05:57,408 --> 00:05:58,675
I used to be a music teacher,

157
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:00,543
But I gave that up
as soon as Lily came along.

158
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,545
Yes, well, we just felt
that it was really important

159
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,413
That one of us stayed home
to raise her, so...

160
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,748
Yeah, and that's not a judgment
on other people's choices.

161
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,118
It's just that we happen to be
a very traditional family.

162
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:13,454
Yes, that's what
the disabled lesbian shaman

163
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:15,288
Who blessed Lily's room
said, too.

164
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:21,927
How you doing, buddy?

165
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:23,862
All right, relax.

166
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:42,246
Oh, geez.

167
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,637
That is impossible.

168
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,072
My dad is the happiest guy
on earth.

169
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,773
It probably just sounded like
he was crying.

170
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:54,208
Have you heard the noises he makes
when he gets out of a chair?

171
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,709
No, I know what I heard.

172
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:58,378
I think this has something
to do with your mom. What?

173
00:06:58,413 --> 00:07:00,213
Yeah, he came here alone.
Think about it.

174
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,548
She's on a cruise.

175
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,884
Yeah, and they never take
separate vacations, so...

176
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,719
No.
No, if something was wrong,

177
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,220
My dad would tell me about it.

178
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:09,521
No, Phil, he wouldn't,

179
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,222
Because you guys never actually
talk about anything.

180
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,657
We talk all the time.

181
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,392
He crank-calls me at work
like three times a week.

182
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:16,227
Crank calls don't count.
It counts for fun.

183
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,895
No, honestly, I think
that you should find out

184
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,297
What's going on with your dad.

185
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,198
It's going to be nothing.

186
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,167
My dad isn't like your dad.

187
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,168
There's nothing deep and dark
inside.

188
00:07:26,202 --> 00:07:29,738
His hard candy Shell
is just...Hiding more candy.

189
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,740
I think he wants to go out.

190
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:33,842
Go boy.

191
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,709
Smart dog.

192
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:38,312
I hate to break it to you, but
I think all dogs can do that.

193
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:39,613
I'm gonna play outside.

194
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:42,482
Ow!

195
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:45,484
What happened?

196
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,721
Okay, should I just play
a little something?

197
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,190
Yeah, but, you know,
if it doesn't work out,

198
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,258
Don't feel bad.

199
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,093
Well,
hopefully this is --

200
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,360
This is like riding a bicycle

201
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:59,862
And will all come back to me.

202
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:02,097
that's the loud one.

203
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:05,836
So...Here we go.

204
00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:22,350
Hm

205
00:08:22,384 --> 00:08:24,419
Oh, silly me.

206
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:26,921
I had the sticks
in the wrong hands.

207
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,538
Wow.

208
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:48,640
Dude, you should label
those sticks.

209
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:55,612
Is that the alarm?

210
00:08:55,647 --> 00:08:57,380
Has our perimeter
been breached?

211
00:08:57,414 --> 00:09:00,015
It's not the alarm.
The doorbell won't stop ringing.

212
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,883
Maybe a demon is ringing it.
Not a demon.

213
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:04,418
Ay!
Who keeps ringing the doorbell?

214
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:06,620
We're pretty sure it's a demon.

215
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:07,921
Oh, yeah?

216
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:09,622
there.

217
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,691
If it were a demon,
it would keep on ringing.

218
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,325
Not if he's already inside.

219
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,227
I'm getting a weapon.

220
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,995
What were you thinking?

221
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:19,064
Who takes a little boy
to a horror movie?

222
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,198
That's loco, Jay.

223
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,333
Th is no big deal.

224
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,466
You want scary?

225
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:23,567
When I was his age,

226
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,635
I lived through
the Cuban missile crisis.

227
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,670
I slept th a butter knife
under my pillow

228
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:30,372
In case I had to fight
some soviet colonel.

229
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:33,541
Why would they send a soviet
colonel to get a little boy?

230
00:09:33,576 --> 00:09:36,177
Because I could identify
every commie plane.

231
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,644
What are we talking about?

232
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,249
Look, all I'm saying, being
scared is part of growing up.

233
00:09:40,284 --> 00:09:42,219
Manny will get over this.

234
00:09:42,253 --> 00:09:44,621
It builds character.

235
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:46,688
I'll take the first watch.

236
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:48,523
You two might as well
get some rest.

237
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:50,758
It's gonna be a long night.

238
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,896
Character.

239
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,331
Dad?

240
00:09:57,366 --> 00:09:59,166
Come on in.
It's open.

241
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:00,534
Hey.

242
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:02,568
Don't tell me --
you need a cup of sugar.

243
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,404
nah, just, uh...

244
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,273
I was just wondering,
I don't know, uh...

245
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,274
Anything on the old noodle?

246
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:12,509
Other than a bad toupee?

247
00:10:12,543 --> 00:10:14,777
I'm kidding, of course.
This is my real hair.

248
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,278
Well, okay.

249
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:18,247
Wait a mute.
I want task you something.

250
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:19,916
Am I'm putting you
in a bad position

251
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,652
With this whole dog thing?

252
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,522
Claire seemed
a little...Put out.

253
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,957
Oh, don't worry about it.

254
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,426
Claire didn't like me at first,
either.

255
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,394
I can't blame her.

256
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,961
Dismissed.

257
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,263
Oh, dad, um, you know what?

258
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,731
I, uh...

259
00:10:33,765 --> 00:10:35,799
Claire saw something,

260
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,002
And she'd kill me if I --
if I didn't ask.

261
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:38,936
What is it?

262
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,608
Would you wear pants to
breakfast, for crying out loud?

263
00:10:47,043 --> 00:10:48,611
You got me again.

264
00:10:48,645 --> 00:10:50,245
Right in the funny bone.
All right.

265
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,680
Come on, scout.
Let go of it.

266
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:53,048
No, no, no!

267
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,416
Ugh!

268
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:56,585
Dog.
Look at this!

269
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,087
How did he get ahold
of your bra?

270
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:00,421
Well,
uh, we were out on a date,

271
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:01,822
And he has
a really nice car, so --

272
00:11:01,857 --> 00:11:02,790
How do you think?

273
00:11:02,824 --> 00:11:04,591
He got it
out of the laundry basket.

274
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,926
I can't take my eyes
off that dog for a second.

275
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,460
Why don't you just keep him
in the crate?

276
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,063
I tried that.
He figured out how to get out.

277
00:11:11,097 --> 00:11:12,564
I thought you were dealing
with your dad.

278
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:14,299
Oh, yeah. I did.
He's fine, so...

279
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:18,002
Whoa, you got that from
a two-minute conversation?

280
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:21,104
I asked him point-blank
if he was okay.

281
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,972
He said he was,
so I just --

282
00:11:23,006 --> 00:11:26,275
Just swapped some jokes
and moved on.

283
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,678
Phil, the man needs
more of a push than that.

284
00:11:29,713 --> 00:11:32,614
Look, if he wants to talk to me
about it, he will.

285
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,683
Geez, someone's panties
are in a bunch.

286
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:35,950
I thought I was showing
concern and --

287
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,051
No, right there.

288
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,553
Oh, my God.
That damn dog.

289
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:42,322
Guys, a little help.

290
00:11:42,356 --> 00:11:44,558
I have to go to the bathroom,

291
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:46,660
And I'm not gonna do it
in here.

292
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,835
Hey, I got Chinese.

293
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:58,736
Sweet.
I'm starving.

294
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,237
Oh, we have guests.

295
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,006
Yeah, hey. We were just having
a little jam session.

296
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,775
You know Dylan.
This is Craig. This is Neal.

297
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,377
I'll always remember him
as the stranger holding my baby.

298
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,112
Can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a second?

299
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,246
Uh, yeah.

300
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,482
Uh, hey, guys,
let's -- let's just take five.

301
00:12:14,516 --> 00:12:16,317
What's up
with "21 jump street"?

302
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,152
Oh. Oh, well,
their drummer quit,

303
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,353
And I'm gonna fill in for
him tomorrow night. No, no.

304
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:22,488
We have pepper's après-ski fondue
party tomorrow night, Cam.

305
00:12:22,522 --> 00:12:24,256
Oh, no.

306
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,657
So you'll just have to
tell your band

307
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:27,359
That they're gonna have to find
someone else.

308
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:29,360
You know what? No, I'm not gonna
let these fellas down.

309
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:30,461
I made a commitment.

310
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,362
You made two commitments, okay?

311
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,798
And you know how pepper is.
Everything has to be perfect.

312
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,166
He gets mad if you don't wear
a big sweater.

313
00:12:37,201 --> 00:12:40,434
Yeah, I remember. I got so hot last year,
I almost went facedown in the Gruyère.

314
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,435
So I'm going by myself.
Is that what you're saying?

315
00:12:43,537 --> 00:12:45,137
I just feel like
I kind of need this.

316
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:47,940
To round out
your college applications?

317
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:50,642
It's just that because
I'm always home with Lily,

318
00:12:50,676 --> 00:12:52,610
I just feel like I'm going
a little bit stir crazy.

319
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:53,911
Look at the den.

320
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,979
Every time I finish painting it,
I start all over again.

321
00:12:56,014 --> 00:12:58,815
It's like
the Golden Gate Bridge.

322
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,418
I'm gonna go back to jamming.

323
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,188
Aah!

324
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:11,359
Yeah, we got to fix this.

325
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,792
Hey, what's with the big sweater
at a concert?

326
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:22,126
Is that a gay thing?

327
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,396
No, dad, it's for my friend
pepper's après-ski fondue --

328
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,931
Yeah, yeah, it's a gay thing.

329
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:29,598
I hope they start soon.

330
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,666
I don't think scout
likes to be left alone.

331
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,266
You love the dog.

332
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,299
No, I don't love the dog.

333
00:13:35,334 --> 00:13:36,734
I love my couch,

334
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,670
And the dog was looking at it
like it was a giant sausage.

335
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,972
Good news, you two. You're
getting your driveway back.

336
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:43,706
I'm hitting the open road
in the morning.

337
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:44,707
Oh, already?
Yeah.

338
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,442
Anxious to get home and see mom,
huh?

339
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:48,643
No, I'm just gonna drive
wherever the wind blows me,

340
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:50,312
Which is usually
into the next lane.

341
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,980
Can we get some sodas, grandpa?

342
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,715
Okay, but just one.
I'm driving.

343
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,983
Come on.

344
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:57,618
He's not going home?

345
00:13:57,652 --> 00:13:59,119
He's never been away
from my mom

346
00:13:59,154 --> 00:14:00,821
For longer
than a doctor's appointment.

347
00:14:00,855 --> 00:14:02,121
Honey, I know.
I told you.

348
00:14:02,156 --> 00:14:03,222
I always felt bad

349
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,990
For people with
emotionally distant fathers.

350
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:06,525
It turns out I'm one of them.

351
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:09,828
It's a miracle
I didn't end up a stripper.

352
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,796
Hey, thanks, everybody,
for coming out.

353
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,764
These are some songs we wrote.

354
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:15,432
1, 2!

355
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:17,067
1, 2, 3!

356

00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:33,512
I know, right?!

363
00:14:33,546 --> 00:14:37,148
Well, the plan was to watch him
for 10 minutes

364
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:39,249
And then run out
to pepper's party.

365

It was his moment.

371
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:55,830
Come on!

372
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:58,899
Wow!
I know!

373
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,812
And his moment went on
for a really...

374
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,847
Really long time.

375
00:15:31,323 --> 00:15:33,090
Turns out, I could have
run to the party

376
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:35,758
And made it back for the end...

377
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,330
Of his moment.

378
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:43,201
Manny, go brush your teeth
and get ready for bed, okay?

379
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,003
<i>Your bed.</i>

380
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,439
Can I watch TV?

381
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:47,907
Only 10 minutes.

382
00:15:47,942 --> 00:15:49,542
Okay.

383
00:15:57,317 --> 00:15:58,985
Hey, Jay, it's Ben Dugan.

384
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:00,352
I got your message.

385
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,788
Uh, yes, I'm happy to help out.
I'll swing by tonight.

386
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,489
What's that?
That's Ben.

387
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,290
That's the guy
who was in the movie.

388
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,658
I figured when Manny sees him,
sees how nice he is,

389
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,460
He'll realize it's all pretend.

390
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,766
You think that will work?

391
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,135
That guy's a sweetheart.

392
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,837
Manny's gonna spend
two minutes with him.

393
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:21,304
He'll explain
how the movie's made.

394
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,673
He's even bringing
his fake machete.

395
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,175
Thing's made of rubber.

396
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,712
Hey, are you Manny?

397
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,081
I'm here for you!

398
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,216
Look what I got.

399
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:40,152
Aah!

400
00:16:40,187 --> 00:16:42,421
Mom, he's here!

401
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:44,189
Que pasó?! Que pasó?!
Que pasó?!

402
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,791
Ay!

403
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:50,026
We're gonna need a bigger bed.

404
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,127
Oh, geez.

405
00:16:56,497 --> 00:16:58,163
Oh, my God.
I think that's him.

406
00:16:58,198 --> 00:16:59,531
hey!

407
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,299
You stayed.

408
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,967
Yeah. Well, you know,
I'm -- I'm with the band.

409
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:05,536
I thought the gig
was a little sloppy in spots,

410
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,604
But I think once I learn
all the songs...

411
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:10,972
I thought -- I thought this
was a one-time thing.

412
00:17:11,006 --> 00:17:13,240
Are you kidding?
We destroyed in there.

413
00:17:13,274 --> 00:17:15,274
Did you hear that one lady
screaming my name?

414
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,775
That was Phil.

415
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,376
He had a red bull.

416
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,078
Hey, guys, good gig, huh?

417
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:21,880
Yeah, totally awesome.

418
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:23,648
Heck of a gig.

419
00:17:23,683 --> 00:17:25,016
Hey, guys.

420
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,284
Hey.
I thought you were in Portland.

421
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,720
<i>No,
my parents broke up again.</i>

422
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:32,323
I'm not moving.
I can stay in the band.

423
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,595
Well, this --
this is awkward.

424
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,730
Uh...

425
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:39,931
Cam.

426
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,234
Oh, a-awkward for me.

427
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:50,840
Good luck following that,
Ringo.

428
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,610
I believe this belongs to you.

429
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:58,280
I don't want to drag the house
along with me.

430
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:00,048
Come here, you little monkeys.

431
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,716
Bye, grandpa, we'll miss you.

432
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,184
I wish I could take you
with me.

433
00:18:03,218 --> 00:18:05,586
Yeah, drive safe, grandpa.
I'll try.

434
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,454
You sure you don't want to stay
for breakfast?

435
00:18:07,488 --> 00:18:10,222
No, I ought to be
hitting the road.

436
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,858
Whelp...Adiós.

437
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:14,425
Dad, hold on.
Hmm?

438
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,893
Can I talk to you for a second?

439
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,261
Sure.

440
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,831
Guys.

441
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,533
I don't think
you're being honest with me.

442
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:26,236
I-I know something
is going on with you.

443
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:29,204
What's up?

444
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:30,605
Something up?

445
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,774
Well, my boxers are, uh,
riding a little high.

446
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:34,710
I'm not in the mood for jokes
right now,

447
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,977
Although you nailed that.

448
00:18:36,012 --> 00:18:37,011
Thanks. Thanks.
Great stuff.

449
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,814
Thanks.

450
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:41,515
It's nothing.

451
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,117
Oh, it's nothing?

452
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:45,485
Nothing to do with mom?

453
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:47,954
No!

454
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:51,390
Well...Yeah.

455
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:53,025
I've fallen in love.

456
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,927
Oh, my God!
Who is she?

457
00:18:55,962 --> 00:18:57,162
<i>He.</i>

458
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,030
What?

459
00:18:59,064 --> 00:19:01,832
It's that little guy
right over there.

460
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:03,700
Come on over here.
Come on.

461
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:04,701
Come on.

462
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,670
There you go.
Oh, look at him.

463
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:07,971
Driving across country,

464
00:19:08,005 --> 00:19:11,207
This little bastard nuzzled
his way right into my heart.

465
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:12,608
Didn't you?

466
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,210
So, this is just about you
not wanting to leave the dog?

467
00:19:15,244 --> 00:19:16,444
Well, you should tell mom.

468
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:18,312
Those three days
on the road with him

469
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:19,814
Were the happiest of my life.

470
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:21,315
You should leave that part out.

471
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:24,217
I don't want to keep scout
if it makes grandpa sad.

472
00:19:24,251 --> 00:19:27,053
Yeah, I know, sweetie,
but grandma has allergies,

473
00:19:27,087 --> 00:19:29,221
So scout has to stay with us.

474
00:19:29,256 --> 00:19:31,824
Well, she could always just get
some allergy shots.

475
00:19:31,858 --> 00:19:34,093
Honey, you don't want
to put her through that.

476
00:19:34,127 --> 00:19:36,862
Well, hell, back in the day,
I got a vasectomy for her.

477
00:19:36,896 --> 00:19:39,631
Dad, dad, please.

478
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:41,799
Scout's --
scout's your dog.

479
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,967
He should go with you.

480
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:49,905
Okay, you twisted my arm.

481
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,473
Thanks, son.

482
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,441
Thanks for poking through
the armor.

483
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:55,677
You're poking through the armor
down there.

484
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,944
What?
Made you look.

485
00:19:58,246 --> 00:19:59,846
You are a treasure.

486
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,948
Come on, scout.
Let's mosey.

487
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,716
Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait.

488
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:06,819
He loves that.

489
00:20:06,853 --> 00:20:08,687
Oh, I bet he does.

490
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:12,356
<i>No, scout.
This time, I drive.</i>

491
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,190
You still got it!

492
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:16,125
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

493
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,093
But I think
I might have actually

494
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:19,995
Gotten even closer with my dad.

495
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:24,631
I can't believe he took my dog.

496
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,600
Bye, pop! Bye, grandpa!
Love you!

497
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:28,201
Bye, dad.

498
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,805
Bye, grandpa! I love you!
Luke, stay!

499
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,209
Luke, stay!
Come back soon!

500
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,744
I'll see you later!
Luke, stay!

501
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,512
Luke!
Stay!

502
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,513

503
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,335
Frank.

504
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:40,369
Hey, Jay!

505
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,337
Good to see you.
Great to see you.

506
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,105
Didn't expect to find you here.

507
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,808
Well, listen, when my
granddaughter's boyfriend's band

508
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:48,209
Plays an under-21 club

509
00:20:48,243 --> 00:20:51,346
With my daughter-in-law's
brother's gay partner,

510
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,380
I show up.

511
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:53,848
That's just how I was raised.

512
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,483
I don't think you met my wife,
Gloria.

513
00:20:55,517 --> 00:20:56,650
Hola.

514
00:20:56,685 --> 00:21:00,117
Well, it's a pleasure.
You are a lovely woman.

515
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:01,151
You must be Frank.

516
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,853
Okay, then.

517
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,856
You are hotter than a Las Vegas
sidewalk on the 4th of July.

518
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,924
did I go too far?

519
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,292
Not you, Frank.
No.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
