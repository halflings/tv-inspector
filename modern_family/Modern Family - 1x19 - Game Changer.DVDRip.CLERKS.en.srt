00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,087
Today Sam Riley
kicked a soccer ball...

2
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:07,257
and it hit another kid so hard
his eye popped out.

3
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,758
Awesome!

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,719
Really?
His eye popped out.

5
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:13,221
Never mind.
[Phil] Well, gotta hit
the sack. Big Saturday tomorrow.

6
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,849
That's right.
It's somebody's birthday.

7
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,018
Not just that.
The iPad comes out-

8
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:20,187
on my actual birthday.

9
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,398
It's like Steve Jobs and God
got together to say,
"We love you, Phil."

10
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,943
What is so great
about that doohickey anyhow?
"Doohickey," Elly May?

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:30,655
It's a movie theater,
a library and a music store...

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,325
all rolled into
one awesome pad.

13
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:35,869
A library is a place
where people get books.

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,872
A movie theater is a place
where people go on dates.

15
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,958
I better load the beach chair
into the trunk. I'm gonna need
it for the line in the morning.

16
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:45,420
Wait, honey. Hang on.
You can't spend
your birthday in line.

17
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:48,757
Well, not the whole day.
I have to be there at 6:00,
or forget about it.

18
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,009
Then I'm out by 10:00.
Why don't you let me do it?

19
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,928
Claire, you don't
have to do that.

20
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,971
No, I know, but I want to.

21
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,643
And that way on your birthday
you'll wake up and you'll
have your brand-new toy.

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,562
Okay.

23
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,940
Well, in spite of you
calling it a toy,

24
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,943
this is shaping up to top
the best birthday I ever had.

25
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,987
Oh, thank God we didn't have
to hear that stupid story
about that place-

26
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,323
It was called the Fun Zone.
I was 11.
[Groans]

27
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,409
I hit 10 straight fastballs
in the batting cage.

28
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:20,330
Then my best friend
Jeff Sweeney stepped in
and took one in the groin.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:24,918
I yelled out "Ball two!"
Everybody laughed.

30
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:27,337
That was when I knew
I was funny.

31
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,299
Good night.

32
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:35,303
B-E-L-I-E-V-E.
Believe.

33
00:01:35,388 --> 00:01:37,931
Are you sure there's not
an "E-I" in the middle?

34
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,766
No. It's "I-E."
Good, papi!

35
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,852
If I can't fool you,
then your teachers
can't fool you either.

36
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,355
I don't think
they're trying to fool me.

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,357
Wait until you see what
I got Phil for his birthday.

38
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,859
I found it on
the SkyMall catalog.

39
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,862
Ay. It's not one of those
talking alarm clocks?

40
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,491
"It's 6:05. It's 6:25.
Wake up. Wake up."

41
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,411
Even better.
A rosewood chess set.

42
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,414
As matter of fact,
before I wrap this thing,
what say we take it for a spin?

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,542
- Come on, Manny. I'll teach you.
- He knows how to play.
His father taught him.

44
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm gonna teach him real chess,
not the Colombian version.

45
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,048
We actually use the pieces to
play the game, not smuggle stuff
out of the country.

46
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:15,010
Uh, I know one Colombian piece
you won't be playing with later.

47
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:18,096
Manny, come on.
Let's see what you got.
You'll be surprised.

[Spanish]

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,271
Manny's an excellent player,
but Jay is a grumpy loser.

50
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:31,151
He mopes, he makes the face,
he slams the door, then he said
he didn't slam the door.

51
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,820
It's better that he wins.

52

[Crying On Baby Monitor]

53
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,786
Um, I got this.

It's okay. It's okay.

There's a man

Oh, thank God.

[Yells]
It's me, it's me,
it's me, it's me.

62
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,075
She's fine. We must have
just heard a neighbor
with the same monitor.

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,910
Thank God.

No. No, because I was finally

It's kind of a kid's guide to chess.

want to play again.

Now we're lighting a fire.
Let me toss this out.

If you beat me, if that day
should ever come, I'll give you-

Now, I want you to go first.

Now remember, try to open up
the middle of the board.

I'd have moved that guy
two spaces.

And you don't want to bring
your queen out that quickly.

So much drama.

Okay, Jake told Debbie
that he had to work late.

102

So she called his boss
and found out that he didn't.
Busted!

103
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:39,214
So she spent all morning
on the phone crying and crying
and crying to her mother...

104
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:43,968
and said if Jake has
to work "late" one more time,
she's filing for divorce.

00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,628
[Laughs]
You are the best wife ever!

149
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,130
You are the best wife ever!

150
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,299
I didn't get you the iPad.

151
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,927
I got to the store
and they were all out.
I'm so sorry.

152
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,846
I don't understand.
My online buddies got it.

153
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,974
SAT800 and Brobot
didn't get there until 8:00.

154
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:57,935
And you definitely got there
before they did, because
you got there at 6:30.

155
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,647
No, no, no! You didn't
get there at 6:30?
Where were you?

156
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,108
I set the alarm for 5:00.
I got up, I came downstairs,
I fell asleep.

157
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:08,529
No! Oh, my goodness.
What have I done?
What have I done?

158
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:11,991
I should've done this myself.
Sweetie, you know what?
They're gonna get more in next week.

159
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:15,453
Next week? That's
the worst thing you can say
to an early adopter.

160
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,999
Where are you going?
To a place where birthdays
still mean something.

[Doorbell Rings]
[Manny]
I'll get that.

163
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:33,137
Hi, Manny.
Mitchell?

164
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,392
What are you doing here at...
4: 17 on a Saturday afternoon?

165
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,395
Oh, I'm just returning
my dad's belt of tools, so-

166
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,605
At 4: 17 on a Saturday afternoon?

167
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,108
Don't you have
something better to do?

168
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,235
[Chuckles]
Hey.

169
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,612
So, were you a big hit?
What do you mean?

170
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:53,199
Well, I just assumed there
was some kind of costume party.
Was Cam the Indian?

171
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,953
No. For your information, Dad,
we were actually doing a little
construction at the house.

172
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,039
Ah.
What'd you build?
A gift-wrapping station.

173
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:03,042
And we're back.
So, thank you for that.

174
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,211
You're welcome.

175
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,214
Hey, uh, Dad, do you remember
when I was, uh, probably 11...

176
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,550
and you were teaching me
how to fight, and then I quit?

177
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:13,928
Yeah, when you said everything
you needed to learn you'd
learn from West Side Story.

178
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,680
Yeah.
How'd that work out
for you?

179
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:19,142
If I'm ever in a dance fight,
I'll let you know.
[Both Laughing]

180
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,770
So, yeah-
Is-Is the offer, uh, still good?

181
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,856
Why? What's the matter?
You got problems with Cam?

182
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,442
No! Wh-Why would you say that?

183
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,653
Well, come on.
I mean, you know,
sharing a room with a guy?

184
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,197
I bunked with my brother.
I know that can get pretty rough.

185
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,949
I don't "bunk" with Cam.

186
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:38,619
Dad, I just wanna learn
a little self-defense, you know.
Show me what you remember.

187
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,664
Right- Right now?
Yeah.

188

Okay, uh- Gosh, uh-
Thumbs out.

189
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,336
Thumbs.
That a boy.
And then-

190
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,595
That wasn't- That wasn't
very pretty, was it?

191
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,599
You know what? Maybe it
was a little too pretty.
That's the thing.

192
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,934
Here it goes.

Oh!
[Groaning]
Oh, man!

194

Buddy! Think the problem is,
you're not jumping from high enough.

195
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,901
You should get on top
of the garage.

kill your brother.

one of those iPad thingies.

one of these iPads. Okay?

201
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:27,752
Luke? Sweetie, that means
stay out of everyone's way
and stop inhaling the balloons.

202
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,796
[Squeaky Voice]
I'm not inhaling them.

Stop lying.

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,717
How did she know?

205
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:41,349
Didn't your mama teach you
never to take a ride from a stranger?

206
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,142
Got a little vacation time coming up?

209
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,899
Maybe you should
come see the doctor...

210
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,901
and I'll get rid of it!

Attention. If you're here
for Phil's birthday party,

in the picnic area.

She put together
a whole party for me.

Does that really make up
for not getting an iPad?

you don't have to
make the first move.

your opponent's
gonna be overconfident.

He's gonna think
you don't know anything.

- Yeah, but a quick one.
- Okay.

Because you're like a baby
when you don't win.

With the kicking
and the eyebrows...

of the sunflower seeds.

00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,540
You're not that good in chess.
I beat you on our honeymoon.
Or did I let you win?

294
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,043
You didn't let me win.

295
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,629
Why would I sacrifice my queen
for your pawn, Jay?

296
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,715
Huh? Huh?

297
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,346
Huh?
Stop saying that.

[Beeps]
Luke, honey, hi.
What's going on?

300
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:01,150
They guy came with Dad's cake,
but just so you know,
it's missing a piece.

301
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:04,320
Luke, did you take a bite
out of your father's cake?
No.

302
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,906
Stop lying, Luke.
I'm not lying.

303
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:10,201
By the way, I used your
credit card to pay him.
Is that all right?

304
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,828
Oh, no, that's fine.
Whatever.

305
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:14,789
That's why I left the wallet there.

306
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,374
Oh, my God.

307
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,419
Oh, my God!

308
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,048
I left the wallet there!
I left the wa- Your poor father.

309
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,551
All this running around,
and he's gonna think nobody
cares about him on his birthday.

310
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,428
More cake?

311
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:31,388
Why not, Little Phil?

312
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,432
I got no place else to go.

313

[Chattering]

314
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,445
Sir! Sir!
Sir, hi. Excuse me.

315
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,448
Um, yes. I know
this is highly unusual,

316
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,284
but I need your help
to save a marriage.

317
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,078
There is a couple
in this neighborhood...

318
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,539
that is about to get a divorce
for a simple misunderstanding.

319
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,207
Their name is
Jake and Debbie.

320
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,209
And I know
you've taken an oath...

321
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,962
to not tell people
where other people live,
and I respect that,

322
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,090
but maybe we could
work out some sort of
super secretive spy signal,

323
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,926
where if you scratch
your left ear, you know,
maybe they live on the left,

324
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,970
and if you scratch
your right ear, they live on-

325
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,013
They live right here.

326
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,599
Oh.

327
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,394
This conversation
never happened.

328
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,274
Sorry.
Oh, thank God!

329
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,234
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

330
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,279
Dad just put me to sleep.
Oh, the hunting story.

331
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,989
Hmm.
No.

332
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,741
Oh, my gosh, no.
You can't cut the line.
Sorry.

333
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,451
I was here.
Uh-uh.

334
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:38,747
I-I've been here for an hour
and a half and you haven't been,
so you cut the line.

335
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,791
Whatever.
Whoa. Excuse me, sir.

336
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:43,794
I don't think you understand.
You're not getting in front of us.

337
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,379
Calm down,
gingerbread.

338
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,258
- Are you gonna move or not?
- No.

339
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh, no.

340
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,637
Then you leave me
no choice.

341
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:57,183
Oh, my God.
Go to sleep.

342
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:00,102
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
No.

343
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,855
Mitchell, what are you doing?
Get off of him.
Shut up.

344
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,899
He's about to
go to sleep.
No, I'm not.

345
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,984
Okay, folks.
Let's break this up.
You three- out of line.

346
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,361
Oh, no. I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

347
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,656
I'm just waiting in line
to get an iPad.
I don't even know this guy.

348
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,158
Oh, my God.
I need your credit card.

349
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,035
He's the problem.
Shut up!
You're supposed to be asleep.

350
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,661
It's okay. I have it.
Get off!

351
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,205
I've got it.
What?

352
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,373
I've got your card.
I'm good. No, I'm good.

353
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm good. I'm here.
I'm here!

354
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,794
I've gotta get my husband
an iPad!

355
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,506
Key to a good birthday?
Low expectations.

356
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,760
Thought I was getting an iPad.
I was wrong about that.

357
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:36,222
Thought I was getting a surprise
party at the batting cages.
Sorry, Big Phil.

Guess when it comes
right down to it,

we're all just Jeff Sweeney
taking a fastball to the plums.

361
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:49,360
Hey, um, Dad, your cake
fell off the counter,

362
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,528
but Uncle Cam's trying to fix it.

363
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,530
He won't.

364
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,532
And the pizzas
never showed up.

365
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,534
And they won't!

366
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,495
Hey, balloons.

367
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:02,373
Fine. I guess
we'll never know.
Or we can find out right now.

368
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,375
Yeah, Manny,
give me the chess set.

369
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,544
- Oh, it's a chess set.
- Yeah. You'll get it later.
We got something to settle now.

370
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,797
Go in there.
Happy birthday, Phil.

371
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,215
Happy happy.

372
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:13,968

baked Brie I smell?

373
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:15,552
No.

374
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,807
Oh, Cam, Cam,
you'll never believe
what happened.

375
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,101
Happy birthday, Phil!
Sure!

376
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,270

And we saved a marriage.

378

It really is.

Easy.

and I burn this house down!

Ah, but look at this-
Honey, honey.

387
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:54,133
What are we doing?
This is ridiculous.

388
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:58,512
One of us is gonna win the game,
the other's gonna feel lousy,
and we both lose.

389
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:03,892
Yeah, just leave
my birthday present
on the floor.

390
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,936
That's my girl.
[Jay]
She had me.

391
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,482
There was no way I could win.
I knew it. I'm just glad
she didn't know it yet.

392
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,985
Two moves, and then-
[Cutting Sound]

393

I'm a very good chess player.

But I'm a better wife.

No.

Just heading out to the yard
to get a shovel for my cake.
Mom.

404
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,391
- Luke, what do you want?
- I went on Dad's computer,

405
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,560
contacted some
of his geek friends,

406
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:50,439
told them that he was dying
and his last wish was an iPad.

407
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,483
Luke, what have I
told you about-

408
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,486
One of them felt so bad,
they brought over an extra.

409

Oh, my God. You got it!

415
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:19,385
All this time I said
I didn't care, but I do care.
I care so much!

416
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,762
Do you want to
blow out the candles?
Yes.

00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,847
Go on. Go.

Yes, it did!
Honey!

Oh, who's ready for the first day
of the rest of their lives?

421
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,067
Phil, happy birthday!
Look at this!

422
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:38,570
Can I touch it?
Yeah, not so hard,
but touch it.

423
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,657
Touch it, but don't touch it.
Touch it, but don't touch it.

I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.

425
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,415
I love you.
[Jake] Thank God
that guy came over.

426
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:53,502
What did he say his name was?
He didn't.
Must be an angel.

427
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,087
Did you hear that?
I'm an angel.

428
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,423
[Jake]
Or some creepy perv.
Yeah.

429
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,927
Wow.
How did he know?
Eww.

430
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:04,721
[Jake]
Maybe I should call the police.
You should call the police.

431
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,891
I'm gonna call the police.
And they lived happily ever after.

432
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,185
No, Cam. Where are you going?
It was just getting good.

433
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,855
I want-
That's my program.
