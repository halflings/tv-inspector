Well, that's a-

00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:07,174
That is a tough one,
but I would say yes.
People can change.

00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:11,344
That's what I believe anyway,
and I will till the day I die.

you're proving the exact
opposite of your point?

at the TV when I want
to watch the TV?

No. You point it
at the receiver.
What's a receiver?

Okay, imagine our home theater
system is a human body.

is the brain.

grilled-cheese sandwich
and tomato soup.

55

Tomato soup because,
you know, the tomato soup
is like the blood.

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,210
And the vampires like
to eat the blood.

00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,427
I am sorry.
It's okay.

149
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,388
He just seemed
so mature online.

150
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,933
How could I be so stupid?
[Manny]
You're not stupid.

151
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:17,145
"Stupid" is not following your heart
and taking a chance on love.

152
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,648
I mean, what kind of 11 -year-old
talks like that?

153
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,568
[Crying]
Manny's an old soul.

154
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:26,154
Here. Use my handkerchief.

155
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,156
You see what I mean?

156
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,325
I'll just be alone
for the rest of my life.

157
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,328
And that's okay.
No, don't say that.

158
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,247
In my country,
there's a saying
that means...

159
00:07:36,332 --> 00:07:39,000
"Love is just
around the corner."

160
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:42,545
I come from a neighborhood
with a lot of prostitutes.

161
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,382
Maybe for you. I mean,
men must throw themselves
at you every day.

162
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,885
They'II do the same for you
if you just-

163
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,639
Just what?
Put out?
No. Just-

164
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,267
Like, the lipstick,
the hair, push-up bra.
You know.

165
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:59,562
[Sniffles]
What's it matter? I'm never
gonna be as pretty as you.

166
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,774
Ay, believe me,
this takes a lot of work.

167
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,859
You just need to find
your inner beauty.

168
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,279
It's hiding beneath
a mask of insecurity.

169
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,323
Okay, he's starting
to freak me out.

170
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,241
Manny, go play.

171
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,373
Mitchell, how do these
look to you?

172
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,583
Like they're dying.
I know. Right?

173
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:23,795
I said something to the florist.
He said, "Don't worry about it.
They're gonna come back."

174
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,922
They're not coming back.
They've crossed to the other side.

175
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:28,007
You are a funny man.
Why?

176
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,009
You're completely bothered
by the flowers.

177
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:32,845
But when my father introduces you
as "a friend of my son,"

178
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,972
doesn't faze you in the least.

179
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:36,766
Because the florist
played me for a fool.

180
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,976
Your dad didn't mean any harm.
He's just being who he is.

181
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,521
When I was back East
in law school,

182
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,525
my dad used to call me
every Saturday at 6:00 p.m.,
before people would go out,

183
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,694
just to, you know,
check in, catch up.

184
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:52,156
And then, I think,
the Christmas of my second year,

185
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,118
I finally got up
the courage to tell him.

186
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,541
After that, I-I... pretty much
just talked to my mom.

187
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,543
[Quietly]
Don't cry.

188
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,670
I'm not crying.

189
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,715
I'm home!
[Gloria]
We're here.

190
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,509
[Door Closes]
This is Whitney.
We're giving her a makeover.

191
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,178
Hi. You have such
a nice family...

192
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:16,806
and a really
beautiful house.

193
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,559
- Thanks. You two
know each other how?
- She's my date.

194
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:22,228
Of course she is.
I'll be in here.

195
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,313
[Whispers]
I'll be right back.

196
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,525
I'm sorry this didn't
turn out like you wanted.

197
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,527
That's okay.

198
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,863
Probably didn't turn out
how you wanted it either.

199
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,575
I'll tell you what.
If neither of us is
with anybody in 10 years,

200
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,119
how about you and me
give it a shot?

201
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:40,955
That's disturbing.

202
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,707
But maybe.

203
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,584
How was your lunch
with the boys?
Good.

204
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,878
Ran into Mitchell
and Cam.
Ay, nice.

205
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:51,048
You're not gonna believe this.
Mitchell says Shorty's gay.
Shorty?

206
00:09:51,175 --> 00:09:53,760
Yeah, I believe it.
Oh, come on!

207
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:58,097
Well, he's a great dresser,
a great dancer.
That doesn't prove anything.

208
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:01,309
He's the only one of your
friends that never hits on me.
My friends hit on you?

209
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,102
Yes, all the time,
but don't worry.

210
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,104
They're a bunch
of harmless old men.

211
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,064
They're my age.

212
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,901
I'm sure it's very hard on Shorty
to keep a secret like that.

213
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,236
Jay, I think
you should talk to him.
What?

214
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,948
You're the only one with a gay son.
I'm sure he'll appreciate
opening up to you.

215
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,950
We're guys.
We don't open up.

216
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:22,705
We talk about sports and cars,
getting up in the middle
of the night to pee.

217
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,084
I'm sure you made it
very easy for Mitch
to come out of the closet.

218
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:30,046
Yeah.
Okay. I'm gonna finish
my makeover.

219
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,466
Because I care about people.

220
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,053
Because I want to help them
change their lives.

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:40,056
Jay, I'm hinting that you
should call your friend, okay?

222
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,183
Yes. I'm getting that.
Okay, okay.

[Crunches]

225
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:58,658
Why would you do that
to a brand-new,
very expensive remote?

226
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:02,245
Because I lost my temper,
and it didn't work.
Therefore, it's useless.

227
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,247
Well, honey, when it comes
to anything electronic,

228
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,165
you're not exactly
the best student.

229
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,167
I am very smart.

230
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,670
I had a 4.0 in college.
How about you?

231
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,673
I was almost that
despite my substantial
time commitment to cheerleading.

232
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,425
I thought we agreed not
to bring up the cheerleading.

233
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,095
Cheerleading in my college
was cool.

234
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,764
The football players
were so jealous, they wouldn't
even let me and my buddies-

235
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:25,101
Trevor, Scotty and Ling-
go to their parties.

236

Seriously, Claire,

237
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,356
you owe me an apology
for breaking that.

238
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,777
Okay. Phil, I apologize for breaking
the world's worst remote...

239
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,445
that you bought... stupidly.

240
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,701
Excuse me, but the experts
at CNET.com rated it
the best remote.

241
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,911
They gave it
three and a half mice.

242
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,747
Wow. I have an idea.
Let's invite the gang
from CNET over...

243
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,834
and your old buddies from cheerleading,
and we can have a nerd party.

244
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,920
Ling is not a nerd.
He built his own helicopter.

245

And if he was alive today-
Sweet pea, let's not
talk about Ling.

You know
what I'm gonna do?
Hmm?

I'm gonna buy a new remote-
the same remote.

And just to prove
how wrong you are,

250

dumbest kid how to use it
in 20 minutes or less.

No.
Yeah, Haley.

and then I'll apologize.

you're never gonna get
that shaft where it belongs.

294
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,965
Hey, you know what?
How about a coffee?

295
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,967
Let's get a coffee.
Sure.

296
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,761
Now press the button
labeled "Activities."

297
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,805
Where is that?
It's just to the right.
To the right.

298
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,474
And now choose
"Watch DVD."
What?

299
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,518
Honey, you gotta focus.
We've only got 20 minutes.

300
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,520
Pretend-
Pretend the mall's closing.

301
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,107
Dad, this is stupid.
I watch TV on my computer.
Why do I have to learn this?

302
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,151
Because your mom
doesn't think you can.

303
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,403
Nobody can.
Haley, listen to me.

304
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,697
Listen to me.

305
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,949
I know this seems impossible.

306
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:30,661
But this is for all those times
that Mom told you she was right...

307
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,663
and you knew she was wrong.

308
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:39,170
I'll do it.
That's my girl.

309
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,589
You know, that guy's
got a beautiful stroke.

310
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,508
Look at his pants-
no pleats.
I like pants like that.

311
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,969
You think I can get away
with something like that?
Sure. Why not?

312
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,557
Listen, Shorty, uh,
we know each other
a long time, right?

313
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,726
What, 30 years?
Yeah.

314
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,897
And, um, I sense
that you got a secret...

315
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,982
that's maybe causing you
a lot of anguish.

316
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,903
You heard something, right?

317
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:07,156
Well, I had the same situation
with my son, Mitchell.

318
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,743
Really?
Yeah, and I didn't
handle it too well either.

319
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:15,873
And, uh, I just want you to know
that you can open up to me,

320
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,125
that I'm gonna do all I can
to help you.

321
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,589
[Exhales]
Well, I mean I-

322
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:26,509
I never said this out loud
before to anyone.

323
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,303
But I guess, if I did,
it would be you.
[Chuckling]

324
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,806
It's just that, Jay,
you see, I'm, uh-

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,518
I'm-

326
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,479
Go ahead. Yeah.
Go ahead.

327
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,856
I'm in debt.
Huh?

328
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,068
I owe a bookie 20 G's,
and he's a serious guy.

329
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,488
And you offering
to give me the dough-
This is beautiful.

330
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,199
Wait a minute.
You're not gay?
Gay?

331
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,368
What are you
talkin' about- gay?

332
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,537
I'm not gay.
Where'd you get gay?

333
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,206
Come on. I mean, you're always
talking about clothes
and everything, right?

334
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,543
My father was a tailor.
I like clothes. So what?

335
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,586
Are you calling
my father gay?
No!

336
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,548
My father landed on Normandy
to save your ass.

337
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,550
You know, if you weren't
lending me 20 G's,

338
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,052
I'd knock you out right now.

339
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,391
Take a check?

340
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,393
Cash would be better.

341
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,689
Haley. You ready?

342
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,774
Let's do this.

343
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,861
Turn on the TV.

344
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,446
[Announcer] Angela says,
after he colored her hair-
Nice.

345
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,448
It turned gray
and then green.
Mute it.

346
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,117
[Remote Beeps]
[Sound Off]

347
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,952
Un-mute it.
[Beeps]

348
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,121
Sixty-five dollars.

349
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:41,250
- Put on a DVD.
- Hairdresser Frederick Longmire
denies he's responsible.

350
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,711
- Skip forward.
- Wait.

351
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,005
Um.
[Remote Beeps]

352
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,675
- [Man On P.A., Indistinct]
- Okay. Back to TV.

353
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,053
- [Beeps]
...better than that.

354
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,307
Face!
Don't get all cocky, Phil.

355
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,058
Let's see what happens
to little Haley...

356
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,228
when I do... this.

357
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:03,981
Ho, ho, ho. Ho!
Face.

358
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,358
Dad, wh- What do I do?

359
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,111
Don't panic.
We went through this.
Just- Just think.

360
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,197
Give up.
Give up. Admit defeat.

361
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,283
[Calmly]
Haley.
Okay. Uh, let's see.

362
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,037
You put the remote
on to TV mode...

363
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,289
and then press "Input"...

364
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:24,710
till you get HDMI 1 and-

365
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,504
- [Crowd Cheering]
- [Haley Laughing, Whooping]

366
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,466
- I did it!
- She did it!

367
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,135
[Both Laughing]

368
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,138
Fine. You proved your point.

369
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,224
Everybody in this house
is smarter than me.

370
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,226
No, honey, you're
missing the point.

371
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,770
I taught Haley how to use
the remote in 20 minutes.

372
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,813
So think how fast
you can learn it.

373
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,607
What's that
supposed to mean?

374
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,400
See what I'm saying?

375
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,028
[Pounding]
[Jay]
Mitchell, it's me!

376
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,240
Hey, Dad.
Hi.

377
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,243
I'm here to let you know
your gaydar is broken.

378
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,038
Shorty is not gay.
No. I, uh-
I knew that.

379
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,874
I made that up
to mess with you
for dissing Cam.

380
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,752
What? That cost me
20,000 bucks.

381
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:10,881
- What do you mean?
- I reached out to him to let
him know it's okay to be gay.

382
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,842
You did?
Yeah.

383
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,387
Right after one of the stranger
golf lessons of my life.

384
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,056
Turns out what he is
is a lousy gambler,

385
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,850
and now I'm the one
on the hook for it.

386
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,311
[Chuckles]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

387
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,147
Then why are you smiling?
I'm- I'm proud
of you, Dad.

388
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:30,567
And you're growing.
Just-Just stop it.
Please.

389
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,611
Don't you see how hard
this is for me?

390
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:35,406
See, I used to be just like one
of those guys. Now look at me.

391
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,491
I got a house
looks like Little Colombia.

392
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,535
I got a gay son
and a Chinese granddaughter.

393
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,371
- Vietnamese.
- Only you would
know the difference.

394
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,124
Don't worry, Dad.
Not growing too much.

395
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,750
[Whitney]
I'm a little nervous.

396
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,795
Don't be.
I'm sure you look beautiful.

397
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,923
[Gloria Gasps]
[Manny]
Whoa!

398
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:56,677
What do you think?
Look at you!
[Laughing]

399
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,805
Really?
[Doorbell Rings]

400
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,182
You're gonna be fighting men off
with a stick.

401
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,143
I don't know about that.

402
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,980
Cameron!
Hi. Sorry
for the pop over,

403
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,065
but I just wanted
to bring you these...

404
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,026
to thank you
for babysitting Lily
again last night.

405
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,069
Oh!
[Both Kiss Loudly]

406
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,071
¡Gracias! You didn't
need to do that.

407
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,115
You know I love Lily.
I know.

408
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,117
Come in.
Say hello.

409
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,702
Hey, Cam.
Hi, Manny.

410
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,204
Manny, how are you?
Cameron, this is
my new friend, Whitney.

411
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,082
Whitney, this is Cameron.
Hello.
It's nice to meet you.

412
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,084
That is a spectacular dress.

413
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,420
This old thing?
[Chuckles]

414
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:33,339
What about her hair?
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,215
It's like Barbra Streisand
in The Way We Were.

416
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,718
One of my favorites.
Me too.

417
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,680
Okay, who is reading
The Forevers?

418
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,265
I am.

419
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,143
I am so obsessed
with this whole
vampire thing right now.

420
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,145
Me too.

421
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,190
I just met the sweetest guy
named Cameron.

422
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,650
I think he might be the one.

423
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:56,195
[Mitchell]
Can people change? I don't know.

424
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,325
People are who they are-
give or take, yeah, 15%.

425
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,703
That's how much
people can change
if they really want to.

426
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:07,581
Well, I'll see you
when I see you.
Yeah, thanks for-

427
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,258
[Whispering]
Haley, sweetie, wake up.

428
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:22,429
What?
I need you to teach me
to use the TV.

429
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,766
Now? Why can't
Dad teach you?

430
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,018
Because we're married.

431
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:33,232
Whether it's for themselves
or for the people they love-

432
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,983
That way. Yeah.

433
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,027
And then press-
Mmm! I got it.

434
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,614
Yeah. Yeah, 15%.
[Remote Beeps]

435
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,533
[Both Cheering]

436
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:44,118
But you know what?
I did it!

437
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:47,830
Sometimes that's just enough.
I did it!

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,835
All right, I'll see you guys
next week, huh?

439
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,545
[All Chattering]
Jay. Jay.

440
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:00,050
Listen, I wanna thank you for,
you know, helping me out
with that jam.

441
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,970
It was nothin'.
No, no, no. And I got you
a little present.

442
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,763
You didn't have to do that.
No, I did.

443
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,142
Two tickets to see
the great Michael Bublé.

444
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,477
The guy sings like an angel.

445
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,479
He's gonna be outside
at one of the amphitheaters.

446
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,231
Gloria's gonna love it.

447
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:16,358
No. I'm talkin' about
you and me.
Oh, you and me.

448
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,110
Yeah.
Well, that's a little-

449
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,779
I thought maybe we could
have a little picnic
since it's outside.

450
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:23,824
You know? I'll get some
nice bottle of wine,
a little cheese.

451
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:26,618
Lay on a nice blanket.
All right?
Yeah, fine.

452
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,247
Yo, hey. I like your hair.
Who does your hair? Huh?

453
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,708
Yo, handsome.
Who does your hair?

454
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:38,589
