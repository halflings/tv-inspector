00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,581
Good. Now we can open
that general store.

153
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,458
I thought we were just
here to get diapers.

154
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,794
We had a saying on the farm:
As long as you're bringing
the mule to the market, you-

155
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,921
I feel you rolling
your eyes at me.

156
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,758
We met at one of Pepper's
legendary game nights.

157
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,218
I remember Mitchell because
he kept rolling his eyes...

158
00:07:49,345 --> 00:07:51,763
every time I would get
a little boisterous.
I did not.

159
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,098
A little bit.

160
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:57,185
Yeah, maybe a little bit.
Anyway, we were-

161
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,937
we were playing charades,
and I had no idea
how to act out my clue.

162
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,273
And all I could think of
to do was-

163
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,526
And without missing a beat,
Cam says-

164
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,487
Casablanca.

165
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,697
All I did was this-
Casablanca.

166
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,325
Casablanca.

167
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,535
Can we just
please get the diapers
and get out of here?

168
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,663
Fine, but I wanna stop
by the wine section first.

169
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,624
[Chuckles]
Wait. There's a wine section?

170
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,210
Yeah, a really good one-
just past the tires.
No way.

171
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,213
They do not have-
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:28,508
Oh, my- Cam. Cam.
The paper shredder I wanted.

173
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,218
Huh?
Confetti and crosscut.

174
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,553
Yep.
[Chuckles]

175
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:36,057
[Gasps]
Oh, my God. Amazing.

176
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,809
Yeah.

177
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:44,232
Cam, what is this place?

178
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:47,068
[Timer Dings]

179
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,029
Those cookies
smell like heaven.
Your own recipe?

180
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,031
No, I just throw 'em
in the oven.

181
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:55,118
And added the secret
ingredient of caring?

182
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Sure.

183
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,080
So, you and Luke
having a good time?

184
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,541
I don't know.
He won't come out of his box.

185
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:05,628
Maybe I'll just stay here
and spend some time
with my sister.

186
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:09,215
Oh, right. I guess
technically I would be
your stepsister.

187
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,010
My mother says we are never
to use the word "step"
because it means "not real."

188
00:09:13,137 --> 00:09:15,304
And we are a real family.
Mmm.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,641
So what is the matter, Claire?

190
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,812
- What?
- You seem sad.

191
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:27,066
It's just stuff with Alex.
You know, kid stuff.

192
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:28,818
[Scoffs]
Kids.

193
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,988
You don't have to tell me.
My school is full of them.

194
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,452
I was thinking after lunch
we can go and do
a little shopping.

195
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,454
I'm not getting a dress.

196
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,497
I don't care.
I'm not your mother.

197
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,666
I know.
You're my grandmother.

198
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:45,918
Step-grandmother.

199
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:48,755
Anyways, today,
think of me as a girlfriend.

200
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,341
Two girls out
for an afternoon of fun.

201
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,928
What do you usually do
with your girlfriends?

202
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,557
I don't know. We go out.
We talk, drink wine.

203
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,434
Can I drink wine?
No.

204
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,352
Some friend.

205
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,773
Well, you can still
talk to me about anything.

206
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,400
Yeah, adults always say that,
but they don't mean it.

207
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:12,945
When my mom says
I can ask her anything,
I really can't.

208
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,947
She just freaks out.

209
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:18,618
I won't freak out.
Shoot.

210
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,620
Okay.

211
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,455
How many men
have you slept with?

212
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:25,082
Eight. Next.

213
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,507
Now can I try it?
No.

214
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,969
I should get one of those.
I've always loved planes.

215
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:41,224
If things had gone
a little differently in my life,
I think I would have been a pilot.

216
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:44,811
Hey, what would happen
if you turned the remote off
and then back on real fast?

217
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,688
Yeah, you'd have been
a great pilot.

218
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:51,317
So, can you do a-
Can you do a loop-de-loop?
If I wanted to.

219
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,486
No way!
Can I try it?

220
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,488
No.

221
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,118
I can see why you like this.
It's so peaceful.

222
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:05,456
It's like the whole world just...
disappears out here.

223
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,086
I remember
this one summer-
I'll tell you what.

224
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,838
There's another trick called
"threading the needle."

225
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,257
I used to do it with Claire
and Mitch when they were kids.

226
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,008
You wanna try it?
How's it go?

227
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,010
You grab one of those
hoops over there...

228
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,848
and go to the far, far,
far end of the field...

229
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,767
and stand there,
and I fly the plane through it.

230
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,562
Um, that sounds awesome!

231
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,605
And then I get a chance flying it?
No.

232
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,066
Okay.
[Clears Throat]

233
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,328
How's this?

234
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,372
Not far enough.
Go on.

235
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,875
- Okay. Further down.
- You can't go too far.

236
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,460
Right.
Okay, I get it. I get it.

237
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,634
How's this?
Good.

238
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,013
Now stand still.
Don't move.

239
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,600
Okay, let's do it.
Whoo!

240
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,269
Whoo! I love it!

241
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,814
I love... it!
[Laughing]

242
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,076
You drove a plane
into my face.

243
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,120
You must have moved.
I told you to stay still.

244
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,122
I didn't move.
Try not to talk.

245
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:31,417
I want to make sure
nothing's broken.
[Groaning]

246
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,838
Alex and I can't just disagree.
I mean, she has to turn
everything into a fight.

247
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,090
Hmm. A strong,
independent woman.

248
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,718
Sounds like
somebody else I know.

249
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,721
I was never hostile though.
I mean, this whole thing
with the dress-

250
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,723
Never had this
problem with Haley.

251
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,935
Maybe Alex doesn't want to
compete with her big sister.

252
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,562
Maybe she's trying to
create her own identity.

253
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,898
Put her in a dress,
and she disappears.

254
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,693
For one afternoon?
I wouldn't give up being
myself for even one second.

255
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,196
Wow.

256
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,823
Sometimes it's hard to remember
you're only 10 years old.

257
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,368
And three-quarters.
Yeah.

258
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,245
[Phone Rings, Beeps]
[Clears Throat]
Hello?

259
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,498
Hey, it's Mitchell.
Do you guys eat olives?
Olives?

260
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,291
Really good olives?
Yeah.

261
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,001
You got it.
[Phone Beeps]

262
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:16,504
Mitchell, I found the diapers.
They're over here.

263
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:18,756
Cameron,
guess what I found?

264
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,009
Coffins.
They sell baby formula
and they sell coffins.

265
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:24,470
You can buy literally
buy everything you need
from birth to death.

266
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,847
Oh, my God.
Look at these diapers.

267
00:13:26,932 --> 00:13:28,808
[Gasps]
Look how cheap they are!

268
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:32,144
Oh. You know what we should do?
We should get enough for
the next year or two, right?

269
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,230
Where would we keep them?

270
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:37,775
They sell sheds.
Really? You want to
buy a diaper shed?

271
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,444
We're those guys now?
The guys with a diaper shed?

272
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,323
Just grab two more.
I'm not grabbing two more,
Mitchell. It's time to go.

273
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,493
Come on, come on.
We need, uh-
Hey, excuse me.

274
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,829
Where did you get that
flatbed thing?
Over there.

275
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,456
Go grab one of those.
Really?

276
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,625
Yeah. Get two.

277
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,380
I'm in the applesauce aisle.

278
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,716
So, anyways, after charades,
we went out for coffee.

279
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,138
And I learned that he loves art.
He plays the piano.
He speaks French.

280
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,474
Un peu.
You see?
I-I misjudged him.

281
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,560
Yeah, I'm sort of
like Costco.

282
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:15,396
I'm big, I'm not fancy,
and I dare you
to not like me.

283
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,606
Yeah, and I'm kinda
more like that, um-

284
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,485
[Sighs]
What is the name of that little
shop we went to in Paris?

285
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:24,113
You are such a snob.

286
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,951
Casablanca.

287
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,912
I have a small flower
on my ankle...

288
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:36,333
and a tiny little butterfly
on my... thigh.

289
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:37,710
How high up?

290
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,755
Pretty high.
Did you do it
to look sexy?

291
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,008
No- Did you do it for a guy?
Does Grandpa like it?

292
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,427
No, no and yes.

293
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,554
That's gross.
Mmm.

294
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,098
Let's go back
to your piercings.
No, no, no.

295
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:55,019
I've answered enough of your questions.
Now it's your turn to answer one.

296
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,812
What is it?

297
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,814
Why you don't want
to wear a dress?

298
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,151
Because I don't want
to look like Haley
and her stupid friends.

299
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,737
I wear dresses
and I don't look like Haley.

300
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:08,115
You are Haley,
just 40 years older.

301
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,533
Ten.
Twenty.

302
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:13,287
Deal. Alex, why are you
fighting me on this?

303
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,832
Just- It doesn't matter
if I dress up. I'm not
pretty like Haley and you.

304
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,919
That's ridiculous!
You're beautiful.
I'm not.

305
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,838
But that's okay.
I'm the smart one.

306
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,384
Mmm. The cute busboy
doesn't know that you're smart.
What?

307
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:30,763
He's been smiling at you every
time he comes to the table.
He does not!

308
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:34,016
Why do you think we are
the only people with bread?

309
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,980
Look. One day you're going to
want to date a cute guy like that.

310
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:43,442
And when that day comes,
you're going to want to look beautiful,

311
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,402
and then you'll wear a dress.

312
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,740
So, you ever
kiss another girl?

313
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:52,660
That's no way to talk
to your grandmother.

314
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,080
Was my mom hard on me
growing up? Yeah, she was.

315
00:15:56,164 --> 00:16:00,960
But you know what? Back then
everything was Betty Friedan
and Gloria Steinem.

316
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,711
[Door Closes]
They didn't understand-

317
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,421
¡Hola! We're back.
[Alex]
Hello.

318
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:07,049
Hey, how'd it go?
It was great.

319
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,426
- Did you have fun with Luke?
- Well, not-

320
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,178
We had a great time.

321
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,890
Alex, I've been thinking, and...

322
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:18,435
if you don't want to wear
a dress to the wedding,
it's not the end of the world.

323
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,564
It's all right.
I bought one.

324
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,566
[Both Laugh]

325
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:26,569
Do you see
how she has to provoke me?
We'll talk about it next week.

326
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,821
[Pounding On Door]
[Jay]
Claire!

327
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,781
Clear the way.
Coming through.
Ow!

328
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,533
Coming through.
Easy. Easy, fella.
Ow!

329
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,743
I need to rest my face.
You're fine.

330
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,078
You'll be all right.
Hang on.

331
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:37,913
Oh, my God!
Get the door.

332
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,081
Ah!
Dad?

333
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,541
Little accident.
Nothing big.

334
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,918
I was in a plane crash.
What happened?

335
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,129
We were threading the needle,
and somebody moved.

336
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,717
- No, I didn't.
You did it on purpose.
- That's the painkiller talking.

337
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,468
He's a little loopy.
[Groaning]

338
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,304
How bad is it?
Well, the wing
is cracked,

339
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,973
- the propeller's bent,
but I can- I can-
- I mean Phil.

340
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,143
I was in a plane crash.
Thanks, Dad.

341
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,395
I didn't ask him to be there.
He insisted.

342
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,397
He took a chance.
This is what happened.

343
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,150
- Kind of like the time
you ran over his foot.
- You ran over his foot?

344
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,360
That was an accident.
You know, Dad,
you did it on purpose.

345
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,322
- We all saw the tire marks
on the lawn.
- I had just quit smoking.

346
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,574
[Phil Groans]
See, you're upsetting
your husband.

347
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,618
Water.
I'll get it.

348
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,039
Ay. You okay?

349
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,209
Gloria!
Thank God you're here.

350
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:25,211
Don't worry.
I'm here too.

351
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,630
Who's this?

352
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,632
Wasn't my fault.
[Scoffs]

353
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,676
I have seen you thread
the needle a million times.
You never miss.

354
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,222
Yeah. I must be getting old.
Why don't you just admit it?
You never liked Phil.

355
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,265
Put that down.
You do not get a cookie.

356
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,394
I like Phil.
It's just that sometimes
he tries too hard, you know?

357
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,064
And it's just kind of-
[Whispering]
Irritating.

358
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,567
Okay, maybe he tries too hard
because you make
zero effort with him.

359
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,903
You know what?
In the 16 years that
we've been married,

360
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,365
have you one time told him
that you liked him?

361
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,742
Not in those
exact words, no.
No.

362
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,329
Not in any words, Dad.
How do you think
that makes me feel?

363
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:04,041
You've never told
your son that you love him?

364
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,585
Whoa, whoa.
When did we jump to love?

365
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,629
And he's technically
not my son.

366
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,091
Ah. So that means that you
don't love Manny either?
Sure, I do.

367
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,636
I mean, believe me,
when I was in that park,
I really wished Manny was there.

368
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,724
For what? So that
you could fly the plane
into his head? Huh?

369
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,061
Dad, thanks so much
for bringing Phil home.

370
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,022
I found one of your little
flaps in his hair. So-

371
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,027
Actually, this is
called an aileron.

372
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,363
It controls the horizontal-
Because that's
what matters right now.

373
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:37,283
Bye, Dad.

374
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,962
- Hey, Phil.
- Jay.

375
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,550
[Groans]
What are you,
made of china?

376
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,927
[Groaning]

377
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:01,098
Phil, I just want you
to know I'm sorry.

378
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,809
And whether I, uh,
missed or you moved-

379
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,687
I didn't.
Either way.

380
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,939
I just want to say
that I like you.

381
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,650
Really?
Yeah.

382
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,736
What do you like about me?

383
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,158
You're a nice guy.

384
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,202
Try real hard.

385
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,330
I do.

386
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,583
And you're a good dad.
Hey, I'm a good dad.
Come here.

387
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,711
Come here, you.
[Groans]

388
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,715
This feels so right.
[Groans]
[Door Opens]

389
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,717
What's going on?

390
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,596
There was a little accident,
but Jay's telling Phil
how much he loves him.

391
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,806
Oh. Well, that's nice
for Phil.

392
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,059
That's great,
since he's never said anything
like that to my boyfriend.

393
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,102
- Let it go.
- No, it's not okay.

394
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,938
No, Mitch is right.
Go in there too, Cam.
Come on.

395
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,607
You're kidding.
Okay.

396
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,317
- Jay!
- I'm gonna get this.

397
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,069
Come on in, Cam.
Just a little hug.

398
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,570
- Get in here.
- Say it.

399
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,906
- [Jay]
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
- Say it! Say it!

400
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,699
I like you too, Cam.
Aw!

401
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,826
What do you like
about him?
Oh, geez.

402
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,453
Where did you get
that camera?

403
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,206
Only the greatest store
on earth.
[Laughs]

404
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,792
[Whispers]
Thanks, Dad.

405
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,418
Manny, picture!
Get in there too.

406
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,670
[Phil]
Get in here, mi amigo.
Oh!

407
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,756
Stay still.
Say "cheese."

408
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,424
Don't push it.
[All]
Cheese!

409
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,550
Picture.

410
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,594
Cheese!
[Gloria]
Cheese. Queso.

411
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,054
[Gloria Laughing]
[Chattering, Laughing]

412
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,598
[Phil]
Oh, boy!
[Laughing Continues]

413
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,226
[Phil]
Doesn't it feel like these arms
could go around the world?

414
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,269
[Cameron Groans]
I think I strained something.

415
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,942
I always wanted a daughter-

416
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,944
to dress her up
in pretty dresses,

417
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,364
do her hair,
her nails, her makeup.

418
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,449
[Laughs]

419
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:45,994
No one knows this, but for
the first year of his life,

420
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,415
I made up Manny like a girl
and told everybody
that he was my daughter.

421
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,417
[Laughs]

422
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,419
Ay, but just
for a few times.

423
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:55,129
I didn't want to mess
with his head.

424
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:59,883
When he found the pictures,
I told him that it was
his twin sister who died.
