00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:02,722
Today, Sam Riley kicked
a soccer ball,

2
00:00:02,847 --> 00:00:05,947
and it hit another kid so hard,
his eye popped out.

3
00:00:06,295 --> 00:00:07,242
Awesome.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,500
Really?
His eye popped out?

5
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:12,011
Well, got to hit the sack.
Big Saturday tomorrow.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,676
That's right.
It's somebody's birthday.

7
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:18,343
Not just that. The iPad comes out
on my actual birthday.

8
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:22,229
It's like Steve Jobs and God got
together to say, "We love you, Phil."

9
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,982
- What's so great about that doohickey?
- "Doohickey," Elly May?

10
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:29,385
It's a movie theater,
a library, and a music store

11
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,525
all rolled into one awesome pad.

12
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:35,191
A library is a place
where people get books.

13
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,662
A movie theater is a place
where people go on dates.

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,748
I'll load the beach chair into
the trunk, for the line in the morning.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,210
Wait, honey, hang on.
You can't spend your birthday in line.

16
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,569
Not the whole day.

17
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:48,631
I have to be there at 6:00, or forget
about it, and then I'm out by 10:00.

18
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:51,717
- Why don't you let me do it?
- Claire, you don't have to do that.

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,761
No, I know, but I want to.

20
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,200
That way, on your birthday, you'll wake
up, and you'll have your brand-new...

21
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,117
toy.

22
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:04,414
In spite of you calling it a toy,
this is shaping up to top

23
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:06,489
the best birthday I ever had.

24
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:09,571
Thank God we didn't have to hear
that stupid story about...

25
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,046
It was called the fun zone.
I was 11.

26
00:01:12,171 --> 00:01:14,569
I hit 10 straight fastballs
in the batting cage.

27
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,034
Then my best friend, Jeff Sweeney,

28
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,992
stepped in
and took one in the groin.

29
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,088
I yelled out, "Ball two!"

30
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:23,919
Everybody laughed.

31
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,085
That was when I knew I was funny.

32
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,971
Good night.

33
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:32,892
B- e-l-i-e-v-e.

34
00:01:33,157 --> 00:01:34,057
Believe.

35
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:36,651
Are you sure there's not
an e-i in the middle?

36
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:37,775
No. It's i-e.

37
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:39,830
Good, <i>papi</i>.
If I can't fool you,

38
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:41,955
then your teachers
can't fool you, either.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,550
They're not trying to fool me.

40
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:46,585
Wait until you see what I got
Phil for his birthday.

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,649
I found it on the Skymall catalog.

42
00:01:48,883 --> 00:01:51,583
It's not one of those
talking alarm clocks?

43
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:55,142
"It's 6:05. It's 6:25.
Wake up. Wake up."

44
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,323
Even better...

45
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,041
A rosewood chess set.

46
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,577
Before I wrap this thing,

47
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,288
what say we take it for a spin?
Manny, I'll teach you.

48
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:04,206
His father taught him how to play.

49
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,794
I'm gonna teach him real chess,
not the Colombian version.

50
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,737
We actually use the pieces
to play the game,

51
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,733
not smuggle stuff
out of the country.

52
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:13,596
I know one Colombian piece
you won't be playing with later.

53
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:16,719
- Manny, let's see what you got.
- You'd be surprised.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,933
Manny's an excellent player.

55
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,901
But Jay is a grumpy loser.

56
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:27,916
He mopes, he makes the face,
he slams the door,

57
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,441
then he said
he didn't slam the door.

58
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:32,423
It's better that he wins.

59
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:39,515
I got this.

60
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:45,836
<i>Everything's gonna be okay.</i>

61
00:02:46,425 --> 00:02:47,425
<i>It's okay.</i>

62
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:49,232
<i>It's okay.</i>

63
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:53,658
Leave me alone.

64
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:56,216
There's a man in Lily's room.

65
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,596
There's a man in Lily's room!

66
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:03,295
It's go time.

67
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:12,191
Oh, thank God.

68
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:15,147
It's me, it's me, it's me.

69
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:18,739
She's fine. We must have just heard
a neighbor with the same monitor.

70
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,157
Thank God.

71
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,582
Boy, if a spider
would've broken in here,

72
00:03:22,707 --> 00:03:24,328
he would've been in trou-ble.

73
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,801
Subtitles by Kevin & Tyno

www.sous-titres.eu

75
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:42,906
Light-up barbecue tongs.

76
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:45,281
This was the lame gift I got Phil.

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,332
So...

78
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,591
Was I bummed to get up
at 5:00 in the morning and wait in line?

79
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,528
No, because I was
finally getting my husband

80
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:55,003
something that
he really, really wanted.

81
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:57,341
I was every bit as excited
as he was.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,346
Hey, buddy. I hope you're not upset
about our chess match yesterday.

83
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,845
- What do you say we play again?
- I'm good.

84
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,413
That's the spirit.

85
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,599
Downloaded this for you.
It's kind of

86
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,417
a kid's guide to chess.

87
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,051
No, Jay. I'm good.

88
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,942
It's not all dry like that.
They have fun with it.

89
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:35,794
See, you can color in the little
players with your crayons.

90
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,986
- You are making me want to play again.
- We're lighting a fire.

91
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,657
Let me toss this out.

92
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:42,032
If you beat me,

93
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,308
if that day should ever come,

94
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:46,209
I'll give you, uh...

95
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,828
Your watch.

96
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,336
Wow. You had that loaded up, huh?

97
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:52,678
Okay. Game on.

98
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,269
Now, I want you to go first.

99
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,376
Now, remember, try to open up
the middle of the board.

100
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:04,218
I'd have moved that guy
two spaces. More aggressive.

101
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:08,200
And you don't want to bring
your queen out that quickly.

102
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,569
You could have protected that with that,
but now you're vulnerable to...

103
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,694
Checkmate.

104
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:14,697
What?

105
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,882
How'd you do that?

106
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,970
You will not believe what's going on
at Jake and Debbie's house.

107
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,616
- Who?
- The people on the monitor.

108
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,984
So much drama.

109
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,742
Jake told Debbie
that he had to work late,

110
00:05:30,867 --> 00:05:33,032
so she called his boss
and found out that he didn't.

111
00:05:33,157 --> 00:05:33,958
Busted!

112
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,418
So she spent all morning
on the phone crying

113
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,975
and crying to her mother

114
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,506
and said if Jake has to
work "late" one more time,

115
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,820
she's filing for divorce.

116
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:44,903
Huh.

117
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,097
I give you that tasty dish,
and all you give me is a "huh"?

118
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,474
I'm s...
Cam, I froze last night.

119
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,542
I froze.

120
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,478
I thought Lily was in danger,
and I froze. But not you.

121
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,396
You sprung right into action.

122
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,607
You even had the cool
"It's go time" line.

123
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,151
That comes to me naturally.
I spent a year as a crossing guard.

124
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:05,531
What kind of parent am I if I can't even
protect my own family?

125
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,497
Just once I would love to be
the guy with no fear

126
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:12,903
who can stand up and...
I don't know, you know, kick some ass.

127
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,346
You're so cute when you're angry
with your little fists.

128
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,662
I just want to put you in my pocket.

129
00:06:19,654 --> 00:06:22,201
- I think he's coming.
- Here he comes.

130
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,382
Dad!

131
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,039
Happy birthday!

132
00:06:25,164 --> 00:06:27,052
You guys, that's awesome.

133
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:30,173
- Who are these from?
- Cam and Mitchell.

134
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:31,733
Those guys are a class act.

135
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,546
We're making you breakfast.

136
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:35,171
French waffle cakes.

137
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,619
Let me guess.

138
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:39,971
One waffle in between
two pieces of French toast,

139
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,469
wrapped in a pancake.

140
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:42,526
Nailed it.

141
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,494
Bring it in here, monkeys.

142
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,027
Love you!

143
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,352
Get over here!

144
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:48,657
Good enough.

145
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,326
- Where's mom?
- The greatest woman in the world?

146
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,138
She is standing in line
at the Apple store,

147
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:56,511
making all my birthday wishes
come true.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,300
Let's see how these bad boys taste.

149
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,623
- That is hot!
- Are you okay?

150
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,839
Fresh out of the oven, eh?
That is...

151
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,591
- Do you want some ice?
- Yes.

152
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,540
Oh, man, this...

153
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,528
Oh, that feels better.
That feels better.

154
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:11,972
No, it actually...

155
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:14,349
feels weird.
That burns in a different way!

156
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:19,188
Don't wash this until we see
if I can get my skin back, okay?

157
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,119
Let me see it!

158
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,899
Your party's not until tonight.
You'll have to wait.

159
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:29,496
Just let me see the bag.
Did you leave it in the car?

160
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:31,533
Who'd you deal with?
Was it a guy named Mehar?

161
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:34,919
They call him "the beast."
Tiny guy. He must move a ton of product.

162
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,382
I kind of love
that you're making me wait.

163
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,166
You are the best wife ever!

164
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,184
You are the best wife ever!

165
00:07:42,221 --> 00:07:43,837
I didn't get you the iPad.

166
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,336
I got to the store, they were all out.
I'm so sorry.

167
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,867
I don't understand.
My online buddies got it.

168
00:07:49,992 --> 00:07:52,106
Sat800 and Brobot
didn't get there until 8:00,

169
00:07:52,231 --> 00:07:55,352
and you definitely got there before 'em,
because you got there at 6:30.

170
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:58,185
You didn't get there at 6:30?
Where were you?

171
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,647
I set the alarm for 5:00.
Got up. Came downstairs. I fell asleep.

172
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,110
Oh, my goodness.
What have I done? What have I done?

173
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,530
- I should've done this myself.
- They're gonna get more in next week.

174
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:13,033
Next week? That's, like, the worst thing
you can say to an early adopter.

175
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,285
Where are you going?

176
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,538
To a place where birthdays
still mean something.

177
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,215
I'll get that.

178
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,718
What are you doing here at...

179
00:08:32,843 --> 00:08:34,914
4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?

180
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,989
I'm just returning
my dad's belt of tools, so...

181
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:40,144
At 4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?

182
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:42,646
Don't you have
something better to do?

183
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,151
- So, were you a big hit?
- What do you mean?

184
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,250
I just assumed it was
some kind of costume party.

185
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,737
Was Cam the Indian?

186
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,376
For your information, dad,

187
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,533
we were doing a little
construction at the house.

188
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,479
- What did you build?
- A gift-wrapping station.

189
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,928
And we're back.

190
00:08:59,164 --> 00:08:59,983
So...

191
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,496
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.

192
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,282
Hey, uh, dad, do you remember
when I was

193
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:08,088
probably 11 and you were teaching me
how to fight, and then I quit?

194
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,508
You said everything you needed to learn,
you'd learned from "West Side Story."

195
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,277
How'd that work out for you?

196
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,470
If I'm ever in a dance fight,
I'll let you know.

197
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:20,189
Is the offer, uh, still good?

198
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,394
What's the matter?
You got problems with Cam?

199
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,980
No! Why would you say that?

200
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,126
Come on. I mean, you know,
sharing a room with a guy?

201
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,736
I bunked with my brother.
I know that can get pretty rough.

202
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,369
I don't "bunk" with Cam.

203
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:34,865
Dad, I just want to learn
a little self-defense.

204
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:36,918
Show me what you remember.

205
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:38,747
Right... right now?

206
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:41,848
Gosh, uh...

207
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,875
- Thumbs out.
- Thumbs... attaboy.

208
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,133
That wasn't very pretty, was it?

209
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,843
Maybe it was a little too pretty.

210
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:57,063
That's the thing.

211
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,400
Here it goes.

212
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:01,912
Buddy,

213
00:10:02,366 --> 00:10:05,361
I think the problem is
you're not jumping from high enough.

214
00:10:06,156 --> 00:10:09,215
- You should get on top of the garage.
- Alex, stop trying to kill Luke.

215
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,569
I need your help. We've got to find
your dad one of those iPad thingies.

216
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,903
So, Haley, text everyone you know.

217
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,448
Alex, Facebook, chat,

218
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,153
tweet, buzz, bling...
Just do what you have to do.

219
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:21,477
We have got to find
one of these iPads, okay?

220
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,584
Luke, that means
stay out of everyone's way

221
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:25,290
and stop inhaling the balloons.

222
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:27,202
I'm not inhaling them.

223
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,377
Stop lying.

224
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,214
How did she know?

225
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,960
Didn't your mama teach you
never to take a ride

226
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:38,887
from a stranger?!

227
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,058
Got a little vacation time
coming up?

228
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:42,681
Have fun on the Moon!

229
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,706
Not feeling too well lately?

230
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:47,656
Maybe you should come
see the doctor, and I'll...

231
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,873
get rid of it!

232
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:53,151
What's that supposed to mean?

233
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:58,092
<i>Attention. If you're here
for Phil's birthday party,</i>

234
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:00,525
<i>they're gathering
in the picnic area.</i>

235
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,250
<i>Phil's birthday party.</i>

236
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,083
My wife knew I'd be here.

237
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,998
She put together
a whole party for me.

238
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,513
Does that really make up
for not getting an iPad?

239
00:11:08,638 --> 00:11:11,272
Don't make me sorry
I shared that with you, okay?

240
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,138
See you, fellas.

241
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:18,905
Howdy do.

242
00:11:19,455 --> 00:11:22,450
I just heard the announcement
for Phil's birthday party.

243
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:24,989
- It's right around the corner.
- Awesome.

244
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,664
- Have fun.
- Thank you. Thanks, milady.

245
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,530
Happy birthday, Phil!

246
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:42,333
This is awesome!

247
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:58,303
<i>Hello?</i>

248
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,469
<i>No, I'm just putting the baby down.</i>

249
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,096
That's Jake.
He's the one having an affair.

250
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,266
- I know.
- <i>Yeah, I can do it tomorrow night.</i>

251
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,734
<i>I'll just give my wife
some excuse.</i>

252
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,147
- Men are pigs.
- <i>I don't really have a choice, do I?</i>

253
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,659
Yeah, you could not cheat on her.
How about that?!

254
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,467
<i>Because it has to be a surprise.</i>

255
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:18,895
<i>When she hears me speaking
Italian to her grandmother,</i>

256
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,208
<i>it'll be worth
all this sneaking around.</i>

257
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,266
Lily, I had it backwards.
He's wonderful.

258
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,412
- <i>I'll just tell her I'm working late.</i>
- No, Jake, don't do that!

259
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,070
- That's the worst thing you could do!
- Buona notte.

260
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,004
Oh, no, what are we gonna do?

261
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,852
We have to fix this.

262
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,897
I'm gonna teach you a couple
of basic Brazilian jujitsu moves.

263
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,403
Now, just...

264
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,001
Just attack me.

265
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:45,292
- I'm sorry. What?
- Take any deep-seated anger you have,

266
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:48,100
- get a running start and come.
- I don't have any deep-seated anger.

267
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,451
Remember that Halloween when I wouldn't
let you go as Olivia Newton-John?

268
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:55,839
You see what I did?
I used your momentum against you.

269
00:12:56,105 --> 00:13:00,109
Learned this from the Gracie brothers.
It's called the lion killer, <i>mata-leao.</i>

270
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,032
Try to get out. Try to get out.
There, you see?

271
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,358
- I can't.
- Yeah.

272
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:07,065
- Alright, now...
- Impressive.

273
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,734
The beauty of this is you don't have
to make the first move.

274
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,526
Chances are, your opponent's
gonna be overconfident.

275
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,895
He's gonna think you don't know a thing.
Basically,

276
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,003
he's being suckered into thinking...

277
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,860
Manny, that little bastard.
He hustled me.

278
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:23,129
Oh, crap.

279
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:25,227
Oh, crap.

280
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:28,765
Oh, crap.

281
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,184
All right, come on.
Yeah, breathe.

282
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:32,718
- Attaboy.
- What?

283
00:13:32,843 --> 00:13:35,981
- You all right? Come around.
- Why am I on the floor?

284
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:42,529
Haley, I just struck out again.
Please tell me you have some good news.

285
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,532
The grove just got in a shipment.
I'm texting you the directions now.

286
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,525
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

287
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,750
That's good.

288
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:52,354
I'm there. I'm on that.

289
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,285
- That kid stole my watch.
- What?

290
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,388
He hustled me at chess.

291
00:14:02,172 --> 00:14:04,009
You promised
you were gonna let him win.

292
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,236
- I did the first time.
- Wait a minute. You're in on it, too?

293
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:10,410
- Go and get dressed for the party.
- Do I have time for a steam?

294
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,281
- Yeah, but a quick one.
- Okay.

295
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:15,837
- Why would you tell him to lose to me?
- 'Cause you're a baby if you don't win,

296
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,710
with the kicking and the eyebrows

297
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,222
and the angry eating
of the sunflower seeds...

298
00:14:21,264 --> 00:14:24,443
Actually, that's not true.
I don't mind losing to a chess genius,

299
00:14:24,568 --> 00:14:26,114
which Manny obviously is.

300
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,533
Chess genius?
He's not even as good as I am.

301
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,785
You're not that good.
I won on our honeymoon.

302
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,786
- Or did I let you win?
- You didn't let me win.

303
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:38,376
Why would I sacrifice my queen
for your pawn, Jay?

304
00:14:44,887 --> 00:14:46,237
Stop saying that.

305
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:54,851
Luke, honey, hi.
What's going on?

306
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,770
The guy came with Dad's cake,

307
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,769
but just so you know,
it's missing a piece.

308
00:14:58,894 --> 00:15:01,062
<i>Did you take a bite
out of your father's cake?</i>

309
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:04,156
- <i>Stop lying, Luke.</i>
- I'm not lying.

310
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:07,739
By the way, I used your credit card
to pay him. Is that all right?

311
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,941
Oh, no.

312
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:12,689
That's fine. Whatever.
That's why I left the wallet there.

313
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:14,516
Oh, my God.

314
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,052
Oh, my God!

315
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,084
I left the wallet.

316
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,585
<i>I left the wa...</i>

317
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,732
Your poor dad.

318
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:25,090
All this running around, and he'll think
nobody cares about him on his birthday.

319
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,408
More cake?

320
00:15:27,097 --> 00:15:28,647
Why not, little Phil?

321
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:30,706
I got no place else to go.

322
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,443
Sir.

323
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:41,388
Sir.

324
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,008
Sir, hi. Excuse me.

325
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,700
Um, yes, I know
this is highly unusual,

326
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:48,313
but I need your help
to save a marriage.

327
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:51,216
A couple in this neighborhood
is about to get a divorce

328
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:54,430
for a simple misunderstanding.
Their name is Jake and Debbie.

329
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,465
And I know you've taken an oath to not
tell people where other people live.

330
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,416
I respect that, but we could work out
some sort of super-secretive spy signal,

331
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:05,468
where if you scratch your left ear,
you know, maybe they live on the left,

332
00:16:05,593 --> 00:16:08,550
- and your right ear, they live on...
- They live right here.

333
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,605
This conversation never happened.

334
00:16:18,142 --> 00:16:21,313
- Sorry.
- Thank God! Thank you, thank you.

335
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,379
- Dad just put me to sleep.
- The hunting story?

336
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,137
Oh, my gosh, no.
You can't cut the line. Sorry.

337
00:16:29,262 --> 00:16:30,357
I was here.

338
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:34,927
I've been here for an hour and a half.
You haven't been, so you cut the line.

339
00:16:35,052 --> 00:16:35,919
Whatever.

340
00:16:36,576 --> 00:16:40,040
Excuse me, sir, you don't understand.
You're not getting in front of us.

341
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,583
Calm down, gingerbread.

342
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,476
Are you gonna move or not?

343
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:49,794
Then you leave me no choice.

344
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:51,343
Oh, my God.

345
00:16:51,763 --> 00:16:52,863
Go to sleep.

346
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:54,665
Go to sleep.

347
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:56,389
- Go to sleep.
- No.

348
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,142
- Go to sleep.
- What are you doing? Get off of him.

349
00:16:59,327 --> 00:17:01,262
- Shut up. He's about to go to sleep.
- No.

350
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,607
- Let's stop it. You three, out of line.
- Sorry, I had nothing to do with this.

351
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:09,030
I'm just waiting in line to get an iPad.
I don't even know this guy.

352
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,370
- I need your credit card.
- He's the problem.

353
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:13,907
- Shut up. You're supposed to be asleep.
- I have it.

354
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,359
- I've got it.
- What?

355
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,048
I've got your card.
I'm good. No, no, I'm good.

356
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:19,635
No, I'm here...

357
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,082
I've got to get my husband an iPad!

358
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,245
Key to a good birthday...
Low expectations.

359
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,964
Thought I was getting an iPad.
I was wrong about that.

360
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,642
Thought I was getting a surprise
party at the batting cages.

361
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,067
Sorry, big Phil.

362
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,766
When it comes right down to it, we're
Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.

363
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,616
Hey, um, Dad,
your cake fell off the counter,

364
00:17:45,741 --> 00:17:47,545
but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.

365
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,670
He won't.

366
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,504
And the pizzas never showed up.

367
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,879
And they won't.

368
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:55,458
Hey, balloons.

369
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,730
- Fine. I guess we'll never know.
- Or we can find out right now, huh?

370
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:01,454
- Manny, give me the chess set.
- Oh, it's a chess set.

371
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:04,534
Yeah. You'll get it later.
We got something to settle. Go in there.

372
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:07,252
- Happy birthday, Phil.
- Happy, happy.

373
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,045
Is it Claire's baked brie I smell?

374
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,463
Cam, you'll never
believe what happened.

375
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:17,375
Happy birthday, Phil.

376
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,332
Sure.

377
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:20,804
You'll never believe it.
I got in trouble for fighting.

378
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,060
- And we saved a marriage.
- Oh, well, this is the best day ever.

379
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,528
- It really is.
- Ain't it, though?

380
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,193
Look at this, papi!
Huh?

381
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:34,656
Easy.

382
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:37,403
You can't sing
"We are the champions"...

383
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:38,978
without your queen.

384
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:43,056
Damn it! Listen, I lose,
and I burn this house down!

385
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:49,127
- Ah, but look at this...
- What are we doing? This is ridiculous.

386
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:53,965
One of us will win the game,
the other will feel lousy, we both lose.

387
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,929
Yeah, just leave my birthday
present on the floor.

388
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,130
That's my girl.

389
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:03,558
She had me.
There was no way I could win.

390
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,478
I knew it. I'm just glad
she didn't know it yet.

391
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,412
Two moves, and then...

392
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,991
I'm a very good chess player.

393
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:12,882
But I'm a better wife.

394
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,400
- Hey, did you get it?
- No.

395
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:20,453
- How's your dad?
- Acting weird... er.

396
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,787
Hey, wife.

397
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:22,912
Honey. Hi.

398
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,206
Um, listen.

399
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:27,329
- Yeah, Luke, hang on one second.
- Honey, it's okay.

400
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:29,147
I don't feel things anymore.

401
00:19:29,272 --> 00:19:31,572
But, sweetie, I want you to feel...

402
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,706
Luke, just a second.
Where are you going?

403
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:36,478
Just heading out to the yard
to get a shovel for my cake.

404
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,551
Luke, what do you want?

405
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,130
I went on Dad's computer,

406
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:44,224
contacted some of his geek friends,
told them that he was dying

407
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:46,434
and his last wish was an iPad.

408
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,478
What have I told you about the...

409
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,796
One of them felt so bad,
they brought over an extra.

410
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,417
Oh, my God.

411
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:56,479
You got it,
you beautiful little liar.

412
00:19:56,604 --> 00:19:57,821
Here comes Dad.

413
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:07,664
Who wants some cake?

414
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,583
I used to, but I don't
desire food any...

415
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,168
Oh, my God! You got it!

416
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,421
All this time, I said I didn't care,
but I do care... I care so much!

417
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,705
- Do you want to blow out the candles?
- Yes.

418
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,754
Go on.

419
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:19,843
Go.

420
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,220
It did not just do that!

421
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,311
- Yes, it did!
- Honey!

422
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,804
Who's ready for the first day
of the rest of their lives?

423
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,048
- Phil, happy birthday.
- Look at this.

424
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,597
- Can I touch it?
- Yeah. Not so hard, but touch it.

425
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:37,652
Touch it, but don't touch it.
Touch it, but don't touch it.

426
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,973
<i>I'm so sorry I ever doubted you.</i>

427
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:43,700
- <i>I love you.
- Thank God that guy came over.</i>

428
00:20:44,153 --> 00:20:47,150
- <i>What did he say his name was?</i>
- <i>He didn't. Must be an angel.</i>

429
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:51,019
- Did you hear that? I'm an angel.
- <i>Or some creepy perv.</i>

430
00:20:52,237 --> 00:20:53,537
<i>How did he know?</i>

431
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,629
- <i>Maybe I should call the police.</i>
- <i>You should.</i>

432
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:02,000
- <i>I'm gonna call the police.</i>
- And they lived happily ever after.

433
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:04,429
No, where are you going?
It was just getting good.

434
00:21:05,369 --> 00:21:07,036
I want...
That's my program.

435
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:09,541
I love you.

436
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,995
I love you, too, honey.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
