Jay, you look so strong and sexy,

Yeah, those will work.

Beautiful.

You can wear them tonight.

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,922
I have a surprise.

Only a vegas legend.

29
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,801
Is he a magician?

30
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,170
'cause I love magicians.

31
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,572
He's a comedian.

00:00:59,607 --> 00:01:00,940
A comedian.

33

It's valentine's day.

34
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,010
I thought we were going salsa dancing,

35
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:05,079
Not to watch a comedian.

36

You're gonna love him.

37
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:08,149
Trust me. The guy's hilarious!

38
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,651
Okay. Tell me one of his jokes.

39
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:12,319
Well, he doesn't do jokes.

40
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:13,554
Does he have a mallet?

41
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:14,855
No.

42
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,390
So, then, how does he get hit in the head?

43
00:01:16,424 --> 00:01:17,959
He doesn't get "hit in the head."

44
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:20,362
He -- he makes observations

45
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:22,664
He tells the truth in a funny way.

46
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:25,969
Come on, he's been on "johnny
carson" a hundred times.

Who the hell is johnny carson?

Oh, for god's sake.

49
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,474
Gloria and I are from different generations,

50
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,408
And I won't lie -- it isn't always easy.

51
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,344
I mean, last week she
thought simon and garfunkel

52
00:01:34,378 --> 00:01:36,045
Were my lawyers.

53
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,346
No, I didn't.

54
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,747
It was a joke.

55
00:01:38,782 --> 00:01:39,948
I don't get it.

56
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:41,984
Maybe that's because there's no mallet.

57
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,354
Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now.

58

Mitchell: Just stay in northern cal--

Oh, that is cute. "cute"?

We spent a lot of time on this. [ chuckles ]

I don't see how.
You just cut up one of your boas.

00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,110
Actually, no, we repurposed it.

71
00:02:09,144 --> 00:02:12,514
It was sort of a "bob mackie
meets martha stewart" project.

00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,749
Okay, well, we just thought
it would be a nice surprise.

Well, it's hardly a surprise.

<i>I mean, you dress her up for every
holiday.</i>

I was giving her a bath last night,

And I still saw traces of martin
luther king behind her ear.

169
00:05:42,641 --> 00:04:25,697
No.

170
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,185
Are these rose petals?

171
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,354
Yes, to commemorate our love.

172
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,588
[ sighs ] I had to settle.

173
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,956
Well, your mom might think so,

174
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,057
But a lot of people think I'm a catch.

175
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,125
No, the case.

176
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,361
<i>I-I was this close to nailing it,</i>

177
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,064
And then my client gets scared and settles.

178
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,566
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,034
Maybe you'd like a chocolate.

180
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,170
Notice that I have not eaten
any of the chocolates.

181
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,906
There were two levels.
You know it, and I know it.

<i>This is so frustrating.</i>

184
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,912
I had one of the greatest
closing arguments of all time --

185
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,749
All about the big government
rolling over the little guy.

186
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:25,417
And I even had this great moment at the end

187
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,952
Where I would point to the state seal

188
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,887
And I'd say, "shame!"

189
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,655
<i>Oh, that's what you were
doing in the shower.</i>

190
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:31,857
I was a little worried.

00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,759
[ doorbell rings ] um, that's manny.

192
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,953
I said we would watch him tonight.
I hope you don't mind.

193
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:38,669
I didn't know you were gonna be going
through all this. No, it's fine.

194
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,104
It might be nice to have him around.

195
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,306
[ chuckles ] he always makes me laugh.

196
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,641
Hi, manny!

197
00:06:43,675 --> 00:06:45,543
The universe is cold and loveless.

198
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,512
[ groans ] uh-oh. Bad valentine's day?

199
00:06:48,547 --> 00:06:49,548
[ sighs ] I went for the gold --

Fiona gunderson.

201
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,251
I poured my heart and soul into a poem,

202
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:54,486
Left it on her desk.

203
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,156
I even burned the edges
to make it look fancy.

204
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,424
And she didn't like it?

205
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,625
Oh, she loved it.

206
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,495
<i>But this kid durkas told
her he wrote it.</i>

207
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:05,263
Well, manny, why didn't
you justell her the truth?

208
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:06,731
She was already gone.

209
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:08,967
<i>And she's on a date with him at my favorite
restaurant,</i>

210
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,201
Great shakes.

211
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:11,336
How do you know all this?

212
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,804
I invited her in the poem.

213
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:14,005
Right after the line of,

214
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,408
"my love is deeper than the great lakes."

215
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,777
Okay, well, this is unacceptable.

216
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:20,578
Oh, here we go. No,
it's not that big of a deal.

217
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:21,780
This is what we're gonna do.

218
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,148
We're gonna shoot over to great shakes,

219
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:24,249
We're gonna get a table,

220
00:07:24,283 --> 00:07:26,117
Manny can reclaim the love of his life.

221
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:27,886
You and I can get a couple mudslides.

222
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,987
I don't know.

223
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:31,089
Durkas is gonna be there.

224
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,024
I've seen the kid do a pull-up.

225
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,093
Hey, manny, it's valentine's day.

226
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,895
It's not the day you run away from love.

227
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:39,464
It's the day you track it down,
tie it up, and take it home.

228
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:41,599
Now, if we can pull this off,

229
00:07:41,634 --> 00:07:43,401
You and your little lady
friend will be belly up

To an ice-cream counter,

David brenner: Thank you. Thank you.

Scientists, they don't
know why this is true,

But it's true.

Did you read about this man --

The 91-year-old bank robber in texas?

243
00:08:10,135 --> 00:08:13,037
He goes into a bank, you know.

"what the hell did I want?"

Specific.

It's a fancy of way of saying
I get things to make noise.

Hmm. Two, please.

In earning a merit badge tonight?

Do you know anything about tying knots?

Why are you here with me?

Because she's always so tired,

And she's always making lists
of things for me to do.

Maybe if you did them,
she wouldn't be so tired.

Oh, no, she can make lists for days.

Why are you here with me?

[ laughter ]

331
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:03,751
In oregon, the state
legislature ratified a bill

332
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,787
That from now on

333
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:09,857
It is a crime to have sex in
oregon with a farm animal.

334
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,459
[ laughs ]

335
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:14,796
How ugly are the women in oregon?

336
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,198
[ laughter ]

337
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,433
He's funny, jay.

338
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,334
[ chuckling ] I know. See?

339
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,770
<i>I can tell -- you're not -- you're not from
oregon. No, no.</i>

340
00:12:22,805 --> 00:12:25,673
You -- you are gorgeous. Thank you.

341
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:28,176
Thank you for bringing
your father to the show.

342
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,711
[ chuckling ] I'm -- I'm her husband, dave.

343
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:32,013
No kidding? Yeah.

344
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,347
What's it like to be married

345
00:12:33,382 --> 00:12:36,150
To someone who was there
when the bible was written?

346
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:38,052
[ laughter ]

347
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:41,055
What was it called then,
just "the testament"?

348
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:42,690
[ chuckles ] [ laughs ]

349
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:44,826
That's -- that's good stuff. [ chuckles ]

350
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,295
Oh, now he's trying to turn out the light.

351
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:50,231
[ laughter ]

352
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,074
[ southern accent ] uh,
yes, hello. Mr. Durkas?

353
00:12:58,109 --> 00:12:59,142
Yeah?

354
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,243
Uh, yeah, this is don jolly

355
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,878
With the great shakes corporate office,

356
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,146
And I have good news for you.

357
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,183
You have been selected to
take part in a random survey

358
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,318
That you could win cash and prizes.

359
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:11,354
Does that sound like something
you'd be interested in?

360
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,722
Yeah. Sure.

361
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,791
Okay, just a few simple questions for you.

362
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,894
Would you please rank
your favorite ice creams

363
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:20,664
At great shakes from least
favorite to favorite?

364
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:22,098
I don't know them by heart.

365
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,401
There should be a menu
right there to your right.

366
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:25,669
To your right.

367
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,671
Mm-hmm. There you go.

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,675
Oh. Hi, manny.

369
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:33,310
Hi, fiona. Can I join you?

370
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,812
I guess so.

371
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:40,550
[ laughter ] and you don't have
to worry about him cheating --

372
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:41,474
That's for sure --

373
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:43,209
Because if he does, you'll catch him

374
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:45,545
When he comes home with two
sets of teeth in his mouth.

375
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,480
Yeah.

376
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:49,882
So, tell me, on the wedding night,
what did he do?

377
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,818
Did he say he wanted to change
into something comfortable

378
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:52,852
And go into a coma?

379
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,620
Ah, ah... [ laughs ]

380
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:56,055
Listen, I got to use the men's room. No.

381
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,957
I got to use -- I'll be right back.

382
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,192
Where you going? Wait a minute.

383
00:13:59,226 --> 00:14:01,027
I'm only joking. That's what I do.

384
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:02,962
<i>You know, you're way
younger than I am.</i>

385
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,864
You just don't look it. [ laughter ]

386
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,039
Clive.

387
00:14:13,073 --> 00:14:15,508
I have a little something for you.

388
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:16,909
What is it?

389
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:19,078
[ inhales sharply ]

390
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:20,379
My dress.

391
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,281
Oh...

392
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:23,516
My bra.

393
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,052
Oh, my g--

394
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,020
My underwear.

395
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,891
My god. Yeah.

396
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:34,660
What do you say we take this upstairs?

397
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,697
This is so much better
than cheesy garlic bread.

398
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,765
Mmm.

399
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,267
Durkas: Chocolate.

400
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,269
Uh-huh. Go on. Vanilla.

401
00:14:43,303 --> 00:14:44,604
I'm taking copious notes.

402
00:14:44,638 --> 00:14:46,672
Keep going, mr. Durkas.

403
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:49,509
So, why would ted say he
wrote the poem if he didn't?

404
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,711
Maybe because you're the
cutest girl in school

405
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:54,547
And you have a laugh that makes
science lab seem like recess.

406
00:14:57,951 --> 00:15:00,408
Would you be more or less inclined

407
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:02,510
To visit a great shakes establishment

408
00:15:02,545 --> 00:15:04,813
<i>If you knew your satisfaction
was guaranteed?</i>

409
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,147
<i>That's a dumb question.</i>

410
00:15:06,182 --> 00:15:08,049
Excuse me, it is not a dumb question,
mister -- [ click ]

411
00:15:08,084 --> 00:15:09,417
Tarnation. He hung up.

412
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,785
Then you can drop the accent.

413
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:14,989
Delgado. What are you doing here?

414
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,157
Discussing poetry.

415
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,460
Maybe you'll like to recite some of yours?

416
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:19,495
I'm not gonna recite anything.

417
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:21,464
Just admit -- you didn't write the poem.

418
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:22,998
I don't know what he's talking about.

419
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,834
Get out of here before
you get your butt kicked.

420
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:27,002
I'm going over there. No, I got this.

421
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:29,071
[ exhales sharply ]

422
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:33,641
Whoa! Whoa! Sir. Sir?

423
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:35,477
Turn around. Sir...

424
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,144
You have no right

425
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:38,113
To claim oership of another person's work.

426
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:39,114
Who are you?

427
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:40,616
I'm a lawyer.

428
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:42,517
You have a lawyer?

429
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:44,086
It is one thing to lie,

430
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,755
But then to bully this young man --

431
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,089
It's unforgivable.

432
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,058
And this is wh wrong with the world today.

433
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:50,925
The big guy...

434
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:57,065
Until the little guy says "enough."

435
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:59,167
And that what this little guy's doing,

436
00:15:59,201 --> 00:16:01,035
Right here, right now.

437
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,637
Could we stop calling me "little guy"?

438
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,872
I'm in the 40th percentile.

439
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:05,273
Shh, I got this. Okay, thank you.

440
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:06,975
Ted durkas...

441
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,644
Clearly did not write that poem.

442
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,880
I know it. He knows it.

443
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:14,382
Deep down in your heart, fiona...

Shame!

Fine! Whatever.

448
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,719
I stole the stupid poem! Fiona: You did?

449
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,987
I told you.

450
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,988
There you go.

451
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,422
I only did it because...

452
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,024
I had the feelings.

453
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,826
I just didn't know how to show them.

454
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,294
Fiona: Really?

455
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,797
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

456
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,699
You've got to be kidding me.

457
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,235
Let's get out of here. This chick's crazy.

458
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,403
Seriously.

459
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,971
I've never seen you like that.

460
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,040
You have no idea how good that felt.

461
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,176
Well, happy valentine's day, counselor.

462
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,579
This is all happening so fast, juliana.

463
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,849
I know. And I have to be home
to my husband by midnight.

00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,283
Ooh, a twist.

No, not now. Seriously, my coat is stuck!

Oh, honey, take off your coat!

Come on up.

You look lovely. So do you.

Not in a weird way.

Hey, tom! Hi.

How are you?

Honey, claire, you remember
tom mickelson from the office,

And his wife, susan. Hi. I do.

Hey. Is your coat stuck?

It is. It really is. Yeah.

It's in there pretty darn good.

495
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,789
[ laughs nervously ] why
don't you take it off?

496
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,791
Um...I'm freezing cold.

497
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:53,093
Well, at least let me give it a shot, okay?

498
00:17:53,127 --> 00:17:54,861
Oh, I don't think -- no,
no, no, no, I got it.

499
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,096
I...

500
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,764
Mr. And mrs. Dunphy? Hey!

501
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,434
Principal balaban! Hey. How are you?

502
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:02,903
Hi. Who's, uh, clive bixby?

503
00:18:02,937 --> 00:18:04,504
Oh. Uh...

504
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:05,806
He makes speakers.

505
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,808
He's actually in town
for a trade show. Phil.

506
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,110
Oh...My. Are you stuck?

507
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:11,878
Yeah, I am. A...Little bit.

508
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:13,313
Why don't you take off that coat?

509
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:14,648
Um, I'm chilly.

510
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,450
It's really jammed in here.

511
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:18,885
Let me -- oh, no, I think we're okay.

512
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,221
Mrs. Dunphy! Claire: Oh!

513
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:23,056
Are you kidding me?!

514
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,424
Hi!

515
00:18:24,459 --> 00:18:26,426
Luke's math teacher, miss passwater!

516
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:28,295
[ chuckling ] "passwater."

517
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,664
Oh, jay, papi.

518
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:32,732
Don't pay attention to what he's saying.

519
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,867
He's just being funny.

520
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,602
Because he points out the truth.

521
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,405
Those people were laughing
because they saw it, too.

522
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,840
What do you care what they think?

523
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:40,841
I don't.

524
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,009
<i>I care what you think.</i>

525
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,578
I love you. You're my valentine.

526
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:45,579
Yeah, for now.

527
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,080
But what about when I'm 80

528
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:48,815
And I' a wheelchair, on oxygen?

529
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,250
You still gonna want me?

530
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:51,651
Do you think I'm so shallow

531
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:53,553
That I'm gonna leave you when you're old?

532
00:18:53,588 --> 00:18:56,012
What if I gain 100 pounds?
You gonna leave me then?

533
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:58,414
No!

534
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:00,449
What's with the pause?!

535
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,784
Well, it's not exactly fair.

536
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,654
I mean, I have to get old.
You don't have to get fat.

537
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,255
If I want to get fat, I get fat.

538
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,357
Okay, fine. And if you do,
I'll be there. You'll see.

539
00:19:08,392 --> 00:19:11,127
Oh, yeah, watch me. Watch me how I get fat!

540
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:12,929
I can get fat.

541
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,297
And I'll be there.

542
00:19:14,331 --> 00:19:15,464
Mm.

543
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,499
[ chuckles ]

544
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:18,134
Good.

545
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:20,036
You want to go back in? No.

546
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,437
I got a better idea.

547
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,072
Let's go salsa dancing.

548
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:24,774
This guy's not that funny.

549
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:25,842
[ gasps ]

550
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,009
Perfect.

551
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:28,044
[ chuckles ]

552
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:29,478
We're good! We're good!

553
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,080
I talked to maintenance.

554
00:19:31,114 --> 00:19:33,316
They're -- they're coming, so go on ahead.

555
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,984
Oh. [ sighs ] phil: See you guys.

556
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,652
See you later. See you at school?

557
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:37,720
Good to see you guys.

558
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:39,288
Maintenance is gonna take care of it.

559
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:40,790
So we're fine. Okay.

560
00:19:40,824 --> 00:19:42,124
Okay, how long till they get here?

561
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:44,160
I was faking it. No one's coming for us.

562
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:46,295
Well, then, go and get them!

563
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,632
Hurry! That was the most
embarrassing moment of my life!

564
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,868
Claire! Phil!

565
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:53,102
Stand by.

566
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:55,705
Phil: Hey.

567
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,340
What, did you get your belt stuck?

568
00:19:57,374 --> 00:19:59,208
I did. Yeah. Yeah.

569
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:00,877
Well, take your coat off.
Here, let me help you.

570
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:02,745
No, no, dad, dad...

571
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,480
Come on, what are you, naked under there?

572
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:07,016
Oh, geez.

573
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,417
It's okay.

574
00:20:08,452 --> 00:20:09,886
I got this.

575
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,454
O...Kay.

576
00:20:11,488 --> 00:20:15,845
Claire, follow my lead, okay? Claire: Okay.

577
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,114
Okay.

578
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,289
Claire: Wow. Okay.

579
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,058
Thank you.

580
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,694
It has happened to me before. [ chuckles ]

581
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,495
That was impressive.

582
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,332
Take it down a notch, "clive."

583
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:36,867
You okay?

584
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,935
Claire: Yeah, I'm good.

585
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,804
All right. Happy valentine's day.

586
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,239
Claire: Happy valentine's day.

587
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,608
See ya. Bye. Good night.

588
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,609
Oh.

589
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,944
[ gloria chuckles ] sorry.

590
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,579
See you guys.

591
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:54,022
Phil: Hey. I just wanted to tell you how
great you were last night.: Hi, honey.

592
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,257
Uh, phil...

593
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,759
Sorry I got the, um,

594
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:58,727
Sweetie --

595
00:20:58,761 --> 00:20:59,995
<i>They're not our sheets, right?</i>

596
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,229
[ both laugh ]

597
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:03,198
Honey, honey, remember
when the salesman told us

598
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,701
That the sienna was built with
the whole fami in mind? Yeah.

599
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:08,370
<i>Well, the whole family
just heard that.</i>

600
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:10,906
Uh, well, I guess...

601
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,574
I guessthe bluetooth works.

602
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,842
Mm.

603
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:15,777
Why did you have oil?

604
00:21:15,812 --> 00:21:19,715
Because, buddy, we were making french fri!

605

In your room?
