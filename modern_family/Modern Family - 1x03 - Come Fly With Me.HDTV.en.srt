00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:10,501
{\pos(192,235)}Honey, I thought you were gonna
take out the garbage.

2
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,669
Getting it.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,345
I was gonna get it.

4
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:27,703
- Dylan.
- Hey, Mrs. Dunphy.

5
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:31,409
- I'm just waiting for Haley.
- Did you ring the bell?

6
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:34,276
I texted. She said
she'd be down in just a minute.

7
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,036
- Oh, great. Tell her I said hi.
- I will.

8
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,443
D-Money!

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,832
Chillin' with Dylan the villain.

10
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,346
- "D" to the "y" to the...
- Hey, Mr. Dunphy.

11
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,047
{\pos(192,210)}Come on in. You're just in time
to catch the end of the game.

12
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,172
{\pos(192,210)}I'm not really a baseball guy.

13
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:52,103
- Haley says hi.
- I was just being facetious.

14
00:00:52,228 --> 00:00:53,844
I'll catch you up.

15
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,454
Sit it. Park it.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,474
Come on, I don't bite.

17
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:01,847
Kidding.

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,143
I'm kidding.

19
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,839
{\pos(192,225)}Okay, see that guy? He's the tying run.
Interesting story about him.

20
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,071
{\pos(192,225)}He's been stuck
on second base forever,

21
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:11,705
{\pos(192,225)}and I'm pretty sure
he's gonna try and steal third,

22
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:15,783
{\pos(192,225)}which is justa terrible, terrible idea.
How are you and Haley doing?

23
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:25,138
I wish I could stay home
with you and fly toy airplanes.

24
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:28,671
{\pos(192,225)}These aren't toy airplanes. These are
models, and they're very complicated.

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,158
{\pos(192,225)}You want to fly one of these,
you got to be familiar with airfoil,

26
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:35,928
drag, lift, and thrust, and these
are all principles of aerodynamics.

27
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,133
The box says, "12 and up."

28
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,890
What?!

29
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:44,795
{\pos(192,225)}You can fly planes with Jay next time.
Today you have to spend time with Luke.

30
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,696
{\pos(192,225)}- Why?
- His mother invited you, so you go.

31
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:49,775
{\pos(192,225)}Family needs to be close,
right, Jay?

32
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,089
I'm pretty sure this is a typo.

33
00:01:52,336 --> 00:01:55,197
<i>Men need their hobbies.
Manny's father had many hobbies,</i>

34
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,555
like hiking in the desert,

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,119
that kind of skiing
that they drop you from the...

36
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,339
- How do you say in english? The...
- Helicopter.

37
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,117
Once, on a dare,
he even boxed with an alligator.

38
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,025
Wrestle.
You wrestle.

39
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,518
- You can't box with alligators.
- Are you sure?

40
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:14,925
How would they get the gloves
on those little claws?

41
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,726
Aren't they like tiny, little hands?

42
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,265
- I forgot what we were talking about.
- Anyways,

43
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:23,918
hobbies are important for the men,

44
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,906
whether you're risking your life

45
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,831
or flying little planes
from a safe distance.

46
00:02:33,098 --> 00:02:35,571
- Wait, what are you doing?
- We're gonna buy some diapers.

47
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,186
It'll just take a second.

48
00:02:37,464 --> 00:02:38,610
This is Costco.

49
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,665
Yeah, which is where we buy diapers.

50
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,782
Since when?

51
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:44,788
Do you rember when we adopted
that baby a few months back?

52
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:45,963
Since then.

53
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,237
Mitchell is a snob.

54
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,457
No, I'm discerning.

55
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,508
Official slogan for snobs.

56
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,560
When we first met, he wouldn't even
look at me because I was

57
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:02,185
a hick from the farm in Missouri
and he's a big city mouse.

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,951
Who says "city mouse"?

59
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:06,226
Country mice.

60
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,899
I think I'm gonna
go wait in the car.

61
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,443
On your way out,
can you grab the garbage?

62
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:16,824
- I got it.
- Okay, we got it.

63
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,084
- He's a little jumpy.
- Go figure.

64
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,067
A teenage boy doesn't want to hang out
with his girlfriend's dad.

65
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,163
I thought we were past all that.
I'm all about...

66
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:28,521
I'm all about taking it
to the next level.

67
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:29,521
Really?

68
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,752
I thought you were all about
keeping it real.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,876
The whole point of keeping it real
is so you can take it to the next level.

70
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:36,256
Did you not know that?

71
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,051
You haven't exactly taken it
to the next level with my dad.

72
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:42,261
- What are you talking about?
- We've been married for 16 years,

73
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,632
and you still walk on eggshells
around him.

74
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,557
What?!

75
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,025
Are you kidding?

76
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:49,299
Jay and I are total buds.

77
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,582
You want to just hang out?

78
00:03:56,263 --> 00:03:58,613
Brought six friends, so that just...

79
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:00,856
Let's...

82
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,923
Manny brought his favorite game
to play with Luke.

83
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,450
It's called "Empire."

84
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:22,594
You use strategy to expand territories
and take over the world.

85
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:25,808
{\pos(192,180)}Luke is gonna love that.
He's out back playing.

86
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,193
Do you need me to get you something
while I'm out shopping?

87
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:30,477
That's such a nice offer,
but I think we're good. Thanks.

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,771
What about this?

89
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:35,065
You don't even say hello
to Gloria and Manny?

90
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,689
Hi, Gloria and Manny.

91
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:39,860
- Okay, mom, what about this?
- No, you're wearing a dress.

92
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,496
Mom, come on!

93
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,157
{\pos(192,210)}What? It's gonna kill you to look
like a girl for one afternoon?

94
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,116
{\pos(192,180)}It's a wedding for some friend of yours
that I never even heard of.

95
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:50,535
{\pos(192,180)}It's non negotiable.
You can borrow a dress of Haley's again.

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,610
That sends an ugly message...

97
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,113
That I'm Haley.

98
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,991
You know, instead of trying
to force me to wear a dress,

99
00:04:57,116 --> 00:04:59,589
why don't you worry about
getting Luke to wear some pants?

100
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:01,787
{\pos(192,280)}What?

101
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,344
Why does he do this?

102
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:08,974
Pants! Come on!

103
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,729
{\pos(192,210)}<i>Jay and I are buds, for sure,</i>

104
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,930
but with kind of
an invisible asterisk.

105
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:22,208
He's not, uh...
He's not a talker...

106
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,068
or a hugger.

107
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,034
Once, he ran over my foot
with his car.

108
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,470
To be fair,
he had just given up smoking.

109
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,445
But, basically, we're buds.

110
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:38,420
{\pos(192,210)}Do you have to just stand there?
You're making me feel uneasy.

111
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:44,134
Oh, for God's sake, sit here.

112
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,102
{\pos(192,210)}Hold this wing like this
while I adjust this.

113
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,069
Come on. Here.

114
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:01,778
Not too hard.

115
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,425
{\pos(192,210)}Why don't you come shopping with me?

116
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,939
{\pos(192,210)}Maybe I can help you find
something that you like.

117
00:06:10,064 --> 00:06:12,746
That's a really nice offer,
but it's not really her thing.

118
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:15,081
Actually, I'd love to go.

119
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:18,877
See, you don't know what my thing is.
You have no idea what my thing is.

120
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,286
{\pos(192,210)}I know what your thing is.
Your thing is to provoke,

121
00:06:22,411 --> 00:06:24,975
{\pos(192,210)}just like your sister's thing
is to never come out of her room,

122
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,635
{\pos(192,210)}and your brother's thing...
Well, there's your brother's thing.

123
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:31,656
Put 'em on!

124
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,518
<i>The thing about me and Jay is</i>

125
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,689
our relationship's always been stuck

126
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,264
in that primal place
where it started.

127
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,839
You know, he's the old silverback
protecting his females.

128
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,347
Then along comes this younger,
stronger gorilla,

129
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,428
swinging in, beating his chest.

130
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:50,040
Naturally,
the ape ladies come running,

131
00:06:50,165 --> 00:06:52,211
presenting
their nice scarlet behinds.

132
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:55,176
Papa ape wants to stop all that,
but he can't.

133
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:56,894
That's... that's life.

134
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,419
I'm not the enemy.

135
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,357
The enemy is poachers.

136
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:07,587
That'll do it.

137
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:09,137
Don't touch it.

138
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,724
All right.

139
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,023
- You want to go fly it?
- Sure.

140
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:28,653
I got the toothpaste and the soap.

141
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:31,347
Good. Now we can open
that general store.

142
00:07:31,472 --> 00:07:34,157
- We were just here to get diapers.
- We had a saying on the farm.

143
00:07:34,282 --> 00:07:38,272
If you bring the mule to the market...
I feel you rolling your eyes at me.

144
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:41,516
We met at one of Pepper's
legendary game nights.

145
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:43,958
I remember Mitchell
because he kept rolling his eyes

146
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,915
- every time I would get boisterous.
- I did not!

147
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,190
A little bit.

148
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,433
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

149
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,404
We were playing charades, and
I had no idea how to act out my clue,

150
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,929
and all I could think of
to do was...

151
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:01,404
- Without missing a beat, Cam says...
- "Casablanca."

152
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:04,822
- All I did was this...
- "Casablanca."

153
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:06,722
"Casablanca."

154
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,068
Can we get the diapers
and get out of here?

155
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:11,489
Fine, but I want to stop by
the wine section first.

156
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:14,200
Wait. There's a wine section?

157
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,185
Yeah, a really good one.
Just past the tires.

158
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,160
No way, they do not have...

159
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,660
Oh, my God.

160
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,391
Oh, my... Cam. Cam.

161
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,710
The paper shredder I wanted, huh?
Confetti and crosscut.

162
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:30,677
Oh, my God, amazing.

163
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:38,377
What is this place?

164
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,480
Those cookies smell like heaven.
Your own recipe?

165
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,441
No, I just throw them in the oven.

166
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,569
And added the secret ingredient
of caring?

167
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:50,906
Sure.

168
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,580
So, you and Luke having a good time?

169
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,950
I don't know.
He won't come out of his box.

170
00:08:56,985 --> 00:09:00,350
Maybe I'll just stay here and
spend some time with my sister.

171
00:09:00,653 --> 00:09:03,624
Right, I guess, technically,
I would be your stepsister.

172
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,313
My mother says we are never
to use the word "step"

173
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:09,630
because it means "not real,"
and we are a real family.

174
00:09:11,306 --> 00:09:13,356
So, what is the matter, Claire?

175
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:15,761
What?

176
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,079
You seem sad.

177
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,908
It's just stuff with Alex.
You know, kid stuff.

178
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:23,144
Ugh, kids.

179
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,314
You don't have to tell me.
My school is full of them.

180
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:32,194
I was thinking, after lunch,
we can go and do a little shopping.

181
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,823
- I'm not getting a dress.
- I don't care. I'm not your mother.

182
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,951
- I know. You're my grandmother.
- Step-grandmother.

183
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,989
Anyways, today,
think of me as a girlfriend.

184
00:09:43,114 --> 00:09:46,065
Two girls out
for an afternoon of fun.

185
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,970
What do you usually do
with your girlfriends?

186
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,548
I don't know. We go out.
We talk,

187
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,167
- drink wine.
- Can I drink wine?

188
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:57,704
Some friend.

189
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,972
You can still
talk to me about anything.

190
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,601
Yeah, adults always say that,
but they don't mean it.

191
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:07,408
When my mom says I can ask her anything,
I really can't.

192
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,033
She just freaks out.

193
00:10:09,728 --> 00:10:11,128
I won't freak out.

194
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:12,487
Shoot.

195
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,425
- How many men have you slept with?
- Eight. Next.

196
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:25,825
Now can I try it?

197
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:31,128
I should get one of those.
I've always loved planes.

198
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,340
If things had gone differently
in my life, I would have been a pilot.

199
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,865
What would happen if you turned the
remote off and then back on real fast?

200
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,540
Yeah, you would have been
a great pilot.

201
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,577
So, can you do a loop-de-loop?

202
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:47,372
- If I wanted to.
- No way! Can I try it?

203
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:54,755
I can see why you like this.
It's so peaceful.

204
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,688
It's like the whole world just...

205
00:10:57,813 --> 00:10:59,313
disappears out here.

206
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,709
- I remember this one summer...
- I'll tell you what.

207
00:11:04,834 --> 00:11:08,298
There's a trick, "threading the needle."
Claire and Mitch played at it as kids.

208
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:10,042
- You wanna try?
- How does it go?

209
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,042
You grab one of those hoops
over there

210
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,136
and go to the far, far, far end
of the field

211
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,958
and stand there,
and I fly the plane through it.

212
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:21,356
That sounds awesome!

213
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:24,104
And then I get a chance flying it?

214
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,192
How's this?

215
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,197
Not far enough.
Go on.

216
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:41,598
Further down.

217
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,369
- You can't go too far.
- Right, okay. I get it. I get it.

218
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:52,543
- How's this?
- Good!

219
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:54,467
Now stand still!

220
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:55,642
Don't move!

221
00:11:56,147 --> 00:11:57,310
Let's do it!

222
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:01,908
I love it!

223
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,347
I love...

224
00:12:03,684 --> 00:12:04,484
it!

225
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:17,017
- You drove a plane into my face.
- You must have moved.

226
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:19,293
- I told you to stay still.
- I didn't move!

227
00:12:19,418 --> 00:12:22,668
Try not to talk. I want to make sure
nothing's broken.

228
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:27,571
{\pos(192,205)}Alex and I can't just disagree.
She has to turn everything into a fight.

229
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,390
{\pos(192,205)}A strong, independent woman.

230
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,559
{\pos(192,205)}Sounds like somebody else I know.

231
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,973
{\pos(192,205)}I was never hostile, though.
This whole thing with the dress...

232
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,015
{\pos(192,205)}Never had this problem with Haley.

233
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,903
Maybe Alex doesn't want
to compete with her big sister.

234
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,529
Maybe she's trying
to create her own identity.

235
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:47,132
- Put her in a dress and she disappears.
- For one afternoon.

236
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,407
I wouldn't give up being myself
for even one second.

237
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,563
Sometimes it's hard to remember
you're only 10 years old.

238
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:56,138
And three-quarters.

239
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,195
- <i>It's Mitchell. Do you need olives?</i>
- Olives?

240
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:03,989
- <i>Really good olives.</i>
- Yeah.

241
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:05,319
You got it.

242
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:08,542
Mitchell, I found the diapers.
They're over here.

243
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,494
Cameron, guess what I found.

244
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,680
Coffins.

245
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:14,072
They sell baby formula,
and they sell coffins.

246
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:17,127
You can literally buy everything
you need from birth to death.

247
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:20,915
Look at these diapers.
Look how cheap they are!

248
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,668
We should get enough for like
the next year or two, right?

249
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:25,543
Where would we keep them?

250
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:29,640
- They sell sheds.
- Really? You want to buy a diaper shed.

251
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,100
We're those guys now?
The guys with the diaper shed?

252
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:35,937
- Just grab two more.
- I'm not grabbing two more. Time to go.

253
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,522
Come on. We need a...

254
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:41,136
Excuse me. Where did you
get that flatbed thing?

255
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,137
- Over there.
- Go grab one of those.

256
00:13:43,262 --> 00:13:45,112
- Really?
- Yeah. Get two.

257
00:13:49,212 --> 00:13:50,971
I'm in the applesauce aisle!

258
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,385
So, anyways, after charades,
we went out for coffee,

259
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,628
and I learned that he loves art,

260
00:13:55,753 --> 00:13:58,710
he plays the piano,
he speaks French.

261
00:13:58,878 --> 00:13:59,728
<i>Un peu.</i>

262
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,029
So, you know, I misjudged him.

263
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,122
I'm sort of like Costco.

264
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:07,163
I'm big, I'm not fancy,
and I dare you to not like me.

265
00:14:07,288 --> 00:14:09,137
And I'm kind of more like that...

266
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,717
What is the name of that little shop
we went to in Paris?

267
00:14:13,842 --> 00:14:15,342
You are such a snob.

268
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,610
"Casablanca."

269
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:23,500
I have a small flower on my ankle

270
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,025
and a tiny,
little butterfly on my...

271
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:27,677
Thigh.

272
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,180
How high up?

273
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,495
Very high.

274
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:33,995
Did you do it to look sexy?
No, did you do it for a guy?

275
00:14:34,163 --> 00:14:35,455
Does grandpa like it?

276
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,352
No, no, and yes.

277
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,151
That's gross.

278
00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:42,269
Let's go back to your piercings.

279
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:46,424
I've answered enough of your questions.
Now it's your turn to answer one.

280
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,150
What is it?

281
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,250
Why you don't want to wear a dress?

282
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,515
Because I don't want to look
like Haley and her stupid friends.

283
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,053
I wear dresses,
and I don't look like Haley.

284
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,378
You are Haley,

285
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,521
just... 40 years older.

286
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:00,897
- 10.
- 20.

287
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:01,942
Deal.

288
00:15:02,437 --> 00:15:05,976
- Alex, why are you fighting me on this?
- It doesn't matter if I dress up.

289
00:15:06,101 --> 00:15:08,196
I'm not pretty like Haley and you.

290
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,296
- That's ridiculous! You're beautiful!
- I'm not.

291
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,721
But that's okay.

292
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:14,202
I'm the smart one.

293
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:17,706
The cute busboy doesn't
know that you're smart.

294
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:18,674
What?

295
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,938
He's been smiling at you every
time he comes to the table.

296
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:25,163
Why do you think we are
the only people with bread?

297
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,507
Look, one day,

298
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:31,261
you are going to want
to date a cute guy like that.

299
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:34,681
When that day comes,
you're gonna want to look beautiful,

300
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:36,641
and then you'll wear a dress.

301
00:15:39,196 --> 00:15:40,979
So, you ever kiss another girl?

302
00:15:41,652 --> 00:15:43,898
That's no way to talk
to your grandmother.

303
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:46,219
Was my mom hard on me growing up?

304
00:15:46,344 --> 00:15:48,536
Yeah, she was, but you know what?

305
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:52,209
Back then, everything
was Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.

306
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,648
- They didn't understand...
- <i>Hola.</i> We're back.

307
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:57,024
How'd it go?

308
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:59,622
It was great.
Did you have fun with Luke?

309
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:02,333
- Well, not...
- We had a great time.

310
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:05,443
Alex, I've been thinking, and...

311
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,591
If you don't want to wear a dress,
it's not the end of the world.

312
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:11,377
It's all right.

313
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:13,324
I bought one.

314
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,677
- Do you see how she has to provoke me?
- We'll talk about it next week.

315
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:23,420
Clear the way.
Coming through. Easy.

316
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,857
- I need to rest my face.
- You're fine.

317
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,260
You'll be all right.

318
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,044
Oh, my God!

319
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,654
- Dad!
- Little accident. Nothing big.

320
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:34,131
- I was in a plane crash.
- What happened?

321
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:36,524
We were threading the needle,
and somebody moved.

322
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:39,314
No, I didn't.
You did it on purpose.

323
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:42,363
That's the painkiller talking.
He's a little loopy.

324
00:16:42,609 --> 00:16:44,636
- How bad is it?
- The wing is cracked,

325
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:47,045
- the propeller's bent, but I can...
- I mean Phil.

326
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,863
I was in a plane crash.

327
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,088
Thanks, dad.

328
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,724
I didn't ask him to be there.
He insisted.

329
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:56,012
- He took a risk. This is what happened.
- Like the time you ran over his foot?

330
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,084
- You ran over his foot?
- That was an accident.

331
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,892
You did it on purpose.
We all saw the tire marks on the lawn.

332
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,529
I had just quit smoking.

333
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:06,335
- See, you're upsetting your husband.
- Water.

334
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:11,128
You okay?

335
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:14,237
Gloria.
Thank God you're here.

336
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,379
Don't worry. I'm here, too.

337
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,686
Who's this?

338
00:17:19,107 --> 00:17:20,407
Wasn't my fault.

339
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:22,908
I have seen you thread
the needle a million times.

340
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,126
- You never miss.
- I must be getting old.

341
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:27,398
Why don't you just admit it?
You never liked Phil.

342
00:17:27,523 --> 00:17:29,170
Put that down.
You do not get a cookie.

343
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:33,294
I like Phil. It's just that sometimes
he tries too hard, you know?

344
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,985
And it's just kind of...
Irritating.

345
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,298
Maybe he tries too hard
because you make zero effort with him.

346
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:41,682
You know what?
In the 16 years we've been married,

347
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,700
have you one time told him
that you liked him?

348
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,270
- Not in those exact words, no.
- No, not in any words, dad.

349
00:17:49,491 --> 00:17:51,841
How do you think that makes me feel?

350
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,419
You've never told your son
that you love him?

351
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,780
When did we jump to "love"?

352
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:01,838
- And he's technically not my son.
- That means that you don't love Manny?

353
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:04,712
Sure I do.
Believe me, when I was in that park,

354
00:18:04,837 --> 00:18:06,415
I really wished Manny was there.

355
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:10,125
For what? So that you could
fly the plane into his head?

356
00:18:11,983 --> 00:18:14,683
Dad, thanks so much
for bringing Phil home.

357
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,718
I found one of your little flaps
in his hair.

358
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:25,185
- Actually, this is called an aileron.
- 'Cause that's what matters right now.

359
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,037
Bye, dad.

360
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,205
What, are you made of China?

361
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:51,156
I just want you to know, I'm sorry.

362
00:18:51,957 --> 00:18:54,492
And whether I missed or you moved...

363
00:18:54,617 --> 00:18:56,517
- I didn't.
- Either way...

364
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,535
I just want to say that I like you.

365
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,510
Really?

366
00:19:02,431 --> 00:19:04,231
What do you like about me?

367
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,054
You're a nice guy.

368
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,239
You try real hard.

369
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:13,871
I do.

370
00:19:15,301 --> 00:19:18,154
- You're a good dad.
- I am a good dad. Come here.

371
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,020
Come here, you.

372
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,199
This feels so right.

373
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,684
- What's going on?
- There was a little accident,

374
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:31,125
but Jay's telling Phil
how much he loves him.

375
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,335
Well, that's nice for Phil.

376
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,110
That's great, since he's never said
anything like that to my boyfriend.

377
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:38,070
- Let it go.
- It's not okay.

378
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:40,468
Mitch is right.
You go in there, too, Cam. Come on.

379
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,128
You're kidding.

380
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,940
Come on in, Cam.

381
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:47,300
- A little hug?
- Get in here.

382
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:49,251
Say it, say it!

383
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,140
I like you, too, Cam.

384
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,272
- What do you like about him?
- Oh, geez.

385
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:57,495
- Where did you get that camera?
- Only the greatest store on earth.

386
00:19:58,088 --> 00:19:59,188
Thanks, dad.

387
00:19:59,796 --> 00:20:01,864
Manny, picture.
Get in there, too.

388
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,958
Get in here, <i>mi amigo</i>.

389
00:20:04,314 --> 00:20:06,202
Stay still. Say, "cheese!"

390
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,328
Don't push it.

391
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:08,996
- Cheese!
- Picture!

392
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:10,926
Cheese! <i>Queso</i>!

393
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:14,547
- How beautiful!
- Oh, boy!

394
00:20:14,953 --> 00:20:17,962
Doesn't it feel like his arms
could go around the world?

395
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:20,037
I think I strained something.

396
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,104
{\pos(192,220)}I always wanted a daughter.

397
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,269
{\pos(192,220)}To dress her up in pretty dresses,
do her hair,

398
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,760
{\pos(192,220)}her nails, her makeup.

399
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:35,248
{\pos(192,220)}No one knows this, but for
the first year of his life,

400
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:39,535
I made up Manny like a girl and told
everybody that he was my daughter.

401
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:42,565
But just for a few times.

402
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,490
I didn't want to mess with his head.

403
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:48,817
When he found the pictures, I told him
that it was his twin sister who died.

9999
