00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,634
Guess who's here.
Your dad!

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,388
[Chuckles]
He drove his R.V. All
the way up from Cocoa Beach.

5
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,765
Hey, Son, working hard?

6
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,893
He's gonna say
"Hardly working."
[Chuckles]

7
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:20,854
I meant to tell you
he was driving out.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,731
Did he say it?
Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,193
- Good kid.
- He wasn't supposed to
show up for a few more days.

10
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,945
Well, guess what he brought us.

11
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,615
A dog... to keep.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,867
Yes! Yes.

13
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:38,163
Yes, I should have told
Claire about the dog,
and I was going to.

14
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,957
But I was just waiting for her
to be in the right mood.

15
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,003
Actually, I did get one right mood
a couple nights ago,

16
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,590
but I cashed that in
for something else.

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:53,386
- Am I in trouble?
- Oh, really, really big.

18
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,139
Okay, I'm a little scared.
How bad is this?
Oh, well-

19

We have a new rule-
no sleeping in the bedroom.

Mr. Pritchett.
Uh, Ben- Ben Dugan.

21
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,362
I went to high school with Mitch.
We were in the drama club together.

22
00:01:10,446 --> 00:01:12,155
That's right.
Yeah.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,741
Geez, I didn't
recognize you without
that old-guy makeup on.

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,452
You know, you and Mitch
knocked The Sunshine Boys
out of the park.

25
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:20,455
Mitch was really great in that.
I always thought he should be an actor.

26
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,250
Yeah, he's got a real job now.
He's a lawyer. How about you?

27
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:26,127
Still acting.
Fantastic.

28
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,047
Actually, it's exciting. I'm in a new movie,
Maple Drive. Just came out.

29
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,591
You're kidding me. Look at me.
I know somebody famous.

Uh, anyway, I got to go.

Great to see you.
Good to see you too.
Yeah.

Hey, how'd it go in there?
No cavities.

34
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,062
And I got a free toothbrush.
Hey, you want to
go to the movies?

35
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:46,731
I just heard about a good one.
But I'm supposed to be
in school.

36
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:49,109
Well, you're supposed to
floss too, but you got
away with that one.

Come on. Let's go.

[Jay]
One of the greatest days of my life...

39
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,992
was when my old man
sprung me from school
and took me to the track.

40
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,286
I wanted to do the same
type of thing for Manny,

41
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,373
plus I figured when
Gloria heard about it, maybe
it pays off in the bedroom.

42
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,835
I wonder if that's
why my old man did it.

43
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,754
Oh, crap.

44
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:12,382
[Dad] Your mother-in-law
just had to have the dog.

45
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,509
Turns out she's allergic.

46
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:18,471
And the pet store
didn't have a grace period
or a return policy or anything?

47
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,432
I got him from the pound.

48
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:25,020
Was there a twister in Kansas?
'Cause there's a house
in my driveway.

49
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:28,648
Welcome home, Mr. Dunphy.
Uh, always a pleasure,
Mr. Dunphy.

50
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:32,402
Indeed it is, Mr. Dunphy.
Place it there.

51
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,613

He's always happy.

We're like two peas in a pod.

Or Siamese twins.
Or a snake with two heads.

those things for Halloween.
Yeah.

Oy. This must be Scout, huh?

58
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,676
I should warn you. He sheds.
I made the mistake of letting
him sleep with me on the road.

59
00:02:56,761 --> 00:03:00,096
Now my sheets look like
two bigfoots did it.

How's Mom?
Speaking of big feet, eh?

She's on a cruise
with her girlfriends,

62

some of which are not
totally unattractive.

63
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:11,066
Oh, that reminds me.
She sent some gifts for the kids.

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,068
Um, I will be right back.

65

Bye!
Will do!

I cannot believe you got a dog
without consulting me.

68
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,577
This was a major family decision.

It was wrong.
Yeah.

And I'm sorry.
Mmm.

71
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,540
But we have talked about
getting a dog for years,

72
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,292
and you're the only one
who wasn't into it.

73
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,669
Because I knew that I would be
the one taking care of it.

That's not true.

that one of us stayed home

he was crying.

he makes when he gets
out of a chair?

separate vacations, so-

my dad would tell me about it.
