00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,480
My name is leslie knope,and I work for
the parks and recreation department.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,940
Can I ask you a few questions?

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,040
Would you say that you are
enjoying yourself and having fun,

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,200
having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat
enjoying yourself,or having no fun and no enjoyment?

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,510
I'm gonna put "a lot of fun.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:32,180
" Ms. Knope! There's a
drunk stuck in the slide.

8
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,900
Sir,this--this is
a children's slide.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,790
You're not allowed to sleep in here.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,990
You know,when I first tell people that I work
in the government,they say,"oh,the government.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,020
The government stinks.The
lines are too long at the dmv.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,920
" But now things have changed.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,650
People need our help.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,090
And it feels good to be needed.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,210
- Could you put your arms to your side?
- ****

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,980
- And that might help you slide down a little easier?
- ***

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,950
Do you want to come this way?

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,330
- Okay,we're gonna need you to get out.
- Can you please go away?

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,590
Get out of the slide.

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,700
- Okay?You're...Here we go!
- Can you please go away?

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,110
Okay,wake up.Here we
go.Out of the slide.

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,660
You know,government isn't
just a boys' club anymore.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,150
Women are everyw re.

24
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,710
It's a great time to
be a woman in politics.

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,800
Hillary clinton.Sarah
palin.Me.Nancy pelosi.

26
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,430
We did it!

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,560
You know,I-- I like to tell people,you know,"get on
board and buckle up,"bause my ride'sgonna be a big one.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,520
If "andyou get motion sickness,"you
know,put your head between your knees

29
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,260
'cause leslie knope's
stopping for no one.

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,980
Tonight is our next monthly
community outreach public forum.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,810
And that is tonight.

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,310
- That is tonight.
- Right.

36
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,050
Leslie will be running it.

37
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,590
And we need one more.

38
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,670
Who wants in?

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,360
Tom.

40
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,370
Fine.

41
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,260
This is a great thing
for you guys to see.

42
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:28,010
This is where the rubber of government
meets the road of actual human beings.

43
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,710
When I go through these
doors,I need to be on.

44
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,670
Like the white house press secretary.

45
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,680
Are you ready?

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,110
- Yeah.
-Okay.

47
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,680
Here we go.

48
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,750
It's locked.

49
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,450
Okay.

50
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,240
Here we go.

51
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,740
Thank you so much for
coming.What an amazing turnout.

52
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,810
My name is leslie knope.

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,000
I am the deputy director of the
parks and recreation department,

54
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,590
and tonight we're gonna be
taking some of your questions as--

55
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,620
hello?

56
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,890
We're having a meeting in here.

57
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,500
Does anybody have any
questions about permits?

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,760
So take two.

59
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,640
I'm leslie knope,and with me is
department member tom haverford.

60
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,050
We are here to answer any
and all of your questions.

61
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,560
So fire away.

62
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,140
Well,it's a great day,because,uh,last
month they put me in jail.

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,380
That's right.

64
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,590
The,uh,the head of the police
is a ninth-degree mason.

65
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,830
But the music is so loud.

66
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,570
Stop the graffiti,please.Please.

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,100
I don't like obscenities ju-- just
as much as you don't like them.

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,710
No,it drives me crazy.I have kids.

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,860


71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,150
hey,My  And the guy's,"you  My,You Head.

72
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,450
"  These people are members of a
community that care about where they live,

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,630
so what I hear when I'm being yelled
at is people caring loudly at me.

74
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,700
Now,I have a few t ngs I want
to say about laura linney.

75
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,830
Thank you so much,barry.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,340
Always great to have you here.

77
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,430
Anyone else who would
like to contribute--

78
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,760
I'm ann perkins.

79
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,650
Uh,I'm a nurse,and frankly,I
don't really care for politics.

80
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,310
uh,but,um,I'm-- I'm here to talk about
the abandoned lot on sullivan street.

81
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,100
Excellent.That sounds like a
good idea.Tell us about that.

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,590
No,it's a problem.

83
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,320
It almost killed my boyfriend.

84
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,590
Yeah.

85
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:37,600
There's a lot nearby my house,and a
developer dug out a basement for some condos,

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,250
and then they went bankrupt.

87
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,190
So there's just this giant pit,and
it's been there for almost a year.

88
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,890
12 months,yes.Go on.

89
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,650
Yeah,and,um,my boyfriend,who
is a musician-- actually,

90
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,570
I support him-- but anyway,he
fell in and broke both his legs.

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,940
Ann,let me speak with you for a minute.

92
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,890
So your boyfriend fell
down into this pit,right?

93
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,180
Yes.

94
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:04,140
And,um,this guy-- is it pretty
serious?Are you guys living together?

95
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,510
Yes.

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,970
Uh,I'm sure this must
be really tough for you.

97
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,980
You know,just-- this guy-- sounds like he
didn't have a lot going on for him to start with,

98
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,110
and now both legs broken.He's just weak.

99
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,430
You have to take care of him.

100
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,360
- You probably feel like
you need to move on.- Why--

101
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,630
what does this--  Just become more adventurous
in relationships with your body,just in--

102
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,980
Are you--are you actually
hitting on me right now?

103
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,050
Oh,oh,god,no.

104
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm not-- I'm not hitting
on you.I'm actually married.

105
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,010
I'm just an open person,and
I like connecting with people.

106
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,170
I'm,you know,very comfortable
around women,attractive women.

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,250
I've spent a lot of time with
them.And I just-- I--I don't know.

108
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,470
I feel like we might be taking
up too much of the forum's time.

109
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,950
Maybe we can just exchange numbers.

110
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,530
You know,maybe go away one weekend
and just kind of talk about this.

111
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,490
Look.

112
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,170
I'd love to do it.

113
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,440
The bottom line is I've been trying to get this
thing fixed for months and nobody's done anything,

114
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,760
and it's ugly,and it's dangerous,and it's
government-owned,and you need to do something about it.

115
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,010
Okay.

116
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,020
- I'll do something about it.
- Really?

117
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,120
Yes,we-- I
will help you.

118
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,250
Is that a promise?

119
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,090
It's more than a promise.

120
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,250
It's a pinky promise.

121
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:24,920
I pinky promise all of you that I will
help,and I will go to that location tomorrow

122
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:33,400
and we will fill in that pit,and then when
that's done,we're gonna put a park on the land.

123
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,570
Okay.

124
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Well,I've worked at the parks department for six
years,and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.

125
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:51,510
Recently I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the
sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,940
But this pit-- the chance to build
a whole new park from scratch--

127
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,160
this could be my hoover dam.

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,960
No,that sounds great.

129
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,270
Um,problem is,anything
over $25 I have to report.

130
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:16,450
So,um,maybe give my wife a
call and give her the suits,

131
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,770
and then if they don't fit
her,maybe she'll give 'em to me.

132
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,900
Morning.

133
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,720
All right,mr. Mayor.

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,820
That sounds good.

135
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,670
I'll see you on saturday for
the,uh,ultimate frisbee game.

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
Bye.

137
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,990
Leslie,hello.

138
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,580
You were talking to the mayor?

139
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,610
Yep,we was rappin' about some things.

140
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,770
Tom and I work really well together.

141
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,280
We're both outsiders.

142
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,180
I'm a woman,he's A...
oh,I think he's a libyan.

143
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,590
I am from bennettsville,south carolina.

144
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,100
I am what you might call a "redneck.

145
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,360
"  Okay,brainstorm.

146
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,900
How do we make this park happen?

147
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,260
Let's go to the city council directly
and ask them to put up the money.

148
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,470
No,parks are not a priority.

149
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,340
I need more firepower.

150
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,970
I need bigger guns.

151
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,690
You know what I need to
do?Form a committee.Right?

152
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,600
Yeah,that could work.

153
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,390
Yeah,'cause committees are power,and
committees make things happen.

154
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,300
Committees are the lifeblood
of our democratic system.

155
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,810
That's really good.Write that down.

156
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,960
Yep.

157
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:17,170
From time to time,when I think of an eloquent
saying or a phrase,I have tom write it down.

158
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,940
He's collecting them for my memoirs.

159
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,430
Here's leslie's quote from wednesday.

160
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,660
Okay,read it back to me.

161
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,090
"committees cover our
democracy with blood.

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,360
" Sounded better when I said it.

163
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,410
It's still good,though.

164
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,140
Okay,I have an idea.

165
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,440
What about bringing mark on board?

166
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,430
- Which mark?
- Which mark?

167
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,730
Mark brendanawicz.Which mark?

168
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,290
Well,if you want something done in this
town,you call mark brendanawicz because,

169
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,240
you know,he's a city planner,but he's
more than that.He's kind of like a fixer.

170
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,780
He fixes things.He's
a smart,capable guy.

171
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,780
He just--he knows where
the bodies are buried.

172
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,300
What's up,brendanawicz?

173
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,130
You crazy old polish person.

174
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,590
City hall is like a locker room,and you gotta
get in there and you gotta snap towels at people

175
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,770
and you gotta give 'em the
business,and if you can't take it,

176
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,110
you know,you--you--
then you can't take it.

177
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,900
You--you gotta leave...
the locker room.

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,760
Let's get down to brass tacks.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,370
I know you don't have a lot of time and
I want to thank you for meeting me today.

180
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,730
I just work right there.

181
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,420
Well,thank you for
clearing your schedule.

182
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,670
Oh,I didn't clear anything.

183
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,540
You know this lot that
I'm talking about,right?

184
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,690
Uh,yeah,lot 48.

185
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,400
Um,condo developer.

186
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,710
He dug a basement and
then he went bankrupt.

187
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,270
I checked it out like a month ago.

188
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,860
It's pretty gross.

189
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,370
What would you say if I told you that I
was thinking about turning it into a park?

190
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,060
A park,huh?

191
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,550
Okay.

192
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,540
Well,when I think about the logistics,the various
hoops that you're gonna have to jump through

193
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,430
,I would say--
is it likely?

194
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,140
No,it's not likely,you know.

195
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,820
But is it possible?

196
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,170
No.It's not possible.

197
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,390
I would give up on that one.

198
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,550
What?Why?

199
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,810
Why?Uh,I don't know.There's,like,a
million reasons why.

200
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:16,440
Uh,homeowners' associations,anti-government
nuts,bureaucrats,miles of red tape--

201
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,540
Really?It sounds like you're
telling me to go for it.

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,980
There's no way it can happen.

203
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
I can do this.

204
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,600
I just need a little help.

205
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,620
Could you do me a favor?

206
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,490
For old times' sake?

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,570
Mark and I--
it's complicated.

208
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,660
When you work closely with someone
and you share similar interests

209
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,700
and you have a similar worldview and you're
passionate about the same things,things can happen.

210
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,960
We slept together.

211
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,260
Leslie?

212
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,200
No.

213
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,880
Oh,my god.

214
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,950
You know what?

215
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,940
Yeah,we did,like five years ago.

216
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,450
I'd
sort of--

217
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,210
No,but yeah.Yeah.We did.

218
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,780
Honey,can you straighten
up your area a little bit?

219
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,680
'Cause they're gonna be here soon.

220
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,350
Can--
thanks.

221
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,690
That parks lady is coming over and
we're gonna go take a look at the pit.

222
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,160
I--I think it's probably
just a photo op for her.

223
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,740
I mean,I don't think anybody in
government actually cares about--

224
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,800
Honey,do you mind doing
that somewhere else?

225
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,710
I'm trying to watch tv.

226
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,890
I'm talking about the pit you fell in.

227
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,650
It's ms.Perkins' house.

228
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,070
Doorbell!

229
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,800
Yeah,I heard it.

230
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,860
Doorbell!

231
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,980
I heard it.I'm getting it.

232
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm here.

233
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,710
Look at that.

234
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,730
Safety.

235
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,330
You remember tom from last night.

236
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,780
- Hey,ann,how are you?
- Yeah,hey.Of course I do.

237
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,480
And this is our college intern,april.

238
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,000
She's going to be documenting
our fact-finding mission.

239
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,350
Hey,april.

240
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,180
Is this fun for you?

241
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,850
Yeah,it's so much fun.

242
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,400
Uh,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.

243
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,430
This must be our hero.

244
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,580
The man heard 'round the world.

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
How you doin',son?

246
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,370
Pretty good.

247
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,770
I'm leslie knope.

248
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,490
And the entire government of pawnee would like to let
you know that we will do everything we can to help you.

249
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,470
Could you pass me my itch stick?

250
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,410
Of course.

251
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,210
So,um,andy jumped over this fence.

252
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,300
He was crossing through to get
home and then he fell right there.

253
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,160
Oh,my god.

254
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,170
How did we let this happen?

255
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,990
Dream with me for a second,ann.

256
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,560
Doesn't this neighborhood
deserve a first-class park?

257
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,000
Imagine a shiny new playground with a
jungle gym and swings,pool,tennis courts,

258
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,680
volleyball courts,racquetball courts,basketball
court,regulation football field.

259
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,820
We could put an amphitheatre over
there with shakespeare in the park.

260
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,590
It's really not that big of a pit.

261
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,470
We could do some of those things.

262
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,000
It's gonna take a little extra work.

263
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,250
But why not try?

264
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:31,200
I think that would be great.

265
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,810
Me,too.

266
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,760
I'm going in.

267
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,780
- Why?
- 'T w donorry.I have a hard hat on.

268
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,510
- I can see
that,but--  Yeah.

269
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,060
- April,document this.
- Okay,why?

270
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,560
The key to any fact-finding mission is to
get right into the battle zone,you know?

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,520
It's like george bush when he flew over new orleans or richard
nixon when he went to china to see what the chinese were up to.

272
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,830
No.

273
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,760
Leslie,are you okay?

274
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,670
Leslie!

275
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,160
Hold o april's gonna get
some photos for the website.

276
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,420
Can you just be still?

277
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,490
Don't move around as much.

278
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,490
Okay,squeeze my fingers.

279
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,410
Good.

280
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,640
Does it hurt a lot?

281
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,980
No.

282
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,590
I'm fine.

283
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,890
No,you're not.

284
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,140
Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.

285
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,360
But it--
it fell off.

286
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,580
After my head hit that rod.

287
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,970
I can't believe you fell
in,too.That's awesome.

288
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,610
It's not awesome,andy.

289
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,750
Well,at least my boss will listen
to me now that I broke my clavicle.

290
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,160
It's not broken.

291
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,340
It is.

292
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,150
Do you have one of those
neck foam collar brace things?

293
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,930
Honestly,you're--
you're fine.

294
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,840
Oh,honestly,my clavicle's broken.

295
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,040
Oh,hey,baby,if you're going to the
kitchen,could you make me pancakes real quick?

296
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,590
Uh,sure.

297
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,120
Ooh,are pancakes being made?

298
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,740
Yeah,sure.

299
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,690
I don't know,she's a little doofy.

300
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,380
But she's sweet.

301
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,960
Ron,please.

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,380
No.No way.

303
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,760
Come on,ron.

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,140
I've been a loyal foot soldier.

305
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,630
Give me my shot.

306
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,980
Let me have lot 48.

307
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,710
Is that a travel
pillow around your neck?

308
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,000
Ron,I don't know how
to explain this to you.

309
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,700
When you've been down in the
pit-- have you been in the pit?

310
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,250
No,I haven't gotten down there yet.

311
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
- Well,I have.
-When you fell in.

312
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,910
When I visited the bottom of the
pit on a fact-finding mission.

313
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:39,250
And when you're down there,you get some
perspective about what it all means.

314
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,470
And let me tell you something,ron.

315
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,320
What it means is... I
want this subcommittee.

316
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,340
I've been quite open about
this around the office.

317
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,140
I don't want this parks department to build
any parks because I don't believe in government.

318
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,550
I think that all government
is a waste of taxpayer money.

319
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,520
My dream is to have the park system privatized
and run entirely for profit by corporations.

323
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,610
Well,I will definitely think about it.

324
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,460
I like the sound of that "definitely.

325
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,600
" I'm gonna leave before
you change your mind.

326
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,520
Mr. Swanson,I presume.

327
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,260
Lot 48.Thoughts?

328
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,570
Yes?No?Me?

329
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,950
Park?Giving the park to me?

330
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,140
Still mulling.

331
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,550
She's insatiable.

332
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,010
She's like A... little
dog with a-- a chew toy.

333
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,950
All right,you guys.All
right,all right.I'll ask him.

334
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,820
Everybody wants to know
what your decision is.

335
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,730
Someone on the phone about the park.

336
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,610
You know,I don't think I even want it.

337
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,270
Oh,man.

338
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,700
The clavicle's still really hurting me.

339
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,980
this is a great shot.

340
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,200
I know.

341
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:08,870
That's awesome.

342
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,270
I think she's crying in
that one.Look at this one.

343
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Hey,kids.

344
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,750
That's another good one.

345
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,940
Hey,brendanawicz.

346
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,470
You gotta come check this out.

347
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,910
Leslie took us out to that pit
in lot 48 and she fell inside.

348
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,460
And we have some awesome photos.

349
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,320
- Uh,is she okay?
- Yeah,she's fine.

350
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,380
Oh,this is a classic.

351
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,090
That's the best one.

352
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,180
The up-skirt photo.

353
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,840
Awesome.

354
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,140
Hey,man.

355
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,990
Give me the photo back.

356
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,480
What's going on?

357
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,890
Don't worry.I can print more.

358
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,240
Leslie is unique.

359
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,630
Um,government work can beat you down.

360
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,710
I would say that I lost my optimism
about government in about two months.

361
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,490
Leslie's kept hers for six years.

362
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,990
I've got a few rules about how to
survive and prosper in a government job,

363
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,750
and I think I'm about to
break one of those rules.

364
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,450
I want you to give lot 48 to leslie
so she can try to build a park.

365
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,430
Why should I?

366
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,470
You owe me one,remember?

367
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,100
Do you want to cash in for this?

368
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,470
Yeah,I do.

369
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,730
So this was built in 1935.

370
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,900
It's called pioneer hall.

371
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,850
A little trivia-- it is one of the first
structures in america to ever have locks.

372
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,010
Oh,yeah.

373
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,620
This is our crown jewel.

374
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,120
It's one of our best murals.

375
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,280
It depicts the very famous
battle at conega creek.

376
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,340
We have a lot of children visit,so often we have
to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.

377
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,260
That is horrifying.

378
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,290
Yes,it is.

379
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,300
So what do you want to
see?The dmv?Animal control?

380
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,720
- Or we
could--  Leslie.

381
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,280
We did it.

382
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,110
Ron's approved our committee.

383
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,990
- Oh,m D.
-That's great!

384
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,620
- That's so great.
-That's so exciting!

385
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,760
This is huge.

386
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm barely 34,and I've already landed a
parks department exploratory subcommittee.

387
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,390
I'm a rocket ship.

388
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,880
Leslie.

389
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,070
I just heard the news.

390
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,370
- Isn't it great?
- Congratulations.

391
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,980
Thank you.I'm so excited.

392
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,250
It's exciting,isn't it?

393
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,840
- It is.
- Yeah.

394
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,290
Should I call a press conference now,or?

395
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,760
- Yeah,call one.Definitely.
- I would.

396
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,180
Every now and then we have these little
gatherings and leslie gets plastered.

397
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,820
One time I convinced her to try
to fax someone a fruit roll-up.

398
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,530
She one time made out with the
water delivery guy in her office.

399
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,510
On halloween,she was
dressed up as batman.

400
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,590
Not batgirl.Batman.

401
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,410
And I convinced her to go stop a
crime that was going on outside.

402
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,970
And it is my favorite
thing in the world.

403
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,030
You know what?America is awesome.

404
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,260
It's so full of hope and small
towns and big cities and real people

405
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,450
and delicious beverages and hot guys.

406
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,930
You just never know when
opportunity is gonna strike.

407
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,170
- Yeah.
-You gotta be ready for it.

408
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,310
- Yeah.
- Are you excited?

409
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,220
- Definitely am.Fired up.
- Yeah!

410
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm really fired up.

411
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,900
I--you know they say that democracy or
whatever only works when people get involved?

412
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,490
Well,I'm getting involved.

413
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,640
So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do
whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.

414
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,440
Even if it takes two months.

415
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,010
Soul sista,soul sista

416
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,010
- gonna get your phone,sista
- Yeah.

417
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,830

I've created this office as a symbol
of how I feel about government.

421
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,850
This sawed-off shotgun
belonged to a local bootlegger.

422
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:49,600
People who come in here to ask me for
things have to stare right down the barrel.

423
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,260
Did you guys get a grant to do this?

424
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,050
This is my basketball court.

425
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,780
I don't want to see any double dribble.

426
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,360
I don't want to see any
three-second violations.
