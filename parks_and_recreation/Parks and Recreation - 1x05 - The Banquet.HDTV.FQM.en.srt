00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,468
Today we are welcoming a delegation

2
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:05,171
from the parks department
of our sister city,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,305
Boraqua, Venezuela.

4
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:10,593
Our photo-op with the mayor
is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.,

5
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:14,263
so I'm going to need your suggestions
about my wardrobe asap.

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,104
I told you...
Gold-sequined sweatpants.

7
00:00:17,229 --> 00:00:18,934
Also, remember, everyone,

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,520
Venezuela is a poor country.

9
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:23,397
These men are not used

10
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:26,984
to the wealth and flash that we
have here in central Indiana.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,617
Our only job over the next two days
is to make these men feel at home.

12
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:33,592
Yes, I am a little nervous.

13
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:37,119
Pawnee has kind of a tricky history

14
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,404
with welcoming foreign visitors.

15
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,757
But things have changed.

16
00:00:42,882 --> 00:00:45,882
Our guests are going to stay
in a motel for sure.

23
00:01:08,202 --> 00:01:10,091
Oh, God, what if they
don't speak english?

24
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:12,029
April, you know spanish, right?

25
00:01:12,154 --> 00:01:13,963


26
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,575


27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,293
Oh, good.
Excellent.

28
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:20,601
My mom's Puerto Rican.

29
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,176
That's why I'm so lively
and colorful.

30
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,711
Oh, my God. Here they are.
Okay, everybody, clean up.

31
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:29,799
Pull your thing up.
Everyone just be good.

32
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,621
Jerry, hit it.

33
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,343
This is my baby.

34
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,301
I put this whole trip together.

35
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,764
And let me tell you something...
It has not been easy.

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,309
You know, how do you fit all
of Pawnee in a 48-hour visit?

37
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:47,286
I had to drop the rock-and-roll
bowling alley from our itinerary.

38
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,278
One of the most difficult
phone calls I've ever had to make.

39
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,447
Hello, most excellent
representatives

40
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,199
of the great parks department
of Boraqua, Venezuela.

41
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,820
I am deputy director
of Parks and Recreation

42
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:01,948
and chairwoman
of the departmental ad hoc

43
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:04,165
subcommittee for Pit Beautification,
Leslie Knope.

44
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,306
It's a pleasure. I am
<i>vice director ejecutivo del diputado</i>

45
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:09,955
<i>del departamento de parques,</i>

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,757
Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro
de Veloso de Maldonado.

47
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,521
I'm Tom.

48
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:17,419
These are my colleagues,
Antonio Rivera-Fonseca,

49
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:19,296
minister of small fountains,

50
00:02:19,775 --> 00:02:22,767
and Elvis correja,
administrator of hedges.

51
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:24,340
And he is?

52
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,831
Pay no attention to him.

53
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,063
He's our intern, Johnny.
He is worthless.

54
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,524
We are quite tired from our trip.

55
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,985
Could you have your servant
collect our bags, please?

56
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,575
- What did he call me?
- It's a different culture, okay?

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,355
Just be a good host
and do this for me.

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,416
Fine.

59
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:42,203
Yes, we'll get our pathetic servant boy
to fetch your luggage. Go, boy.

60
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:45,925
Now, I know you gentlemen
had a long flight,

61
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,043
but I have prepared
a welcome party in your honor.

62
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:51,091
Excellent, I like to party.

63
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,714
Well, my job is to see
to your every need.

64
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,051
Do we just...
select the woman we desire?

65
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,834
I will take the large black one.

66
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,681
- Interesting choice.
- What?

67
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,742
Do you have some kind of a book
with photos of the women available?

68
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,879
If not, I will also take
the sexy black one.

69
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,572
I am not surprised at all.

70
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:14,967
I've been to South America.
I did very well there.

71
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,575
There might have been
a translation problem.

72
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,404
When I said party, I meant one
that did not include sex for pay,

73
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,080
but one that had
food and drink and dancing.

74
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,655
That sort of thing.

75
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:26,871
So no women?

76
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,710
Off to kind of a weird start.

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,713
We have so much
to learn from each other.

78
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:37,299
- What kind of birds do you eat?
- Chickens.

79
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:40,177
Us too.
Amazing.

80
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,473
What is this?

81
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:43,598
Water.

82
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,558
I'm sorry... <i>Agua</i>.

83
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,811
In our country government officials
drink only bottled water.

84
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,896
That water's very safe to drink.

85
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,143
No. Bottled.

86
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,916
Please.
Send the boy.

87
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,694
Tom, go get water.

88
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,363
- Leslie, come on.
- For your troubles.

89
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:03,136
You got it, chief.

90
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:08,372


91
00:04:09,117 --> 00:04:11,319


92
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,682


93
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:19,128
- Can you help me out a second?
- Go away, jerry.

94
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:24,537


95
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,900
This is a gold-plated replica
of a gun Hugo Chavez used

96
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,787
in the 1992 socialist revolution.

97
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,233
It is a gift.

98
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,566
This gun truly symbolizes
the blossoming peace

99
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:42,377
between our two nations.

100
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,243
A key aspect to diplomacy
is gift-giving.

101
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,904
The gift has to be nice enough
to honor and respect the guest,

102
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,329
but not so nice that it shames him.

103
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,891
Plus, it needs to represent
the local culture.

104
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,545
And I found the perfect thing.

105
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:59,651
A bottle of high-fructose corn syrup

106
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:03,228
made right here
in Pawnee's own sweetums factory.

107
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:06,554
"If you can't beat 'em, sweetums."
Since 1891.

108
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:10,262
And eight and a half dozen
rubber baby-bottle nipples.

109
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,424
Also made here in Pawnee.

110
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,188
Kernston's rubber nipples.

111
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,172
"Tastes like the real thing."

112
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:25,824
Yes, and we too are pleased to be here
in your dirty alleyway.

113
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:29,022
We thank you
for the container of sap

114
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,788
and the bag of garbage.

115
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,379
His english isn't perfect,
so I don't think he realizes

116
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:35,042
how insulting he's being.

117
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:38,515
We are also sister cities
with Kaesong, North Korea.

118
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:40,717
Their town is far nicer.

119
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,801
That's fine. It's my job.
I'm a diplomat.

120
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,636
I'm not supposed
to take it personally.

121
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,680
We haven't been here for a long time,
but what we have seen is

122
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:51,502
really, from the bottom of our hearts,
truly depressing.

123
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,219
Really, really sad stuff.

124
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,845
I mean, that's why people
respect Hillary Clinton so much,

125
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,982
'cause nobody takes
a punch like her.

126
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,944
She's the strongest, smartest
punching bag in the world.

127
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,977
It's funny because
Antonio said to me,

128
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:07,088
"can we turn this car around
"and say we're sick or something,

129
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:08,545
or that we lost our way?"

130
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,769
Of course that would be rude to you.

131
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,916
- What is your profession?
- I'm a city planner.

132
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:18,527
This city was planned?

133
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:21,361
On the drive in,
I saw a tattoo parlor

134
00:06:21,486 --> 00:06:23,424
next to a school
next to a Taco Bell.

135
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,719
It looks like it was designed
by a very stupid rodent.

136
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,680
He's actually a pretty smart rodent.

137
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:33,197
You have a quick wit.

138
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,645
I've changed my mind.
I will have you for the evening.

139
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:38,939
Oh, boy.

140
00:06:39,547 --> 00:06:41,358
She'll get back to you on that.

141
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,826
Politically, no.

142
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,453
I don't support Chavez.

143
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,228
I despise him
and everything that he does.

144
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,368
On the other hand, this is
a pretty sweet-ass gun.

145
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,249
- The banana you wanted, <i>señor</i>.
- Finally.

146
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,465
You peel.

147
00:06:59,090 --> 00:06:59,940
What?

148
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:01,911
With your hands,

149
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:03,655
you peel the banana.

150
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,636
Let's get started, shall we?
I have a full day of activities planned.

151
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,773
I would like to see where the children
are fed the sweeteners.

152
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:13,919
Our restaurant?

153
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:16,104
American children
are fattened more efficiently

154
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,278
than any other children
in the world.

155
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:21,413
They're like little basketballs.
I mean, they're huge.

156
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,565
Little porkers.

157
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,494
This is our thermometer.

158
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,281
I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit
into a community park,

159
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,442
but I need $35,000,

160
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,533
and the city doesn't have
enough money in its budget.

161
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:37,581
- I do not understand.
- You've never had a budget shortage?

162
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:47,071
Venezuela is blessed
with massive oil reserves.

163
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:50,053
Massive, I mean, tremendous,
like you would not believe.

164
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,054
The state sells the oil,

165
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,995
keeps all the money,

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,933
and we build whatever we want.

167
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:00,646
Now I do not understand.

168
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:06,527
I feel that my English
was very clear.

169
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:09,154
Shall I repeat?
Venezuela...

170
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,885
Venezuela, my country...

171
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,072
has a lot of oil.
Oil is food for cars.

172
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,077
The Venezuelans
are very confident people.

173
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:22,501
I know these guys didn't turn out to be
exactly how we thought they would be.

174
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,982
You said they might not know
what toilet paper is.

175
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:26,380
I'm calling an audible.

176
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,090
We can't be humble anymore.

177
00:08:28,378 --> 00:08:30,633
We're going to take them
to our best park,

178
00:08:30,758 --> 00:08:32,488
and we're gonna blow
their socks off.

179
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,887
I don't think
that's gonna blow their socks off.

180
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:38,014
We'll go further, to Chicago
and pretend it's part of Pawnee.

181
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:39,685
Or New York.
Or London!

182
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,614
The money's different.
They'll figure it out. Never mind.

183
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:43,939
We'll go to the park.

184
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:47,100
Everybody doing okay back there?
Comfortable?

185
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:53,006
Well, the motel we're putting you up in
is really nice.

186
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:54,449
You can watch TBS.

187
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:56,702
Do you have TBS in Venezuela?

188
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,536
I have everything in Venezuela.

189
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,543
I have four satellite dishes
on my estate.

190
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,076
We get 14,000 channels.

191
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:07,396
14,000.

192
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:10,743
I already know
who wins project runway.

193
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,218
I'm coming over to your house, then.

194
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,868
I see what you're getting at.

195
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:17,598
I am still primarily interested
in the large black woman.

196
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,147
Here we are.
Take it in, boys.

197
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:27,858
- This is an embarrassment to America.
- I'm sorry?

198
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,731
- You are right to want to correct this.
- Correct what?

199
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,005
This is the giant pit of dirt
you were telling us about, is it not?

200
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,325
The one you want
to turn into a park?

201
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,262
This is already a park.
And it's one of our best-loved parks.

202
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,237
Why are the trees so small?

203
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:47,002
They're not that small.
Besides, size doesn't matter.

204
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,144
Yes, it does.

205
00:09:49,408 --> 00:09:50,756
Our trees are huge.

206
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,758
We build tunnels through them.

207
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,108


208
00:09:56,566 --> 00:09:58,388


209
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,864


210
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:04,519


211
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,612


212
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,484
The parks in Boraqua
are far superior.

213
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:13,111
The park in my hometown,
the parque del este,

214
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,490
we have a monorail,
and we have an aquarium.

215
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:19,371
And the Jaripa amphitheatre is huge.

216
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:21,328
Lady Gaga played there last week.

217
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:23,653
Great, we don't have Lady Gaga.

218
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:27,873
And I don't think she's gonna come here
unless her career takes a very bad turn.

219
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:30,908
But we have something
more beautiful than Lady Gaga.

220
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,033
Democracy.

221
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:35,884
I'm going to show you an example.
Let's go to a town-hall meeting.

222
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:37,728
Elvis.

223
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:38,887
Henry!

224
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:41,682
Raul... butterfinger.

225
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,692
Antonio, Nestle crunch
with the crispy rice removed.

226
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:48,086
Weird choice, but for you

227
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,912
I got it done.

228
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:56,363
I find it incredibly demeaning,

229
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,556
but, guess what?

230
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,136
<i>Cash money</i>

231
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,445
<i>I'm going to make it rain</i>

232
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:04,955
I'm gonna pick that up real quick.

233
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,582
So are you guys ready?
We're about to start.

234
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,418
This is
where you have your meetings?

235
00:11:10,005 --> 00:11:11,553
Well, the location rotates.

236
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:14,172
Sometimes we have them
on the volleyball courts.

237
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:17,676
Where do you hold yours?

238
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,514
Well, now that you asked,
we usually rotate as well

239
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,598
between different fortresses
and citadels and palaces.

240
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,476
We don't need palaces.

241
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,057
The ideas are what shine
in our meetings.

242
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,240
What are you, some kind of moron?

243
00:11:32,365 --> 00:11:35,714
Why don't you have hand dryers
in the park bathrooms?

244
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,364
They're so much more sanitary
than paper towels! Anyone knows that!

245
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,519
My dog went to one of your parks

246
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:43,243
and ate another dog's feces,

247
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,454
and I am going to sue you for that.

248
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:47,099
How do you like it?

249
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,253
How do you like that?

250
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,668
Now imagine you're holding coffee!

251
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:53,337
This is outrageous.

252
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,214
Where are the armed men
who come in to take the protestors away?

253
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:57,174
Where?

254
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,148
This kind of behavior
is never tolerated in Boraqua.

255
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,066
You shout like that,
they put you in jail.

256
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,234
Right away.

257
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,051
No trial, no nothing.

258
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,852
Journalists...
We have a special jail for journalists.

259
00:12:08,977 --> 00:12:10,817
You are stealing...
Right to jail.

260
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:13,380
You're playing music too loud...
Right to jail. Right away.

261
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,122
You're driving too fast?
Jail.

262
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,168
Slow? Jail.

263
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,046
You're charging
too high prices for sweaters,

264
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,442
glasses, you right to jail.

265
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,880
You undercook fish...
Believe it or not, jail.

266
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,595
You overcook chicken...
Also jail.

267
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,009
Undercook, overcook.

268
00:12:28,134 --> 00:12:30,499
You make an appointment with a dentist
and you don't show up...

269
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,888
Jail, right away.

270
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:34,139
We have the best patients
in the world...

271
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,564
Because of jail.

272
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,442
Well, it was tough going,
but it was lively.

273
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:43,996
- What did you think of the open forum?
- This meeting of ugly people yelling...

274
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:45,180
It is like torture.

275
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:46,797
That's one perspective.

276
00:12:46,922 --> 00:12:50,282
In Boraqua, the government moves
like a hot knife through butter.

277
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:52,446
I'm supposed to sit here
and listen to people,

278
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,546
these fat faces turning all red.

279
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:56,233
You kidding me?
We're like kings.

280
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,569
We walk down the street,
and they treat us like rock stars.

281
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,780
We answer to nobody.

282
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,771
In a true democracy, we believe

283
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,242
that the input of our citizens
is extremely valuable.

284
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:10,810
These pretzels suck.

285
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,291
Thank you.
See?

286
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:16,231
No wonder nothing ever
gets done here.

287
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:17,546
Nothing gets done?

288
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,619
Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge
or American Idol

289
00:13:20,744 --> 00:13:23,574
or the moon. Oh, wait.
You can't 'cause you've never been.

290
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,345
Look, this is not personal.

291
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:29,896
We just think that you are weak,
and your city is disgusting.

292
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,406
I think you're rude.
And you've been rude since you came.

293
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,814
And I think that
your medals are stupid.

294
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,964
And your uniform is lame.

295
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,319
And you guys want to marry
Hugo Chavez.

296
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,823
Do not disrespect Chavez.

297
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,700
Stupid Chavez.

298
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,715
- I told you not to disrespect him.
- I did.

299
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,455
- That's twice.
- I don't like Chavez.

300
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,874
- You do, and do not disrespect him.
- No, I don't.

301
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,001
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't, Raul.

302
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,779
Look, if you don't
like it here, then go.

303
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,673
- Great.
- Good, shut up.

304
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,341
We're shutting up, yeah.

305
00:14:03,638 --> 00:14:04,783
Here we go.

306
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:08,753
- Those are our pens.
- Great. We don't even need them.

307
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:11,857
- Great. Then don't take them.
- We didn't.

308
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:17,346
They started it.

309
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,910
Those guys were rude, arrogant,

310
00:14:21,035 --> 00:14:23,028
narrow-minded, class-a jerks.

311
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,736
Now, I may have lost my cool,
but they deserved it.

312
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:28,533
Okay, I'll call the mayor
and cancel the photo-op.

313
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,702
No, don't.

314
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,454
Then call the Venezuelans
and apologize.

315
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,957
No, they were rude, arrogant,
narrow-minded, class-a jerks.

316
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:39,002
Okay, then I'll call the mayor
and cancel the photo-op.

317
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:44,633
- Do you see the problem here?
- Yes, but I don't want to.

318
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,050
Yesterday I was tough and direct.
And today I have to be charming.

319
00:14:49,274 --> 00:14:52,682
Basically, yesterday
I was Hillary Clinton, today I'm Bill.

320
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,850
Gracias.

321
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,416
Can I get anyone anything to drink
before we start...

322
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,646
- Coffee, brandy?
- I'd love some coffee.

323
00:14:59,065 --> 00:14:59,987
Anything?

324
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:01,942
- Some nuts?
- I'll have Some nuts.

325
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,368
- Gummi bears.
- Sure.

326
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:04,624
Apple crisps.

327
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,279
- Granola bars.
- I'll take those.

328
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:08,156
Nothing?
Sure?

329
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,659
OK, I'll be right there
if you need me.

330
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:14,224
Well, Raul, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

331
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,417
I would just like to first say
I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday.

332
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,460
It was completely uncalled for.

333
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,030
We are sorry as well.

334
00:15:23,311 --> 00:15:25,297
We were very tired
from our long journey.

335
00:15:25,422 --> 00:15:26,883
Also, we were a bit jealous.

336
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:30,876
Our colleagues from Caracas are
visiting their sister city of Miami.

337
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,754
They've been partying
with Dwayne Wade.

338
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,682
They sent us all these photos
and Quicktime files,

339
00:15:36,807 --> 00:15:39,229
I mean, you have to see
this place Miami, just gorgeous.

340
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,287
There's so much soul and life.

341
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:42,997
Every little, tiny street.

342
00:15:43,122 --> 00:15:45,360
So much culture and history,
and the cars...

343
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:47,130
People take care
of their cars there.

344
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:50,695
I noticed that in the pictures.
They're a little older but beautiful.

345
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,617
It's really nice, and the food...

346
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:54,744
So spicy and wonderful.

347
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,632
We could not even believe.

348
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,157
But Pawnee is really good as well.

349
00:16:00,748 --> 00:16:03,574
In any case,
I made a few phone calls,

350
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,389
and the government of Venezuela

351
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:08,083
has authorized

352
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:09,865
a special gift

353
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,779
for you.

354
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:19,311
$35,000?

355
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,080
Yes, it is to fill your pit,

356
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:23,023
to start to build a park.

357
00:16:24,412 --> 00:16:25,944
We can't take this.

358
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,367
Yes, yes, please.

359
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,030
We'll see you later today
at the photo opportunity.

360
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,576
And I think we are good here.

361
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,153
Good meeting.

362
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,919
Maybe I should return the money.

363
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,774
It's from a foreign government.
I don't really trust them.

364
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,946
- I'm gonna return the money.
- Are you crazy?

365
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:53,480
- You could buy a low-end Lexus.
- Or you could build a park.

366
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:55,166
Let's look at the pros and cons.

367
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:59,331
- Pro, we could fill in the pit.
- Con, maybe it's dirty money.

368
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,645
Pro, $35,000 worth of dirty money.

369
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,065
- Con, not quite sure why that's a pro.
- Pro, we can fill in the pit.

370
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,084
Con, Ann already said that.

371
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,202
Pro and con never works.

372
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,820
Pro, yes, it does.

373
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:13,561
I don't...

374
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:19,071
Fine, we'll keep the money, OK?
Everybody happy?

375
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:20,898
- Jerry, are you happy?
- What did I do?

376
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,457
Meeting adjourned.

377
00:17:57,184 --> 00:18:00,036
Can I just say, I still feel
kind of weird about this money.

378
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,324
I know they've given you
a hard time.

379
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,354
When the mayor gets here,
we'll do the photo-op,

380
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:07,377
they'll be out of our hair.
You'll get to build your park.

381
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:13,618
The mayor will be with us
in a few minutes.

382
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:17,176
We would like to take a video of you
to show our superiors.

383
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,189
Sure.

384
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:19,914
Do you have the check?

385
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,129
Yes, I do.

386
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,171
OK, you can show it to the camera,

387
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:27,300
and say how much it is
and what it is for.

388
00:18:28,678 --> 00:18:31,495
Okay, this is a check for $35,000,

389
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,195
- and it is to build a park.
- How generous.

390
00:18:35,254 --> 00:18:36,892
Yes, it's really generous.

391
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:39,141
Now say, "viva Venezuela".

392
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,063
Viva Venezuela.

393
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,345
Viva Chavez.

394
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,615
Thank you, Venezuela.

395
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,103
- Viva Chavez... Say it.
- Ah, come on.

396
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,510
I don't want to viva that guy.

397
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,576
We just gave you $35,000.

398
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:56,301
That's worth one viva.

399
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,024
Viva Chavez.

400
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,183
Yes, viva Chavez.

401
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,367
What is he saying?

402
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,063
They are very happy.

403
00:19:19,796 --> 00:19:22,913
They say Hugo Chavez
will love this video,

404
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,233
because it is another success
for their committee.

405
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,415
Committee?

406
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,310
They're a committee
to humiliate and shame America.

407
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:34,839
Gonna be a good video.

408
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:38,438
The committee to humiliate
and shame America?

409
00:19:39,002 --> 00:19:41,602
Yes, it is Hugo Chavez's
passion project.

410
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,644
We just had an idea.

411
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:45,711
Why don't you call your park
after Chavez?

412
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,852
You call it, "Hugo Chavez park".

413
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:51,208
You can have
a nice big fountain of his head

414
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,359
so that when the water is coming out,
he's spitting at you all the time.

415
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:57,889
You should write this down.

416
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:02,595
Viva America.

417
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,785
Viva Pawnee.

418
00:20:04,234 --> 00:20:06,854
Viva mayor Walter Gunderson.

419
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:08,734
You have offended us.

420
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,375
You have offended
the government of Boraqua.

421
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:13,479
You are no longer our sister.

422
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,676
No, America is not perfect.

423
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:22,713
But diplomacy isn't just

424
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,734
sucking up and being a pushover.

425
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:26,950
Sometimes you got to get tough.

426
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:30,133
I am going to build
that park myself,

427
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,355
and it is going to be awesome.

428
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:36,533
And it's not going to have a fountain
shaped like Hugo Chavez's head

429
00:20:36,658 --> 00:20:38,681
spitting water all over everyone,

430
00:20:39,223 --> 00:20:41,025
unless that's what the people want.

431
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:44,109
And that, sir, is democracy.

432
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,137
Leslie, come see this.

433
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,458
Check out this video
that April sent me.

434
00:20:51,714 --> 00:20:54,916
<i>Hey, guys, I'm at Jhonny's place
in Venezuela.</i>

435
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:56,386
<i>It's okay, I guess.</i>

436
00:20:56,511 --> 00:20:58,511
<i>He has, like, 5 million rooms.</i>

437
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,323
- <i>And this is only his guest house.</i>
- Holy cow.

438
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,527
<i>There's a lot of guys
with guns here.</i>

439
00:21:03,968 --> 00:21:06,025
<i>It's better than
my mom's house, I guess.</i>

440
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,559
<i>So tell Leslie I don't know
when I'm going to be back.</i>

441
00:21:09,849 --> 00:21:11,410
<i>And Donna's here.</i>

442
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:14,897
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
