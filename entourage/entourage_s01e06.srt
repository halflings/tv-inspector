1
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:15,562
Do I look overdressed, Vince?

2
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,298
You gotta dress like
they're pulling you out of your day.

3
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:20,397
Get all suited up,
you look fucking desperate.

4
00:01:20,508 --> 00:01:22,908
- Is your name Vince, asshole?
- You look good, Johnny.

5
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,807
Besides, why would you listen to a guy...

6
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:26,937
who's only worn sweats
since the eighth grade?

7
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,413
I know things.

8
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,518
- Ari.
- Welcome.

9
00:01:30,518 --> 00:01:31,075
- Ari.
- Welcome.

10
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,410
Koppelman bar mitzvah is in Ballroom 3,
by the way.

11
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,292
- I knew it, I look desperate.
- I'm kidding, you look amazing.

12
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:40,257
You're fucking old school.
Where's he going?

13
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,989
He's going downstairs
to Adam Davies' office, third floor.

14
00:01:44,198 --> 00:01:47,565
Thanks a lot, Ari, I appreciate it, man.
Turtle, roll with me.

15
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:48,997
- Come on.
- All right.

16
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:50,070
Good luck, bro.

17
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:51,798
- Thanks, man.
- Break a leg.

18
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,534
You have a good weekend?
You ready for this?

19
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:55,876
What?

20
00:01:58,412 --> 00:01:59,709
What are we doing here, Ari?

21
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:03,045
I'm pulling out the big guns.
Showing you the power of this agency.

22
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,176
- It's just a meeting, right?
- No, it's not just a meeting.

23
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:09,620
- It's not, then what is it?
- It's a fucking experience.

24
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,851
Gentlemen, welcome to mecca.

25
00:02:20,868 --> 00:02:23,996
Big opening, baby. $18.6 million!

26
00:02:25,072 --> 00:02:28,735
This is what happens
when your movie opens huge. $18.6 million.

27
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:52,198
Excuse me, honey, do you know
where I could find Adam Davies?

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,632
- Yeah, two down on the left.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,496
You got any bagels or anything at all?

30
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,742
I want to start by saying
you could not be in a better position...

31
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:05,641
and we are so fucking proud of you.

32
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:08,146
We got a lot of stuff to get to.
Start us off, Trish.

33
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:11,446
<i>Koresh, a gritty feature version
about the FBI's take down...</i>

34
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:13,179
of the Branch Davidian leader.

35
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:15,949
The studio's interested in Vince
for either David Koresh...

36
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:18,457
or the young, out-of-control FBI agent.

37
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:21,153
- Director status?
- They are out to Milos Forman.

38
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,423
<i>Milos Forman's a genius,
you see Cuckoo's Nest?</i>

39
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,658
- No, I did the play in high school.
- All right.

40
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,893
- And he was great, I saw it.
- I sucked.

41
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,765
All right, check this out.

42
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,895
Is there anymore of that tuna tartare?

43
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:34,099
Absolutely. Keep it going, what do we got?

44
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:35,903
<i>The Last Wasteland.</i>

45
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,605
James Gray scripted a smart tale
about the American worker...

46
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,507
but set against a post-apocalyptic
underwater society in 2050.

47
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,547
They're talking to Charlize Theron
for the female lead.

48
00:03:47,355 --> 00:03:50,153
<i>- She's great, we loved Monster.
- She's hot.</i>

49
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:51,383
Put a check next to that.

50
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,653
Charlize has a statue,
let's get Vinny a statue.

51
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,089
So what, are they redoing your office?

52
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:59,063
I haven't been assigned an office yet.

53
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:04,993
Adam Davies' office.
He's in a meeting, can he return?

54
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:15,746
When I read the e-mail
that Vincent Chase's brother...

55
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,047
needed an agent, I assumed
it must be his younger brother.

56
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:23,283
Biologically, I'm older,
but I think we play around the same age.

57
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:29,595
What have you been doing lately, John?
You working at all?

58
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:35,092
I've been working steady for
the last twelve years, minus the last three.

59
00:04:36,437 --> 00:04:39,406
I'll fight for you. But I can't lie.

60
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:42,801
It's not gonna be easy
to get you back in the game.

61
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,371
Back in the game?

62
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,488
I am the fucking game, pal.

63
00:04:55,122 --> 00:04:57,147
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

64
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,550
Back in the game.

65
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,824
Some pretty good ideas, though.

66
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:07,760
<i>What the American Taliban:
The John Walker Lindh Story?</i>

67
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,001
Did it happen?

68
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:12,665
It was one idea, but it happened.

69
00:05:12,773 --> 00:05:15,435
Listen, I'm tired of this.
I've asked you 10 times now.

70
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,807
<i>Why isn't the deal for
Queens Boulevard done yet?</i>

71
00:05:17,912 --> 00:05:20,847
Because there is no offer.
Why is there no offer?

72
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,542
There's no money.
No money means it's not a real movie.

73
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,142
Which means they're just
a bunch of words on a page.

74
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,483
- Yeah, but they're good words.
- Great words.

75
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,389
These scripts that you're talking about,
they could be good, and they could suck.

76
00:05:32,493 --> 00:05:35,656
- They could suck, Ari.
- This we know is good 'cause this we lived.

77
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:37,390
You know what? E's right.

78
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:39,466
<i>We should just focus on Queens Boulevard.</i>

79
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,001
You know what they feed people
on an indie set, Vinny?

80
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:45,265
Nothing. No trailer.
They tell you to go sit on an apple box.

81
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:47,602
You ever try to bang an extra
on an apple box?

82
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,939
- Lf anybody could do it, Vince could.
- I do have great balance.

83
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:53,806
Look, okay. We threw out, what, 10 ideas?

84
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:57,475
Ari, stop, you're not listening to me.

85
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,814
<i>Look at me.
We want to do Queens Boulevard.</i>

86
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:04,788
Sit down, do what you got to do,
call who you got to call...

87
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,884
stop the agenting bullshit,
and get us a fucking offer.

88
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,454
Damn.

89
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,261
My boy's blossoming.

90
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:20,004
- Good work, E. Way to keep him on his toes.
- What did he do?

91
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:23,338
He had Ari freaking.
I thought he was going to cry.

92
00:06:23,444 --> 00:06:27,005
I had to straighten him out a bit.
I'm tired of his bullshit all the time.

93
00:06:27,114 --> 00:06:29,639
- You the man!
- Johnny, how did your meeting go?

94
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,819
Wake up, Drama.
They're asking how your meeting went.

95
00:06:33,988 --> 00:06:37,480
This guy, with no office...

96
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:40,387
no assistant,
answering his own fucking phone...

97
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:42,862
is willing to hip pocket me.

98
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:45,455
Can you believe that shit?

99
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:49,063
You want to fire Ari, Vince.

100
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:52,395
Fredo is angry.

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,172
I'm serious, Vince,
the guy does nothing for you.

102
00:06:55,276 --> 00:06:57,005
All right, what are you so upset about?

103
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,045
You asked him to help me
with representation.

104
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:00,977
The best he can do is Adam Davies?

105
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:04,676
- You serious, Drama?
- You know what, Johnny's right, E.

106
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,221
I asked Ari to help him and he sets him up
with a glorified assistant.

107
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:11,189
- I'm actually semi-upset.
- Thanks, Vince.

108
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,823
At least you're dressed up
for tonight, Drama.

109
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:17,125
- We still have to go to this thing?
- It's for Shauna, we have to go.

110
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:19,791
This fucking art, man. Fuck art.

111
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,629
What are we? Come on.

112
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:24,003
It's a very nice of you to show up.

113
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:34,144
- What is this crap?
- He's Shauna's client, so be nice.

114
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,748
Why, is he retarded?

115
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,512
This piece evokes all of the emotions...

116
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:44,016
from what I call a discombobulated man.

117
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:47,086
This is emotional dyslexia.

118
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:50,090
This is emotional confusion.

119
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,727
And what is emotional confusion, you ask?

120
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:57,497
It's like running naked
through a cornfield backwards at midnight.

121
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:04,411
That was beautiful, Gary.

122
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:12,846
You know...

123
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:16,479
this kind of reminds me
of Jason Pollock's early work.

124
00:08:16,624 --> 00:08:19,718
He employs a similar technique.
Pointillism, they call it.

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,458
<i>- How do you know?
- I read for Basquiat.</i>

126
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:25,862
Nice try, Drama, but first of all
his name is Jackson Pollock...

127
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:28,093
and his work was called
abstract expressionism.

128
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,399
Pointillism's a style using points of color,
this is neither.

129
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:34,474
- Yeah, you're full of shit.
- I took art history in college.

130
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:37,442
- Yeah, community college, loser.
- At least I went to college.

131
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:38,841
- I was working.
- Schmucks.

132
00:08:38,946 --> 00:08:40,072
What?

133
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,005
Do you like the work or not?

134
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,413
- Phenomenal.
- Fabulous.

135
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,484
Sweet stuff.

136
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,627
- Gus.
- Johnny Drama.

137
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,524
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

138
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:59,429
- Good, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

139
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:02,060
- Glad to have the job.
- Get out of town.

140
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:03,936
Gus, I can't believe this.

141
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:06,563
<i>You were the second lead
in Cornelius and Son.</i>

142
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:09,268
- I was only a recurring.
- That was nine years ago.

143
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,703
Your brother's doing great.

144
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,072
Yeah, everyone gets their moment.

145
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:19,449
This catering company is really cool.

146
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:23,114
Most of the waiters are actors.
They're really flexible when it comes to...

147
00:09:23,223 --> 00:09:26,715
going on an audition, or getting a job,
a commercial or something.

148
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:28,419
That's cool, man.

149
00:09:28,696 --> 00:09:31,290
So, you know, if you want
to make a few extra bucks.

150
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:38,833
- Yeah. Thanks, Gus.
- Shrimp puff?

151
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,639
- What the fuck did you say?
- Shrimp puff.

152
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,845
No, I'm good.

153
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,839
- Shauna.
- Josh.

154
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:51,042
I want the most expensive piece
your boy's got.

155
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,711
You're a doll. Gary is going to be thrilled.

156
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,584
You know Josh, we share some clients.

157
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,850
- What's up, E?
- How you doing, Josh?

158
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,389
<i>- He gave us Queens Boulevard.
- I rep the writer.</i>

159
00:10:01,962 --> 00:10:03,589
Yeah, he's a hack.

160
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,023
- I'm kidding, I loved it.
- Come on!

161
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:11,362
- Emily, how you doing?
- I'm pretty good, how are you?

162
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:12,971
Great, you kidding me?

163
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,041
You guys know each other?

164
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:18,441
Yeah, we both started
in the mailroom together.

165
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:19,705
Remember that, Josh?

166
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,478
Guys, I'm having a little bash
at my place in Malibu this Saturday.

167
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,849
It's gonna be off the hook,
you guys should come.

168
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,251
Yeah, any girls gonna be there?

169
00:10:28,355 --> 00:10:31,552
The only girls in this town
who won't be there are the ugly ones.

170
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,159
You're so gross.

171
00:10:33,727 --> 00:10:34,716
We'll be there.

172
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:37,820
Great. E., see you then. Vince.

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,792
Eric, Ari would freak
if he knew you were going...

174
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,427
to a party at Josh Weinstein's.

175
00:10:44,538 --> 00:10:46,836
- Why? It's a party.
- No, you have to tell him.

176
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:49,135
- Lf you don't tell him, I have to.
- So tell him.

177
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:52,235
You're going, too, we have plans
on Saturday night, remember?

178
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,308
- Man, that was chilling.
- What?

179
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:00,549
- I just got offered a job.
- Nice, buddy, what's it for?

180
00:11:00,654 --> 00:11:01,916
Yeah, as a fucking waiter.

181
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:04,320
I don't know, Drama,
that's a lot of responsibility.

182
00:11:04,424 --> 00:11:07,552
- Maybe you should try out busboy first.
- Eat shit, Turtle.

183
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,925
Why don't you serve it to me, motherfucker.

184
00:11:16,103 --> 00:11:17,229
My bad.

185
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:25,043
- Where am I going?
- Ivy, you're 20 minutes late.

186
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,807
- Ari, I need to talk to you about something.
- Walk with me.

187
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:30,475
Vince and the guys will be partying
at Josh Weinstein's.

188
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,814
- Who's Josh Weinstein?
- He's your old assistant.

189
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,046
I have many old assistants.

190
00:11:34,154 --> 00:11:36,213
Two before me, after Jackie, before Jared.

191
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:38,621
My "J" phase,
I think I fired him for stealing pens.

192
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:41,853
- Why do I care about Josh?
- Now he's an agent at Triad.

193
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:45,393
<i>And he's the one who gave
the boys Queens Boulevard.</i>

194
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:49,002
That's why no more guys.
You fire a guy and you create a rival.

195
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:51,036
You fire a woman
and you create a housewife.

196
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:52,628
That's sweet, you're still late.

197
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,401
Hold all my calls,
get mini-Vince on the phone.

198
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:01,637
- Hello?
- Hey.

199
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,807
Saturday, grab the boys,
I got the floor seats.

200
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:06,511
<i>- Really?
- Yeah, $2,400 a pop.</i>

201
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,485
You're gonna be sitting on Jack's lap.

202
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,581
Guys, Ari's got floor seats
for the Lakers on Saturday.

203
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,250
<i>- Who they playing?
- Who they playing?</i>

204
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,225
Playing the Wizards, it'll be a great game.

205
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:17,661
- Wizards.
- Fuck that, bro.

206
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:21,692
<i>- No go, Ari. Thanks, anyway.
- They're playing the Cavs Sunday night.</i>

207
00:12:21,802 --> 00:12:24,100
- That's King James.
- Get us tickets for that.

208
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:25,899
Vince wants floor seats for Sunday.

209
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,867
Let me ask you something.
Should I be worried about this little party...

210
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,345
you guys are going to
over at Josh Weinstein's house?

211
00:12:34,448 --> 00:12:37,747
You should be worried about floor seats
for the Lakers on Sunday.

212
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,658
I want you to go to that party on Saturday.

213
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,491
Represent the agency.
Let Vince know that my army's everywhere.

214
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,690
Ari, I don't want to get in the middle of this.

215
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,097
You are in the middle of this, like it or not.

216
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:58,296
You want to be a hero?
You want a medal or are you a coward?

217
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:01,067
Stop the hippie shit, strap on a helmet,
start shooting.

218
00:13:01,174 --> 00:13:04,268
This is Malibu. I want you to storm
that beach like it's Normandy.

219
00:13:20,394 --> 00:13:22,021
This is great, right?

220
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,722
If you were at Ari's house right now,
you'd be changing diapers.

221
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:40,977
I can't believe Busey's here.

222
00:13:41,548 --> 00:13:44,608
$12,000 you got to pay him, Turtle?
When you gonna get it to him?

223
00:13:44,718 --> 00:13:46,549
Busey's a lunatic, you better pay him.

224
00:13:46,653 --> 00:13:50,487
<i>He beat up the gaffer on Point Break
just for cutting in on the lunch line.</i>

225
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,648
I heard that.

226
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:54,192
Some shit goes down,
you guys got my back, no?

227
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,023
Sorry. No, I don't mess with Busey.

228
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,426
Pussies.

229
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,500
Don't worry, Turtle, I got your back.
I'll put Busey on his ass.

230
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,931
No doubt, Drama.

231
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:05,732
Can I be straight with you?
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Ari.

232
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,969
He's been like a grandfather to me.
But he's trying to kill this deal.

233
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,773
Yeah, how's that?
He said he never got an offer.

234
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:17,048
They made an offer. I spoke to Scott Wick.

235
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:20,785
You gotta step in
or this movie's gonna go away.

236
00:14:25,158 --> 00:14:26,750
I took a couple of bad hits.

237
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:29,587
Made a movie in Spain that tanked,
then I got divorced.

238
00:14:29,696 --> 00:14:30,993
Cunt took half my money...

239
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,157
and the rights to my only
viable book property.

240
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:36,064
I started drinking.
Finally pulled myself out of the gutter.

241
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:38,069
Needed something more stable,
got into this.

242
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,943
So you like what you're doing?

243
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,675
You like being a waiter?

244
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,340
Yeah, asshole, I love serving crab cakes
wearing a fucking monkey suit.

245
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,349
Drama, I'm freaking, man.
I keep thinking Busey's behind me.

246
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,187
Relax, he's an old man.
He'll probably split soon.

247
00:15:02,596 --> 00:15:06,623
You're on his calls all day.
I mean, is it true? Did we get an offer?

248
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:09,497
Eric, don't put me in this position, okay?

249
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:12,003
- What position?
- He's my boss.

250
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:15,734
What if he's your boss? Who cares?
Is he more important than whatever we are?

251
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:17,173
Don't ask me that.

252
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,246
Fine. I'll ask Ari, then.

253
00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:25,150
Eric, if you call Ari, I'm leaving. Right now.

254
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,350
I can't.

255
00:15:35,896 --> 00:15:38,490
- Honey, our kid is bored out of his mind.
- You know what?

256
00:15:38,598 --> 00:15:42,193
- He's having no fun at his birthday party.
- What are you doing? Filming him.

257
00:15:42,302 --> 00:15:44,361
How about if he does a trick,
how about that?

258
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:47,531
Light himself on fire,
the kids will notice him, know what I mean?

259
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:50,269
- Lf I kicked him in the head...
- Excuse me, Mr. Gold.

260
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:51,971
Jeff Kahn.

261
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,047
- How's it going?
- Good.

262
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:57,649
I'd like you to have my head shot.

263
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:00,219
Thanks. It's my kid's birthday,
if you don't mind.

264
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,015
Yeah, no, that's great.

265
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:05,758
I totally understand, it's cool.
Why don't you take my reel?

266
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:10,523
- It's got a lot of good stuff.
- Thank you.

267
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,791
- I'm doing a showcase, actually.
- Hello?

268
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:15,265
<i>Why are you trying to shut down
Queens Boulevard?</i>

269
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:18,303
- What are you talking about?
- I know Scott Wick made an offer.

270
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:20,533
Scott Wick tell you that?

271
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,235
No, I spoke to our new agent.
Josh Weinstein, motherfucker.

272
00:16:28,348 --> 00:16:31,112
- I'm doing a showcase...
- Where do you think you're going?

273
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:33,709
They just flew in a liver,
I gotta do the transplant.

274
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,345
- Where do you think I'm going?
- You are such an asshole.

275
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:38,583
I'm the asshole
that pays for your art lessons...

276
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:40,853
gets celebrities
to attend your charity events...

277
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:43,691
- and supports your deadbeat brother.
- Little agent boy...

278
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,898
you better be back here for the cake.

279
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:49,159
Okay.

280
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:54,799
Gary?

281
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:56,609
Gary.

282
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,380
Gary.

283
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,318
- Turtle?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:05,986 --> 00:17:08,648
Listen, I just wanted to come over
and apologize to you...

285
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:13,419
for breaking your sculpture the other night.
It was an accident, and I'm sorry.

286
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:15,090
I just leaned up against it.

287
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:17,390
- It was kind of an accident...
- Listen.

288
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:19,099
I could snap your sternum with one blow
from my forehead to your chest...

289
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,798
I could snap your sternum with one blow
from my forehead to your chest...

290
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:27,566
I could raise my head up
and loosen your teeth.

291
00:17:27,674 --> 00:17:29,539
Knock you down, grab you by the lip...

292
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:32,612
pull you up, and tell you I'll be right back.

293
00:17:34,414 --> 00:17:37,542
While we're here, we're all looking
for the art within ourselves.

294
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:40,176
Gravity, inertia, and physics...

295
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,445
it's like a round robin.

296
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:45,989
I'm cleansing you.

297
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:51,524
In the name of art,
and everything art stands for.

298
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:55,226
Remember this, art is only the search,
it's not the final form.

299
00:17:57,003 --> 00:18:00,598
You know you're burning these?
You're burning the nutrition out of them.

300
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:03,540
- I'll have one of those.
- Don't eat that, Vince, it's garbage.

301
00:18:03,643 --> 00:18:04,837
I like them burned.

302
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,277
- Aren't you Johnny Chase?
- Yeah.

303
00:18:07,514 --> 00:18:09,539
<i>We're huge fans of Viking Quest.</i>

304
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:11,276
- Really?
- Yeah.

305
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:14,276
<i>You girls are too young
to have seen Viking Quest.</i>

306
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:17,049
We watch it all the time
on the sci-fi channel.

307
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:20,221
- What was your favorite episode?
- My favorite episode...

308
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,488
remember when you were
frozen for 30 years?

309
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,757
And then you woke up
and your wife was remarried.

310
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:26,855
- That was great.
- That was awesome.

311
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,328
<i>The Thawing.
Your favorite episode is The Thawing?</i>

312
00:18:30,437 --> 00:18:31,529
Yeah.

313
00:18:32,172 --> 00:18:33,332
Take a hike, honey.

314
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,703
- What?
- You heard me, I said beat it.

315
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:40,707
Let's go.

316
00:18:43,683 --> 00:18:45,310
What the hell are you doing?

317
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:47,352
<i>The Thawing was Turtle's favorite episode.</i>

318
00:18:47,454 --> 00:18:50,184
- It was a setup.
- Come on, we were only joking, man.

319
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:52,121
What's wrong with you?

320
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:57,285
It's over, bro.
I'm gonna be working the grill at Chili's.

321
00:18:57,797 --> 00:19:00,925
Come on. It's gonna work out.

322
00:19:03,536 --> 00:19:07,404
Thanks, bro.
I'm gonna go take a walk down the beach.

323
00:19:19,286 --> 00:19:22,517
- Keep it right out here, I won't be long.
- You got it, sir.

324
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,232
Where's Weinstein?

325
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:39,672
- Anyone seen Josh Weinstein?
- He's outside drinking mimosas.

326
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:43,106
There you go,
the motherfucking host of this shindig.

327
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:49,309
After that he does the movie
and gets the Oscar.

328
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:52,212
That's how it went. Hey, Ari.

329
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,016
- That's a great story.
- How you doing? Crashing parties now?

330
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,816
You know Joshie, here?

331
00:19:57,924 --> 00:20:00,757
I don't know if you guys know,
but he used to be my assistant.

332
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,920
- That was a long time ago.
- Fourteen months, that ain't that long.

333
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,157
He used to make the best hazelnut latte.

334
00:20:06,266 --> 00:20:09,167
He was like a chemist in there working,
just like Mommy made.

335
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,102
- It was fantastic.
- Ease up, man, it's a freaking party here.

336
00:20:12,205 --> 00:20:14,400
Does your boss know
that you're using his house?

337
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:18,136
'Cause I put a call into him.
He and I went to school together.

338
00:20:18,244 --> 00:20:20,735
I helped him cheat on his economics final.

339
00:20:20,847 --> 00:20:23,645
That's how he got his degree,
he owes me big time.

340
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:25,714
- You called my boss?
- Absolutely.

341
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:28,754
You know what other class
I took at Harvard? Business ethics.

342
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:32,416
I don't steal other people's
motherfucking clients.

343
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:36,655
But in your case,
I'm going to make an exception.

344
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:38,526
I'm going to take everyone.

345
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:42,294
Your B-level sitcom stars,
your Reality TV writers.

346
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:45,331
When I'm done with you,
you'll be repping sideshow freaks.

347
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,531
You need Jojo the dog-faced bitch boy?

348
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,269
Call Josh Weinfuck,
the lightweight, pen-stealing fuckface.

349
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,649
That's awful.

350
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:02,653
Now, where's my boy, Vinny Chase?

351
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:10,028
Look what the tide dragged in.

352
00:21:10,463 --> 00:21:12,294
Fucking beach houses, man.

353
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:15,294
Pieces of shit. If they were in town,
they'd be condemned.

354
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:16,494
Nice view, though.

355
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:20,570
I hate the beach, I hate the ocean,
I hate the sand. I love sharks.

356
00:21:20,673 --> 00:21:22,903
I just signed the girl
that got her arm ripped off.

357
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:24,943
Gonna be the one-armed Marlee Matlin.

358
00:21:25,044 --> 00:21:27,103
So what are you doing here?

359
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:35,384
<i>Okay, I think it's the height of stupidity
to follow head-on with Queens Boulevard.</i>

360
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:38,616
- That's the God's honest truth.
- That's all we ever asked for, Ari.

361
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,159
I don't want to show you my hand.
I'm working for you.

362
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,196
<i>This thing turns out to be
the next My Big Fat Greek Bitch...</i>

363
00:21:44,297 --> 00:21:47,391
makes $500 million,
why shouldn't you get rich?

364
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:48,759
I like rich.

365
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:51,393
<i>Ask the people that didn't
get back in on the Passion.</i>

366
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:53,301
Jesus ain't gonna save them.

367
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:57,934
<i>Are you telling me, man-to-man, you're
not trying to fuck up Queens Boulevard?</i>

368
00:21:58,044 --> 00:22:00,069
I'm not going to answer that again.

369
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,207
We appreciate your honesty, okay?

370
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,184
- Don't get used to it.
- Don't worry, I won't.

371
00:22:06,286 --> 00:22:08,754
You do this, the next one's a studio picture.

372
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:10,982
- We'll discuss it, I'll think about it.
- No.

373
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:12,955
Franchise, baby, all right?

374
00:22:13,126 --> 00:22:16,459
With a lunch box, we're gonna get you
the whole action figure...

375
00:22:16,563 --> 00:22:18,690
with a huge cock for me.

376
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:21,028
- All right?
- It's very tempting.

377
00:22:21,134 --> 00:22:23,432
- I love you.
- Right back at you.

378
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:31,306
Drama, call Adam Davies back.

379
00:22:32,312 --> 00:22:34,177
Come on, the guy's barely an agent.

380
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,340
Barely an agent got you
three auditions next week, jackhole.

381
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,439
Call him.

382
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,647
Thanks, Ari.

383
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:45,420
Three auditions.
Guess I don't have to be a waiter.

384
00:22:49,128 --> 00:22:51,119
Gary Busey.

385
00:22:51,865 --> 00:22:54,333
How are you, man?
Good to see you, baby, it's Ari.

386
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:56,392
- Ari.
- Yeah.

387
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:58,801
<i>You worked craft service
on Lethal Weapon I?</i>

388
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:01,635
I did not.
I used to represent you, remember?

389
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:03,072
I know you.

390
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,078
You are a gut maggot, with no guts.

391
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,840
You're gonna spin off this planet.
I love it, keep at it.

392
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,439
- Okay, Ari.
- God bless you.

393
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,952
God bless you.

394
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,392
What direction is that?

395
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,895
That's east, you idiot.

396
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:26,690
It's west, idiot.

397
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,594
I mean in New York, it's east.

398
00:23:30,703 --> 00:23:33,866
- West, Turtle.
- Either way, it's fucking beautiful.
