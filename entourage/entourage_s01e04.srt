{6467}{6489}"Vincent.
{6492}{6544}"I believe we were together in a past life.
{6546}{6607}"I believe we were destined|to be together in this one."
{6609}{6652}You should call her, Vince. It's destiny.
{6654}{6722}- Besides, she's got a great ass.|- That's a great idea, Turtle.
{6725}{6759}Have her catch a ride out here...
{6761}{6833}with the Kevorkian guy from Michigan|who wants Vince to kill him.
{6835}{6945}He's right. We don't need another psycho.|Look, better keep this, just in case.
{6979}{7036}Tanya, this is my brother, Vince.
{7039}{7116}- Good luck tonight.|- Yeah. Me and him, both.

{7624}{7704}- True.|- Come on, baby. I'll walk you out.
{7984}{8008}Give me a call.
{8225}{8249}What?
{8251}{8321}Where'd you meet her, Drama?|Barry Bonds hearing?
{8328}{8378}Please. Tanya's all natural.
{8394}{8429}I met her at the Vitamin Expo.
{8432}{8500}- She's booming, huh, Vince?|- She's got a pretty face.
{8511}{8549}She gave me the ride of my life.
{8552}{8623}I just hung onto those lats|and surrendered all control.
{8638}{8756}You know, if I was holding onto those lats,|I'd think I was fucking Evander Holyfield.
{8810}{8834}Fuck you guys.
{8837}{8921}I ain't cooking shit for any of you.|Let's see what you do about that.
{9013}{9097}We should hit Encino first.|It's playing at the Galleria at 6:15.
{9100}{9159}Check out the Valley girls.|Then we head over the hill.
{9162}{9185}Good call.
{9188}{9253}I don't want to see the movie.|I can't watch myself again.
{9256}{9287}I love watching myself.
{9289}{9336}Too bad the audience doesn't.
{9358}{9402}Vince, you gotta see it with live crowd.
{9405}{9468}Especially the midnight show|at the Westwood Mann.
{9471}{9504}It's all hot UCLA ass.
{9507}{9571}- I don't know. What do you think, E?|- I don't know.
{9574}{9624}I didn't know|we were thinking about doing this.
{9627}{9695}- What's to think about?|- I made plans.
{9761}{9816}On the night my movie's opening|you made plans?
{9818}{9878}- Bullshit.|- You said you didn't want to think about it.
{9881}{9926}I didn't want to think about it together.
{9929}{9981}- What kind of plans did you make?|- Nothing.
{9986}{10021}I have a date.
{10102}{10131}You have a date?
{10133}{10194}Yeah. Emily asked me to go to dinner.

{10289}{10364}He's fucking a guy.|You're getting asked out like a little bitch.
{10367}{10409}I'd say it's a very big deal.
{10430}{10472}- Touché.|- Thank you.
{10481}{10507}Douche bag.
{10509}{10563}I haven't been on|a real date since high school.
{10565}{10637}That's because nobody dates in L.A., Vince.|It's a waste of time.
{10639}{10718}- And money.|- L.A. Lives between 2:00 a.m. And 5:00 a.m.
{10722}{10792}You take a lap through the talent pool.|Catch and release.
{10794}{10817}Online's even better.
{10820}{10909}You get the small talk out of the way|so when they show up, they're good to go.
{10912}{10963}Name one girl|you ever pulled off the Internet.
{10965}{11027}There are confidentiality agreements|with these sites.
{11029}{11053}I ain't telling you shit.
{11056}{11133}- Why don't we all grab dates tonight?|- No, don't grab anybody.
{11136}{11204}- You can bring Tanya.|- You guys aren't coming with me.
{11206}{11266}It's opening night, it's a work night.|I need you.
{11269}{11312}- Fuck that, man.|- Come on, I'm serious.
{11314}{11371}No, you're not.|I want to get to know this girl.
{11373}{11422}- Will you give me a fucking break?|- So do we.
{11425}{11467}Make sure you don't get another lemon.
{11469}{11532}Just relax. It's not such a big deal.|It'll be fun.
{11535}{11614}- It'll be like prom.|- I guess you won't have a date then.
{11619}{11690}I told you 10,000 fucking times.|She had food poisoning.
{11693}{11719}Yeah, right.

{12166}{12220}When it comes to|an opening weekend for you...
{12223}{12287}do you have those rituals|that everybody else go through...
{12289}{12371}like, you got to pack dirt on your face|or sacrifice a goldfish?
{12373}{12406}No, I'm not superstitious.
{12409}{12434}- At all?|- No.
{12437}{12465}I heard...
{12468}{12552}that Mel Gibson carried a cross up|Temescal Canyon before {y:i}Passion opened.
{12555}{12604}- It must have worked, huh?|- It sure did work.
{12606}{12649}Vince would've been a gorgeous Jesus.
{12652}{12717}What's going on?|What you got planned for tonight?
{12720}{12764}My buddy E. Got asked out on a date.
{12776}{12799}That's nice.

{12930}{12976}- Here we go.|- Relax. It's fine.
{12978}{13052}His ex-girl crushed him.|So he's looking to get laid.
{13079}{13125}Eric, sit down. Don't fuck with his rhythm.
{13127}{13149}This is embarrassing.
{13152}{13199}He's telling the world|about my personal life.
{13202}{13259}Relax. The world could give|a shit about your life.
{13261}{13285}What are you doing?
{13288}{13373}- You got some hot celebrity, some model?|- Right. Some hot chicks.
{13393}{13429}- I don't have a date yet.|- What?
{13431}{13469}Vincent Chase doesn't have a date?
{13472}{13501}I find that hard to believe.
{13504}{13568}We got a lot of females|out there listening right now.
{13570}{13646}Can we bring somebody up in here? Not Liz.
{13649}{13707}We gonna take a phone call for you, Vince.
{13729}{13768}Christy, what do you got tonight?
{13771}{13854}Stop hitting on my assistant, Turtle.|Besides, she'd never go out with you.

{13933}{13970}You can speak.
{14010}{14069}I'd never go out with you, Turtle.
{14073}{14098}Ouch.

{14855}{14952}I'm leaving San Diego right now.|I'll be back in L.A. For the night.
{14958}{15026}I'd love to go out with you.|You look hot on the billboard.

{15661}{15711}It's gonna be a nice time, honey.
{15737}{15776}When did you move away?
{15825}{15889}What about that cute roommate of yours?
{15928}{15960}Married?
{15964}{16010}Yeah. Congratulate her.
{16035}{16105}Yeah. I'll call you if I ever get to Oregon.
{16226}{16274}What do you think, Arnold?
{16307}{16353}Baby, I know you like my hair natural.
{16355}{16416}But I'm gonna|put a little product in it, okay?
{16420}{16501}Don't be so controlling.|All right, I'll talk to you later.
{16984}{17053}{y:i}- Am I 21st century or what?|- Yes, you are, Ari. What's up?
{17067}{17127}{y:i}I had video sex|{y:i}with an Ecuadorian girl this morning.
{17129}{17186}I hope she was 18. Federal offense if not.
{17206}{17264}{y:i}She had big teeth and a sarong.|{y:i}That's all I remember.
{17266}{17293}What's going on?
{17305}{17356}{y:i}Seriously, here's the deal. Don't panic.
{17373}{17412}{y:i}The matinees were less than stellar.
{17414}{17464}- Fuck.|{y:i}- I just said don't panic.
{17466}{17520}- I'm not panicked.|{y:i}- This is a date movie.
{17531}{17583}{y:i}This Pixar squirrel is killing us.
{17585}{17636}{y:i}'Cause all the mommies|{y:i}who want to fuck Vince...
{17638}{17690}{y:i}are taking their kids to see The Squirrel.
{17693}{17720}{y:i}We're gonna be fine, though.
{17722}{17770}{y:i}Where are you guys gonna be?|{y:i}I want to meet.
{17773}{17812}Vince is tired. We're staying in.
{17814}{17858}{y:i}Why are you so dressed up, then?
{17868}{17914}I hate that you can see me. You know that?
{17917}{17985}{y:i}I love that I can see you.|{y:i}It's why I bought the thing for you.
{17988}{18050}{y:i}- Show me a little nipple.|- Bye.
{18177}{18219}- Hello?|- So, who is she?
{18221}{18245}Who's who?
{18247}{18320}My friend told me they heard|you on Power 106 this morning.
{18323}{18346}Yeah?
{18349}{18398}Since when do your friends|listen to rap music?
{18401}{18453}You're taking your first date out|with the guys?
{18456}{18511}I guess you don't want|this one to work out either.
{18513}{18565}What do you care?|You broke up with me, right?
{18568}{18631}In case you'd forgotten, we just had sex.
{18642}{18714}You said it was break-up sex.|What do you want from me?
{18717}{18777}You want me to just|keep chasing you around?
{18780}{18818}Maybe I don't know what I want.
{18821}{18885}Maybe you should figure it out|and then call me.
{18949}{18987}What the fuck is this?
{19081}{19144}- What's with the limo?|- Turtle thought it'd be funny.
{19147}{19218}- I'm taking my own car.|- You're not taking your own car. Move.
{19221}{19268}Yes, I am. This girl will think I'm an idiot.
{19271}{19351}Tell her it was my idea|and let her think that I'm the idiot.
{19353}{19415}You're cock-blocking me so bad|right now and you know it.
{19417}{19473}What are you talking about?|You think I like Emily?
{19476}{19547}No, I think you think I like Emily|and you're trying to shut it down.
{19550}{19576}Why would I do that?
{19578}{19657}You don't like it when I get a girl|and you get stuck with the retards.
{19660}{19688}You know what?
{19690}{19745}I'll get a girl|and leave you with the two retards.
{19748}{19785}See how you like it.
{19796}{19861}Bro, you just broke up with Kristen.
{19874}{19949}Fuck around a little bit.|Have a little fun before you get serious.
{19952}{20023}What are you talking about, serious?|It's a first date.
{20025}{20085}Emily's not the kind of girl|you just play with.
{20102}{20179}Fine, I'm going.|But if you guys fuck around, I'm out.
{20186}{20235}Who's gonna fuck around?
{20243}{20280}Did you talk to Ari?
{20283}{20327}- Yeah.|- What'd he say?
{20376}{20418}- It's all good.|- Yeah?
{20434}{20481}- Yeah. It's cool.|- Good.
{20492}{20531}Smile, biatches.
{20585}{20634}What's with him? Is he still trying to bail?
{20637}{20706}- Did you even get a date yet, Turtle?|- Of course I got a date.
{20709}{20775}We have to pick her up|from the Burbank airport in one hour.
{20777}{20895}- What is she? A Russian mail-order bride?|- No, dick. She's a hottie from Flagstaff.
{20911}{20999}- From Flagstaff? Who?|- An old friend. Don't worry about that.
{21003}{21036}Where're we going tonight?
{21039}{21099}Tanya needs to know|so she can dress accordingly.
{21102}{21152}Dolce. You called, right, Turtle?
{21155}{21180}No. Me and Vince decided...
{21183}{21272}we don't want to watch Demi cutting|Ashton's steak all night into tiny pieces.
{21274}{21348}- Where are we going?|- I got us a couple of lanes at Lucky Strike.
{21351}{21385}- Bowling?|- Nice.
{21409}{21444}I'll get my ball.
{21525}{21560}That's gonna go.
{21605}{21677}Take it easy, baby.|You're making me look bad.
{21898}{21988}- This is totally fucked right now.|- What are you talking about?
{21991}{22055}- Your friends are so cool.|- Yeah?
{22061}{22160}- My ex-girlfriend hated hanging out with us.|- No wonder she's your ex-girlfriend then.
{22165}{22221}Eric, you're not paying|enough attention to me.
{22224}{22288}- You're bad.|- The worst.
{22295}{22365}- Leave him alone.|- Turtle, how'd you guys meet?
{22385}{22410}JDate.
{22425}{22461}Isn't that for Jews?
{22470}{22532}- So?|- She's wearing a cross.
{22558}{22628}She's reformed. Joanne's up.|Give her a hand, everybody.
{22717}{22764}It's not polite to stare, E.
{22782}{22806}Vince.
{22849}{22872}Watch me.
{22911}{22941}How do I know her?
{23041}{23065}Yeah.
{23085}{23142}Jesus Christ. Come here, you sick fuck.
{23220}{23244}You out of your mind?
{23247}{23303}If you didn't have Emily,|you wouldn't have called?
{23305}{23371}This girl is psychotic.|You understand what I'm saying?
{23373}{23451}The girl just wanted to meet Vince.|Let's not unfairly label people.
{23453}{23520}This is a bad night for this shit.|I don't need this tonight.
{23523}{23561}What are you so stressed out about?
{23564}{23614}I'm stressed|because the movie's not doing good.
{23617}{23668}E., the movie's huge. Relax.
{23670}{23719}Joanne says it's destined to be a classic.
{23721}{23762}She says it's destined to be a classic?
{23765}{23818}She's destined to be|in a fucking insane asylum.
{23821}{23867}Keep her under control.
{23917}{23963}God, you eat like a little bird.
{23992}{24015}Stop it.
{24033}{24065}Tweet, tweet.
{24072}{24130}Vince, I saw your movie today.
{24133}{24174}Yeah? What'd you think?
{24181}{24246}- I loved it.|- Really? You see?
{24254}{24334}- Another satisfied customer.|- I heard. Was the theater crowded?
