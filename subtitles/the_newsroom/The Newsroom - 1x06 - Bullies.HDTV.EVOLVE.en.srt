1
00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:01,738
It's another <i>TMI</i> story.

2
00:00:01,761 --> 00:00:03,798
You've had Wade on the show
five times in six weeks.

3
00:00:03,833 --> 00:00:05,498
- What's the story gonna be?
- It's gonna be

4
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:08,032
that you're trying to get
your boyfriend elected to Congress.

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,535
You can't think
I used you to raise his profile.

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,936
I know for sure
you didn't use me.

7
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,105
Plus, nobody in his right mind
would risk losing you.

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,241
- You look really nice tonight.
- Yeah?

9
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:17,808
<i>Definite yes, yeah.</i>

10
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:20,879
I didn't know that I was in love with you,
too, until--

11
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:23,714
- You cheated on me with your ex-boyfriend.
- That's what happened!

12
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:26,582
- It's been three years. Time hasn't helped?
- No.

13
00:00:26,616 --> 00:00:28,615
I want to give you
five minutes every night

14
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,184
to talk about where we are
and how we got here.

15
00:00:31,218 --> 00:00:32,619
There are people more
qualified than I am.

16
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:34,823
Yeah, the thing is,
they're not going to have your legs.

17
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:37,425
I would not ask you if I didn't think
you were qualified.

18
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:40,729
Come after me all you want, Nina,
but you touch my staff

19
00:00:40,764 --> 00:00:44,366
and I will rededicate my life
to ruining yours.

That's <i>News Night</i>.
Thanks for washing us--

28
00:02:48,156 --> 00:02:50,156
Watching us.
Let me get out of here.

29
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,159
Will McAvoy is coming up with
the <i>Capitol Report</i> from Washington.

30
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:55,695
- I'm Terry-- no.
- <i>Wow.</i>

31
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:58,798
- That's not true.
- End the broadcast.

32
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,534
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.

33
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:04,004
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully,
with the <i>Capitol Report</i> from Washington.

34
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:06,373
Good night.

35
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:12,045
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm fine.

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,281
- "Thank you for washing us"?
- Think people noticed?

37
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:17,251
I do.
Stand here on this spot.

38
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:19,453
- What are you doing?
- Administering an eye exam.

39
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:21,889
- Excellent.
- Read the top line.

40
00:03:21,923 --> 00:03:24,158
- E.
- Next line.

41
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,627
I don't know why people think there's
a problem with health care in this country.

42
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,962
- Our current system is fine.
- Next line.

43
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,865
<i>L-G.
The next line, R-T-Z.</i>

44
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,533
The Greek letter for pi,

45
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:35,135
the geometric symbol
for congruent,

46
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:36,903
and something off the table
of natural elements.

47
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:39,172
Great, put your tie back on
and get in the studio

48
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,374
so we can retape that
for the West Coast.

49
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:43,175
What's the problem?

50
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,344
I didn't get
much sleep last night.

51
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:47,112
- How much is not much?
- None.

52
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,482
- Seriously?
- I went to bed at midnight, didn't fall asleep.

53
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:52,217
Is this the first time
that's happened?

54
00:03:52,251 --> 00:03:54,152
- No.
- Is it the second time?

55
00:03:54,186 --> 00:03:56,088
I'm having a little bout
with insomnia.

56
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:57,522
Have you tried Ambien?

57
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,491
I don't want to wake up
in the middle of the Triborough Bridge

58
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:01,460
eating scrambled eggs
in my pajamas.

59
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:04,863
How those eggs got into my pajamas I'll never know.

60
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,465
You shouldn't do Groucho.

61
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,100
Seriously, you need to sleep

62
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,868
or you're gonna forget to
thank people for washing us.

63
00:04:09,902 --> 00:04:11,971
I'm seeing my guy
tomorrow at 10:00.

64
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,505
- Who's your guy?
<i>- Abe.</i>

65
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,340
- Who's Abe?
<i>- Dr. Habib.</i>

66
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,177
You're still seeing Abe?
That's wonderful, Will.

67
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,778
Everyone could use
a little therapy.

68
00:04:19,813 --> 00:04:22,047
And you a lot more than most.
I'm glad you're doing that.

69
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,651
- Well...
<i>- You've been skipping appointments?</i>

70
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,420
Sometimes.

71
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:28,021
When was the last
time you saw him?

72
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:29,456
- What's today, the 12th?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:32,158
- About four years ago.
- Why did you stop seeing him?

74
00:04:32,193 --> 00:04:34,527
- I've kept the appointments.
- What does that mean?

75
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,596
I've had an appointment every
Wednesday at 10:00. I just don't go.

76
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,665
You've been paying him
for four years?

77
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,299
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Thank God.

78
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:41,834
I have a business manager
who does that.

79
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:03,823
Why don't you read a magazine?

80
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:07,527
No, I've already read that
issue of <i>Cat Fancy</i> cover to cover

81
00:05:07,561 --> 00:05:10,229
and I'm saving <i>American Stamp Collector</i>
for a long plane ride.

82
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,564
All right.

83
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:13,332
Why not just go
to your regular doctor?

84
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,701
When I go to my internist,
he asks me questions.

85
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:18,271
It's a half-hour interview
before he puts on a stethoscope.

86
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,239
- What kinds of questions?
- I don't know.

87
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:22,708
- How you feeling?
- Asshole.

88
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,612
Here, read <i>Vegan Health</i>.

89
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:29,649
- Will?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:32,052
I'm Jack Habib.
Come on in.

91
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,720
Are you Abe's son?

92
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:35,788
- I am.
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:38,291
- <i>You, too. Come on in.</i>
- Is your dad inside?

94
00:05:38,325 --> 00:05:40,093
No.

95
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,261
I can wait out here.

96
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:44,597
My father died two years ago

97
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:46,599
and I took his practice.
Come on in.

98
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:48,468
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

99
00:05:48,503 --> 00:05:51,171
Wait, what?

100
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:55,209
Will, I'm Dr. Jacob Habib,

101
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:57,311
son of Dr. Abraham Habib.

102
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:01,549
My father passed away
and his patients now see me.

103
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,384
You've been paying me
for two years.

104
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:05,987
<i>Come on in.</i>

105
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:07,522
How old are you?

106
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:09,290
I'm 29.

107
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:10,925
Shut up.

108
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,396
- Can you write prescriptions?
- Yeah. Let's go.

109
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:18,367
- I'll be two minutes.
<i>- All right.</i>

110
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,905
So if you're 29--

111
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,507
Don't try to count backwards.

112
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:28,011
I did everything early.
So unless you're certain

113
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,180
you've got a Doogie Howser joke
I haven't heard,

114
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:32,916
why don't we just assume
it was hilarious and move on?

115
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,884
- Okay.
- So what's going on?

116
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:36,685
I need something
to help me sleep.

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,121
- Why?
- I can't sleep.

118
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:42,491
- Why?
- I don't know.

119
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:44,493
Any recent change in diet?

120
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,295
I haven't changed my diet
since college.

121
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:49,131
- You should.
- I invented a new sandwich.

122
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,100
Scrambled eggs, bacon,
and melted cheese on toast.

123
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,001
I make two of them every night
before I get into bed.

124
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:54,770
You invented an Egg McMuffin.

125
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:57,339
- <i>Getting enough exercise?</i>
- I have to scramble the eggs.

126
00:06:57,374 --> 00:06:59,675
- <i>And other than that?</i>
- No.

127
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:01,710
Look, any kind of
sleeping pill will do.

128
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,380
Sure.
Just talk a little bit?

129
00:07:04,414 --> 00:07:06,849
Oh, God, please, let's not.

130
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:11,821
- <i>You're still taking Effexor?</i>
- No.

131
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:13,289
- <i>Clonazepam?</i>
- No.

132
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,058
- <i>Ativan?</i>
- No.

133
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:18,895
Four years ago,
you were on 135mg of Effexor

134
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:21,932
- plus Clonazepam and Ativan at bedtime.
- I'm not anymore.

135
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:24,000
- Why is that?
- I was cured.

136
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,735
These are all
antianxiety medications.

137
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:27,270
And I have no more anxiety.

138
00:07:27,304 --> 00:07:28,905
Except for not
being able to sleep.

139
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:30,873
Right, so if you'll just
give me a prescription for--

140
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,375
Yeah, I'm going to.

141
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,611
- Just a few more questions.
- Okay.

142
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,180
Any extra stress at work?

143
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,315
Extra stress?

144
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:39,783
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- No.

145
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:42,386
- No extra stress?
<i>- No.</i>

146
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,388
- <i>One more question.</i>
- Sure.

147
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,058
What are you
fucking around with me for?

148
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,660
I'm sorry?

149
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:50,395
What are you fucking
around with me for?

150
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,866
- I just asked if there's any extra stress at work--
- There isn't.

151
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,567
There isn't.

152
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:57,802
What about the death threat?

153
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,237
You know about that?

154
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,139
Anyone who reads a newspaper
knows about that.

155
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:03,075
- It's truly not a big deal.
- No?

156
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,977
Jack, can I get the prescription?

157
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,480
Just tell me how a death threat
isn't a big deal.

158
00:08:07,514 --> 00:08:09,215
I used to be
a criminal prosecutor.

159
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,851
And I'm telling you nobody
who's serious about killing you

160
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,619
sends you a note
beforehand to warn you.

161
00:08:13,654 --> 00:08:16,622
The gentleman who is with you
in the waiting room, he's a bodyguard, right?

162
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,257
Yeah, but you shouldn't--
That's the--

163
00:08:18,292 --> 00:08:20,927
Our insurance company
makes that decision.

164
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,495
Based on what?

165
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,098
They have experts who determine
whether a cret is threadible--

166
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:26,499
Threat is credible.

167
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,368
And why do they think
the threat is credible?

168
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:30,270
Nine questions ago,
you said one more question.

169
00:08:30,305 --> 00:08:31,839
Why do they think
the threat is credible?

170
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:35,175
Because I changed the rules
of the comment section of our website.

171
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,145
That's all. I changed the rules
of the comment section.

172
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,447
As always,
or at least since Monday,

173
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:43,551
we end our show with your own
viewer comments on our website.

174
00:08:43,586 --> 00:08:45,386
So let's see
what we have tonight.

175
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:48,189
LollypopLollypop says,
"30 more seconds

176
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:51,525
and you would have had
that self-loathing hypocrite in tears."

177
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,830
That-- That was absolutely
not my intention.

178
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:58,465
<i>SurrendrDorothee said,
"Your Log Cabin closet case</i>

179
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,434
<i>hit the Uncle Tom
Daily Double--</i>

180
00:09:00,468 --> 00:09:04,004
a traitor to his race and a traitor
to his sexual orientation."

181
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,572
Don't blow a gasket.

182
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,509
He's plainly not a closet case.
He's openly gay.

183
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,779
I also think he showed a lot of courage
coming on the show.

184
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:15,349
Certainly more courage than it takes
to post an anonymous comment on a website.

185
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:19,186
<i>Terry Smith's coming up from Washington
with the </i>Capitol Report<i>.</i>

186
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:21,188
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

187
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:26,927
<i>We're out.</i>

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,635
- Neal!
- Believe me, those were the best two we had.

189
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:35,470
Why didn't we just
hit him in the head with a shovel?

190
00:09:35,504 --> 00:09:37,405
- We've got to talk about what just happened.
- I'm trying to.

191
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:39,574
Not the website. We've got to talk about
what happened on the air.

192
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,942
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Were you outside your body?

193
00:09:40,977 --> 00:09:42,844
I don't want to talk about it.
I want to talk about the website.

194
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,513
<i>The website's not
the problem right now.</i>

195
00:09:44,547 --> 00:09:47,582
It's my problem right now.
We're putting up these comments--

196
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:49,284
- We've heard this before.
- But we're still doing it.

197
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:52,286
It's a trade with Reese.
The page views offset the ratings drop.

198
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,822
Is there any way of knowing
if LollypopLollypop

199
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:57,058
is 10 years old?
Or a basset hound?

200
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:59,026
The reason basset hounds
have such long ears

201
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,895
is so they can waft up the scent
when they're hunting.

202
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,798
- Is there any way of knowing?
- No.

203
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,167
Is there any way of
knowing if LollypopLollypop

204
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,436
- and SurrendrDorothee are the same person?
- No.

205
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,471
Who posts comments
on the Internet more,

206
00:10:10,506 --> 00:10:12,740
- people who are content or people who are incontent?
- <i>Discontent.</i>

207
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,742
- What?
- It's discontent, not incontent.

208
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:18,078
- It's about 30-1 incontent.
- Discontent.

209
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,947
Final question:
In your wildest dreams,

210
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:22,816
can you imagine Walter Cronkite
saying LollypopLollypop

211
00:10:22,884 --> 00:10:24,551
as many times as I have
in the last 10 minutes?

212
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:27,153
Not unless he was in an
a cappella doo-wop group, no.

213
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,222
He wasn't.
Here's what I'd love.

214
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:30,857
You want to join
the discussion, fine.

215
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,059
I want to know your name,
age, occupation,

216
00:10:33,094 --> 00:10:34,661
- and level of education.
- Oh, God.

217
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,665
The thing about the Internet is
it's a populist tool.

218
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:40,868
Populists have names, too.
William Jennings Bryan, Will Rogers, me.

219
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,337
- Will.
- Unless you're Deep Throat

220
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:45,507
or in the Witness Protection Program,
anonymity is cowardice.

221
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,743
You're in a mob.
You're lobbing smack from the cheap seats.

222
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,278
Don't we have bigger fish
to fry than the--

223
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:51,447
Yes, but we can fry
more than one fish at a time.

224
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,849
And how could we possibly
verify someone's name,

225
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,852
- age, occupation, and level of education?
- Neal?

226
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:59,655
We implement a third-party
verification service.

227
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:01,689
All you had to say was,
"We can't"

228
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:04,325
- and the conversation would have been over.
- So it is possible?

229
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,627
It's what the IRS uses
when you're filing online.

230
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,195
Talk to me, Tonto.

231
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,130
- We can do it if you want.
- Oh, I want.

232
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,100
Won't the result be that nobody
posts comments on our website anymore?

233
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:16,370
First of all, oh, no. What will we do without
feedback from SurrendrDorothee?

234
00:11:16,405 --> 00:11:19,941
And second, the result will be our website
will ghettoize every other website.

235
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,544
The result will be civility
in the public square

236
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,945
<i>and a triumph of populism.</i>

237
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,448
I'm going to single-handedly
fix the Internet.

238
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:28,717
- What could possibly go wrong?
- <i>Will!</i>

239
00:11:28,752 --> 00:11:31,253
- What?
- We have to talk about what just happened.

240
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,655
No, we don't.
We're just gonna move on.

241
00:11:35,725 --> 00:11:37,359
And when did you get
the death threat?

242
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:40,329
I don't know.
A day after the mosque interview.

243
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:43,933
<i>We know that an Islamic trend
is to build large mosques</i>

244
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,402
on the cherished sites
of conquered lands.

245
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:49,172
- You're talking about Cordoba.
<i>- That's exactly right.</i>

246
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:52,608
When Muslims conquered Cordoba,
Spain, they tore down churches

247
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:55,311
and synagogues and put
mosques in their place.

248
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:58,614
Ms. Greer, Muslims conquered
Cordoba in the year 712.

249
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:02,685
Do you think we can call something that
last happened in the 8th century a trend?

250
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:04,953
She'll say, "Why does it have
to be at Ground Zero?"

251
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,389
Anyone being honest about
the prospect of a mosque

252
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:09,491
being built so close
to Ground Zero

253
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,827
would say it
instinctually feels wrong.

254
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,362
<i>Is it legal?
Of course it is.</i>

255
00:12:14,397 --> 00:12:16,631
Is it wrong?
Of course it is.

256
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,800
It should be built somewhere
where the 9/11 families

257
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:22,303
don't have to feel the agony of having
a shrine to their loved ones stomped upon.

258
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:25,706
All over America we're seeing
the influence of creeping Islam.

259
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,308
We are?

260
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,644
What about those who would
impose Sharia law?

261
00:12:29,678 --> 00:12:31,646
Women can be stoned to death
for committing adultery.

262
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,383
No, they can't. Actual laws are
the only laws that are enforceable,

263
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:37,952
including the one that says
you can't create religious laws.

264
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:40,722
And the US is in no more danger
of coming under Sharia law

265
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,190
than it is the rules
of <i>Fight Club</i>.

266
00:12:42,224 --> 00:12:43,692
Let me ask you something.

267
00:12:43,726 --> 00:12:45,928
Muslims the world over
are fighting a civil war

268
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:47,897
over the direction
Islam is taking.

269
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:50,466
<i>Are you going to be stationed
at the door of that mosque</i>

270
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,768
<i>to turn radicals away?</i>

271
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,971
Can you guarantee
that the current imam

272
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:57,106
is going to be the same imam
10 years from now?

273
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,143
It's worth pointing out that it's not a mosque.
It's a community center.

274
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,312
<i>I'm not sure why you think
that makes it better.</i>

275
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,482
What business does a community center
have in the religion business?

276
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:07,217
And then pivot
to the larger point.

277
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:10,120
I want the art and graphics
reviewed three times before air.

278
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:12,289
<i>Ms. Greer,
you mentioned creeping Islam.</i>

279
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,225
Are you concerned about
creeping Christianity?

280
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,128
Only that it's not creeping fast enough.

281
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,731
Okay, here are some things
done on American soil

282
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,399
in the name of Christianity.

283
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,001
<i>The Ku Klux Klan burned down
black churches,</i>

284
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,538
<i>raped women,
murdered civil rights workers,</i>

285
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:30,375
<i>murdered children,
and terrorized communities for over a century.</i>

286
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,777
The neo-Nazis all acted
and continue to act

287
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,180
in the name of white
Christian supremacy.

288
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,781
The Army of God fatally attacks

289
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,317
<i>abortion clinics and doctors
across the country.</i>

290
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,853
<i>The Covenant, The Sword,
and The Arm of the Lord</i>

291
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,922
<i>targets local police
and federal agents.</i>

292
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,290
The federal building
in Oklahoma City,

293
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,793
the attempted assassination
of Ronald Reagan,

294
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,763
and the successful assassinations
of Martin Luther King,

295
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,766
John F. Kennedy,
John Lennon,

296
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,002
and Abraham Lincoln,

297
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,837
all perpetrated by Christians.

298
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,072
Ms. Greer,
we weren't attacked by Muslims.

299
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,541
We were attacked by sociopaths.

300
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,410
And I, for one,
would join you in protesting

301
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:06,578
a community center
for the criminally insane.

302
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:10,749
But no one is suggesting
building one.

303
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,451
Here's the thing
about the Japanese.

304
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,886
Where we tend to hype things up,
they go the other direction.

305
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:16,655
You think they're
lowballing Fukushima?

306
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,989
I don't know anything
about nuclear reactors,

307
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,958
<i>and I'm not at all
involved in this story.</i>

308
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,062
I'm just saying I wouldn't
take their word for it it's a level five.

309
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:26,399
Excuse me, Will. There's a comment
on your website you need to see.

310
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:28,835
Ah, now I get to say who is it from?
What do they do?

311
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,105
It's serious.

312
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,379
From about 25 minutes ago.

313
00:14:39,414 --> 00:14:43,384
<i>"Fucking sand niggers should
get herded and slaughtered.</i>

314
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:44,951
I've got a bullet for you, too.

315
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:46,519
You think I'm fucking around?

316
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,089
2 Hudson Street, 27."

317
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:51,591
- Is 2 Hudson 27--
- It's my address and apartment number.

318
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:54,494
Alice Cynkar,
an English professor at OSU.

319
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:55,796
It wasn't written
by an English professor

320
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,264
and it wasn't written
by Alice Cynkar.

321
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,266
How much effort does it take
to scam the new system?

322
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,701
You've got to want it pretty bad.

323
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,936
Millie, it's Mackenzie.

324
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,172
Would you tell him we're
coming right up, please?

325
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:08,510
They could have
stolen our password.

326
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,479
- How hard is that?
- Hard.

327
00:15:10,513 --> 00:15:12,781
We implemented complex
password requirements

328
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:15,917
on the site because we knew
it was catnip for some sophomore at MIT.

329
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,920
It would take an average
computer 57 days to get in.

330
00:15:18,954 --> 00:15:20,755
And that's with someone
who knows what they're doing.

331
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,256
How many days has
the new system been up?

332
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:24,058
- Three.
- Jesus.

333
00:15:24,092 --> 00:15:26,060
- Will.
- Everybody relax.

334
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:28,129
Neal just said it.
It's a college kid pledging a frat.

335
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:29,664
<i>With a death threat? No.</i>

336
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:32,100
Charlie, I want a body on him
until this guy's in handcuffs.

337
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:34,069
- No way.
- <i>You're not gonna have a choice.</i>

338
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,371
- The insurance company makes that call.
- Come on.

339
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:39,307
Listen to me.
This goes to AWM security right now.

340
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:41,542
Security's got to show it
to the insurance company.

341
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,544
And that's going to trigger
some kind of protection.

342
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:46,713
Wouldn't it make more sense for me
just to wear a different disguise every day?

343
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:47,881
One more thing.

344
00:15:47,916 --> 00:15:49,716
There's gonna be a tabloid story.

345
00:15:49,751 --> 00:15:51,551
- Good. Yeah.
- What did I do?

346
00:15:51,586 --> 00:15:54,655
Is it possible Maggie
filed a complaint with HR

347
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:57,357
saying that you created
a hostile work environment?

348
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:00,060
No, it's not possible.
Maggie wouldn't complain if her hair was on fire.

349
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:01,361
Someone else did on her behalf.

350
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,630
And it was a while ago
before you got here.

351
00:16:03,664 --> 00:16:05,198
Thanks.

352
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,466
Would you excuse us for a second?

353
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,369
Sure.

354
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:12,838
Why don't we try to fully investigate
the anatomy of these stories?

355
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,340
- No, we're gonna fully investigate Will.
- Of course.

356
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,410
I want you to assign a team
to do opposition research on Will.

357
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,946
Let's call it
Operation Involuntary Colonoscopy.

358
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,017
I just want to know what the next
tabloid story is before it happens.

359
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:26,919
You won't be able to pin
nothing on me, Mugsy.

360
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,522
'Cause I've lived my life
straight as the Kingston Trio.

361
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,657
I'm not fucking around!

362
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:34,994
You know, when you're grumpier than I am,
we've switched roles.

363
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,429
Ask him what's the current
state of the reactors.

364
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,904
What did he say?

365
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,943
- What did he say?
- His daughter's on the diving team.

366
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,212
They came in second
at regionals.

367
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:57,482
- Did he understand the question?
- Did you?

368
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,352
I haven't spoken to him in two years.
We're catching up.

369
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,422
How does a company like TEPCO
not have a spokesperson who speaks English?

370
00:17:03,456 --> 00:17:04,990
I don't know.

371
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,625
What is the current state
of the reactors?

372
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,461
Tanaka-san...

373
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,173
Units one and three have had explosions
due to hydrogen buildup.

374
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,175
<i>They're currently stable,
but they're not safe to enter.</i>

375
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,811
<i>What are they doing
to contain the situation?</i>

376
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,483
What's going on with Will?

377
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,984
Internal security is handling it.

378
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,486
But I have to give you
a rotten assignment.

379
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,654
- You got gum in your hair again?
- No.

380
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,356
Yes, but I got it out.

381
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,725
I need you to do
opposition research on Will.

382
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,260
Seriously?

383
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,296
About a year ago, somebody filed
a complaint with HR on your behalf.

384
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,566
I know what that was. Will didn't
do anything wrong. This is ridiculous.

385
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,202
I know, but Charlie wants to know
what else is out there so he can--

386
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,771
- Will knows we're doing this?
- Of course.

387
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,239
- And he's okay with it?
- No, he hates it.

388
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,241
- Fantastic.
- Go to work.

389
00:17:58,443 --> 00:18:00,111
- Have you done this before?
- Yeah.

390
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:03,414
- Where do we start?
- Tell me about the complaint.

391
00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:07,385
There was a desk producer who saw
Will yell at me about something.

392
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,387
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

393
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,055
What?

394
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,858
Doesn't matter.

395
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,599
- I mixed up Georgia the state with--
- No.

396
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,634
- Yes, Georgia the country.
- And this was...

397
00:18:23,668 --> 00:18:25,636
- Yup. This isn't about me.
- ...during the invasion?

398
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,604
You thought the Russians
invaded Atlanta?

399
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,106
In retrospect,
it seems farfetched.

400
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,541
But that wasn't what
he was actually mad about.

401
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:35,412
The wife of a board member died
and Will asked me to send flowers.

402
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:39,682
I wrote on the card,
"I'm so sorry about your loss. LOL."

403
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:43,186
- LOL?
- I thought it meant "lots of love."

404
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,189
How are you still working here?

405
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:47,224
I dodge bullets.

406
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:49,426
Here comes a bullet.
Boom! I'm over here.

407
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,362
Ping! Here comes another bullet.
Boom! I'm over here.

408
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,736
Ask him if TEPCO's gonna try
to keep the reactors going.

409
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,171
Tanaka-san...

410
00:19:12,183 --> 00:19:13,584
They're classified at level five

411
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,220
and they think they'll be able
to get the reactor going.

412
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,561
Guys, do me a favor
and let us have a minute?

413
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,820
Anybody know where
Sloan Sabbith is?

414
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,156
- Sloan!
- Shh!

415
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,158
She's on the phone.

416
00:20:26,193 --> 00:20:28,394
All right, she's off the phone.

417
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:34,200
Here are the notes.
It's gonna go to level seven.

418
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,935
- Holy shit.
- You got a minute?

419
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,038
Fukushima's a lot worse
than they're telling you.

420
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,707
- I need you to fill in for Elliot tonight.
- This is what the Japanese do.

421
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:43,544
- They-- Wait, what?
- I need you to fill in for Elliot at 10:00.

422
00:20:43,578 --> 00:20:45,679
- Why?
- His five-year-old's having a tonsillectomy today.

423
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,347
Elliot's gonna spend the night
in the hospital with her.

424
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,850
- Was it an emergency?
- No, it was scheduled a week ago.

425
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,584
And you're just getting
around to this now?

426
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,186
- I...
- Forgot?

427
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,022
- Yes.
- You have a staff. They can write these things down.

428
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:58,424
They can, but I have to
remember to tell them to.

429
00:20:58,459 --> 00:21:00,926
So what do you say?
You're my first and only choice.

430
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,828
- What about Jerome?
<i>- He's in Bermuda.</i>

431
00:21:02,863 --> 00:21:04,697
- Kathy?
- It's her parents' 50th anniversary.

432
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,099
- Taylor?
- Bronchitis.

433
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:08,101
- So...
- Yes, you were my fourth and only choice.

434
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,003
I can't host Elliot's show.
Don't be ridiculous.

435
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:11,605
<i>You host your own
show at 4:00.</i>

436
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,440
- About financial news.
- You're expanding.

437
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:16,844
Oh, come on.
I gained four freaking pounds.

438
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,479
No, professor.

439
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,015
- Right, expanding.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

440
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:23,884
- No, I'm not doing it.
- Your copy will be written for you to approve.

441
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,286
You've got Marco Rubio,
Sandra Bernhard--

442
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,688
Sandra Bernhard's been
dead for 100 years.

443
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,824
- That's Sarah Bernhardt.
- She'd be a good guest.

444
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,125
- I hate my life.
- Hmm?

445
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,661
Nothing.
And the spokesperson for TEPCO.

446
00:21:33,695 --> 00:21:35,863
- I just got off the phone with him.
- See? You're perfect.

447
00:21:35,897 --> 00:21:37,865
I was just doing a favor for these guys.
I don't know anything about--

448
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:40,034
Thank God my first five choices
weren't available.

449
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:41,502
I thought
there were only three.

450
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,970
Let's not get
caught up in the math.

451
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,972
If you want a wardrobe change
after the 4:00,

452
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:47,174
we have Gucci ready to
send over some choices.

453
00:21:47,242 --> 00:21:49,877
- Gucci?
<i>- A whole rack of choices.</i>

454
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,813
Your copy will be ready for your approval after 9:00

455
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:56,384
along with your questions,
and I will be in your ear the whole time.

456
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,586
Except for Fukushima,
you're mostly throwing to packages.

457
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:01,156
- They've been lowballing the radiation levels.
- I'd take their word for it.

458
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,592
- The Japanese have some experience with radiation.
- You think that's something--

459
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,894
That is not something
you should mention on the air.

460
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,370
- Oh, God.
- Mr. Will McAvoy.

461
00:22:14,404 --> 00:22:15,905
You're not here to do my taxes,
right?

462
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:17,373
My name's Lonny Church.

463
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:20,276
Mr. Horn at AWM Security
told you I'd be here at this time.

464
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:21,644
I'll tell you right now
I'm gonna hate this.

465
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,279
I'll tell you now
I'm not gonna care.

466
00:22:23,313 --> 00:22:26,015
- Let's go in my office for a minute.
- Sure.

467
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,018
It's not a real threat.

468
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:30,821
I don't make that decision.

469
00:22:30,855 --> 00:22:33,190
Lonny Church?
Did you play college football?

470
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,525
Yes, I did.
Defensive tackle.

471
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,094
Started three years
for Clemson.

472
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:39,963
- And then?
- Got drafted in the eighth round by the Bengals.

473
00:22:39,998 --> 00:22:42,833
- And then?
- Got cut five weeks into training camp.

474
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,602
<i>Excellent.</i>

475
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:46,370
Joined the Army, became an MP.

476
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:49,173
- <i>Where were you deployed?</i>
- New Jersey.

477
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,042
You see a lot of action
in New Jersey?

478
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:52,443
See a lot of action
in your studio?

479
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,944
I'll be doing the jokes, okay?

480
00:22:53,979 --> 00:22:56,313
- After you were discharged?
- Honorably.

481
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,082
I joined Blue North Security.

482
00:22:58,116 --> 00:22:59,917
Who else's body
have you guarded?

483
00:22:59,951 --> 00:23:01,819
- We don't talk about that.
- Okay.

484
00:23:01,853 --> 00:23:03,854
Kanye.
It was awesome.

485
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:05,489
<i>Are you armed?</i>

486
00:23:05,523 --> 00:23:07,825
I secure my weapon in a gun safe
when I come in the building.

487
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,695
Keep it there.
I really don't want an armed guard.

488
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:13,264
Maybe if you were drafted in
the first four rounds, I'd feel safer.

489
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,466
- Mr. McAvoy.
- You can call me Will.

490
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:16,634
Yeah, I was gonna
do that anyway.

491
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,369
I know you're used
to being the boss.

492
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:21,372
<i>But you're not anymore.
At least for a little while.</i>

493
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:22,707
How long?

494
00:23:22,741 --> 00:23:24,809
Until my colleagues chase down
the source of the threat

495
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:27,512
or, of course, if you've been
successfully assassinated.

496
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,948
- A joke?
- What'd you think?

497
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:32,350
It was all right.
How does this work?

498
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:35,787
I pick you up at your home in the morning
and escort you to your office.

499
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:38,122
Then I pick you up at your office at night
and escort you to your home.

500
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,959
I'm with you any place
that's an unsecured area.

501
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:42,527
What's an unsecured area?

502
00:23:42,562 --> 00:23:44,596
Anyplace that isn't
your home or your office.

503
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,266
I'm single.
What about a date?

504
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,468
I don't think we should
get romantically involved.

505
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:51,603
You get one joke a day.

506
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:53,038
- Come on in.
- I say that.

507
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,740
- I'm sorry. You got a second?
- Yeah.

508
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,208
I'll leave you.

509
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,977
Sloan, this is Lonny.
You'll see him around.

510
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:01,947
- Good to meet you.
- Wow.

511
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:04,849
- Can I tap your chest?
- Sure.

512
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:08,720
Holy cow.

513
00:24:08,754 --> 00:24:11,156
- Have you felt his pecs?
- No, I haven't yet.

514
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,158
I'll be downstairs.

515
00:24:15,494 --> 00:24:17,562
So I'm hosting
Elliot's show tonight.

516
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:18,863
I know. I'm the one
who suggested you.

517
00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:21,098
You really think I can do it?

518
00:24:21,133 --> 00:24:23,967
No, I have no idea.
So we're gonna find out.

519
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:27,070
All right. Well, your exuberant
confidence notwithstanding,

520
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,472
- I have the spokesperson--
- From TEPCO, I know.

521
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:32,475
<i>He just told me, off the record,
that reactor three</i>

522
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:35,645
is causing what is a level seven,
not a level five radiation leak.

523
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,914
<i>What's the trick to getting him
to say it on the record?</i>

524
00:24:37,948 --> 00:24:41,284
There is no trick.
You just don't stop until he tells the truth.

525
00:24:41,318 --> 00:24:43,286
What do you mean
you don't stop?

526
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,787
I mean you don't stop.

527
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:47,790
Sloan, I watch your show at 4:00
and you're brilliant.

528
00:24:47,825 --> 00:24:50,827
But you let guests say things
that I know you know aren't true.

529
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,931
And then you just move on.
Ask the damn follow-up

530
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:56,566
and then demonstrate with facts
how the guest is lying.

531
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,368
You can't just sit there
and be a facilitator

532
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:00,670
for whatever bullshit the guest
wants to feed your viewers.

533
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:03,540
They're not coming on to plug a movie.
It's not Jimmy Kimmel.

534
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:06,610
You knowingly, passively,
allow someone to lie on your air,

535
00:25:06,644 --> 00:25:09,479
and maybe you're not a drug dealer,
but you're sure as hell

536
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:12,082
the guy who drives the dealer
around in your car.

537
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,918
So maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't.
Show me something.

538
00:25:16,754 --> 00:25:19,289
- Got it.
- Do you?

539
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,025
Yeah.

540
00:25:23,862 --> 00:25:26,263
<i>I just-- I don't know.
I was in a bad mood.</i>

541
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:29,199
<i>Honestly, I was just
trying to motivate her.</i>

542
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,569
<i>She's the last person
who needs motivation,</i>

543
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:34,172
- <i>so it just ended up...</i>
- Scaring her.

544
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,141
I hate that
people are scared of me.

545
00:25:37,176 --> 00:25:39,277
- I absolutely hate it.
<i>- Why?</i>

546
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:41,679
Why do I hate when
people are scared of me?

547
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:43,414
For the same reason
everybody does.

548
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:44,883
Everybody doesn't.

549
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,419
Some people like it.
Most people don't care.

550
00:25:47,453 --> 00:25:49,988
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't like it.

551
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:52,056
And I'm pretty sure
I scared Sloan

552
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:55,727
because she's a veteran reporter
who's never done anything like what she did.

553
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,428
What's the condition
of each reactor?

554
00:26:02,634 --> 00:26:06,236
- All six reactors are in stable condition.
- Great, let's wrap up.

555
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:08,071
<i>What about the partial
meltdown at reactor three?</i>

556
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:10,574
Wrap up for me.

557
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,208
Excuse me,
that's not what I asked.

558
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:13,709
<i>I'm asking him specifically</i>

559
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,444
<i>about the core damage
at reactor three.</i>

560
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:18,047
What's happening?

561
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,821
We know of no core damage
at any of the reactors.

562
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,589
That's not what
Mr. Tanaka just said.

563
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:29,592
He said our engineers can't
get close enough to confirm that.

564
00:26:29,627 --> 00:26:31,494
Please translate
exactly what I'm asking

565
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,163
and exactly what
Mr. Tanaka is answering,

566
00:26:33,197 --> 00:26:34,765
including what I'm saying now,

567
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,000
because I want him to be aware
that he's being misrepresented.

568
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:40,638
Miss Sabbith, I am translating.
He is not being mis--

569
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,240
Ask him if he believed the radiation levels
are going to a seven.

570
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,276
Please, please, don't go rogue.

571
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,619
<i>The radiation
was categorized at level four</i>

572
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,255
and then recategorized
at level five.

573
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,190
<i>And that's where
it should remain.</i>

574
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:02,327
Ma'am, he didn't say that's
where it should remain. You did.

575
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:04,562
Furthermore, he told me--
You know what? I'm just gonna--

576
00:27:04,597 --> 00:27:07,699
Tanaka-san...

577
00:27:10,636 --> 00:27:14,372
And now we're doing
the broadcast in Japanese.

578
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,948
We'll be right back after this.
Just say that.

579
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:26,118
Say it in English.

580
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,722
She just--
Put me back!

581
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:31,924
Mr. Tanaka, your company had
this incident rated at level four,

582
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:33,926
then adjusted to level five.

583
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,262
How confident are you that
that'll be the highest level we see?

584
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:38,564
At least we're back to English.

585
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:44,036
At this point, we see no reason

586
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:45,772
that level will need
future escalation.

587
00:27:45,806 --> 00:27:48,408
Well, that's simply not what Mr. Tanaka
told me on the phone earlier today.

588
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:50,444
- No, no.
<i>- When I spoke with him earlier,</i>

589
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:53,280
he said there's enough evidence
to raise the level to seven.

590
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:55,650
- Go back to Japanese.
- And now he's not saying it, so I am.

591
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,685
- Oh, my God!
- So there it is.

592
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,320
<i>The Fukushima nuclear
power plant is saying</i>

593
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:01,989
<i>that the level four radiation leak
that was raised to level five</i>

594
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:04,391
has a chance at being
raised to level seven,

595
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:06,460
which is the difference
between life and gruesome death.

596
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:09,596
We'll be back after this
with Sarah Bernhardt.

597
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:11,298
Sandra Bernhard, you idiot!

598
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,300
Oh, what the hell
does it matter?

599
00:28:31,387 --> 00:28:33,622
- Okay...
- 'Sup?

600
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,825
Okay, I know we were on
sketchy ground ethically

601
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:38,994
and linguistically, but--

602
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:42,030
Whatever you're gonna say,
save it for another 10 seconds.

603
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:43,598
What happens in 10 seconds?

604
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,300
Just hang on for another
five seconds and know

605
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,201
that we've all been there
at one point or another.

606
00:28:47,236 --> 00:28:49,037
What happens in five seconds?

607
00:28:49,071 --> 00:28:51,906
What in the name of holy fuck
were you thinking about?!

608
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,941
First, let me say that Don
was not responsible for that.

609
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:56,677
Yeah, when you severed
communication with the EP,

610
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:58,846
you pretty much absolved him
of responsibility.

611
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:02,116
But that doesn't make the cut
of the top three calamities

612
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,985
- that just occurred.
- Charlie--

613
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:07,054
I, along with most people
who don't live in Japan,

614
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:09,990
am not fluent in Japanese,
so I have to ask:

615
00:29:10,025 --> 00:29:12,326
Did you just make up statements

616
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,361
for somebody
we had live on our air?

617
00:29:14,396 --> 00:29:17,765
- I didn't make them up.
- About a deadly radiation leak?

618
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,233
I didn't make them up.

619
00:29:19,267 --> 00:29:21,335
He told me the reactor
was going to a seven.

620
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,437
When? Tonight?

621
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm asking honestly
because there was a portion

622
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:30,010
of the broadcast that turned
into a Kurosawa movie.

623
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:32,312
These things are measured
on a scale of zero to seven.

624
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:34,881
Five is Three Mile Island,
a seven is Chernobyl.

625
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:38,018
On air, did he say the reactors
were going to seven?

626
00:29:38,053 --> 00:29:39,486
He said it to me
in the preinterview.

627
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:41,155
And then the company stuck
an interpreter next to him,

628
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,690
and I think her job
was more than interpreting

629
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:44,225
because she wasn't
accurately translating--

630
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,627
We don't report
what you think, Sloan.

631
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:49,730
The guy said
all six reactors are stable.

632
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:52,166
The Japanese are
a deferential people.

633
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:54,602
It's very hard for them to explain
when they've done something wrong.

634
00:29:54,636 --> 00:29:57,238
I don't give a shit,
Madame Butterfly!

635
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:59,207
<i>And right now the Japanese,</i>

636
00:29:59,242 --> 00:30:01,309
<i>who are reading an online report
of your report,</i>

637
00:30:01,344 --> 00:30:03,445
are fleeing from
their fucking homes.

638
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:06,749
Now tell me what he said
tonight on air.

639
00:30:14,726 --> 00:30:17,194
He said the reactors
were at five.

640
00:30:17,228 --> 00:30:20,564
But you said he said
they would move to seven.

641
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:22,499
I made it clear he said that
during the preinterview.

642
00:30:22,534 --> 00:30:24,201
First of all,
let's not kid ourselves.

643
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,603
There was nothing that was clear
about that interview.

644
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:29,140
He said it to me, and he said it
to a conference room full of staffers.

645
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:31,308
- The staffers weren't there.
- The staffers were not there.

646
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:33,944
I sent them out so we could
speak privately and off--

647
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,749
No, finish that sentence.

648
00:30:38,783 --> 00:30:41,084
Off the record.

649
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,388
Good luck trying to get a source
to talk to you off the record again.

650
00:30:44,455 --> 00:30:47,423
You have no value to me
as a reporter now.

651
00:30:47,458 --> 00:30:49,359
- Charlie!
- And I have to suspend you.

652
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:51,027
- <i>Come on.</i>
- What?

653
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:54,864
I have to suspend you while
we bring in outside investigators

654
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:57,934
to comb through every report
you've filed in the last two years

655
00:30:57,968 --> 00:30:59,869
to find out what other shit
you made up.

656
00:30:59,903 --> 00:31:02,738
I didn't make anything up.
I would never make anything up.

657
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:05,675
I know that and you know that
and he knows that,

658
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,343
but why the hell should
anyone else know that?

659
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:09,312
You're suspended with pay
until I figure out--

660
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:11,614
- They were lying about a public safety issue.
- You're suspended with pay--

661
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,382
I don't want the goddamn pay!

662
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,018
Don't front off with me, girl!

663
00:31:15,052 --> 00:31:18,455
- Don't call me girl, sir.
- Hey!

664
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,892
Everybody calm the fuck down.

665
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:36,809
Sarah Bernhardt
was a turn-of-the-century

666
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:40,044
stage and film actress
from France.

667
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,014
Sandra Bernhard is a...

668
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:45,850
I don't know what the hell.

669
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,952
There's no way she does that if
I hadn't given her my awesome pep talk.

670
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:20,553
<i>Are you close with Sloan?</i>

671
00:32:20,588 --> 00:32:22,155
- Are we close?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

672
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,890
- Why?
- Just asking.

673
00:32:23,924 --> 00:32:26,859
- You seem very protective.
- We didn't used to be.

674
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:28,494
But she's become, I don't know.

675
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:32,398
I don't know,
like a little sister to me or something.

676
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,200
Your father was
an abusive alcoholic?

677
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:37,002
What?

678
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:40,105
<i>Your father,
he was an abusive alcoholic?</i>

679
00:32:40,139 --> 00:32:42,174
I didn't say that.

680
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:43,809
But he was, right?

681
00:32:43,843 --> 00:32:46,945
You got that in the 40 minutes

682
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,648
that I've been sitting here that
seem like a week and a half?

683
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:51,049
It's in the notes my dad left.

684
00:32:51,084 --> 00:32:52,751
<i>Can I have a prescription now?</i>

685
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:54,419
- He hit you?
<i>- Come on.</i>

686
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:55,687
He hit you, right?

687
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,856
How many times did you
see <i>Good Will Hunting</i>?

688
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,958
- He hit you?
<i>- Yes.</i>

689
00:32:59,993 --> 00:33:02,061
- He hit your mother?
- Yes.

690
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:05,631
<i>You have a brother and two sisters.
He hit them, right?</i>

691
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,467
Look, he didn't hit anybody once
I was old enough to hit him back.

692
00:33:08,502 --> 00:33:10,403
<i>And when was that?</i>

693
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:14,875
Will, how old were you
when you had to protect

694
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,711
your mother, your brother,

695
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,413
<i>and your two little sisters</i>

696
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:23,617
<i>from a grown man
who was drunk and violent?</i>

697
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,958
Fifth grade.

698
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,828
I cracked a bottle of Dewar's
across his face.

699
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:39,299
It's in your notes.
Why are you pursuing this line of--

700
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,435
I'm not trying
to be an asshole.

701
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:43,003
I just want a sleeping pill.

702
00:33:43,037 --> 00:33:45,539
<i>I'm gonna give you one,
but I doubt it's gonna work.</i>

703
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:47,807
Let's give it a try.

704
00:33:47,842 --> 00:33:51,043
You've got another 15 minutes
on your session.

705
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:52,478
I didn't come here
for a session.

706
00:33:52,513 --> 00:33:54,580
You could have gotten sleeping pills
from your internist.

707
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:56,182
Shit, you could have
got them online.

708
00:33:56,216 --> 00:33:59,419
I didn't go to my internist
because he asks too many questions.

709
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,355
You didn't go to your internist because
he doesn't ask you the right questions.

710
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:03,690
I didn't come here
for a session.

711
00:34:03,724 --> 00:34:06,159
I think you did.

712
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,000
I'm checking on
the opposition research.

713
00:34:15,035 --> 00:34:17,103
Maggie was detained by the police

714
00:34:17,137 --> 00:34:18,738
for attempting to blow up
her parents' house.

715
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,073
He's overstating it.

716
00:34:20,107 --> 00:34:22,108
My cousins and I wanted
to shoot guns at soda cans.

717
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:24,043
Where did you place
the soda cans?

718
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:26,179
- On top of the propane tanks.
<i>- Which were in front of?</i>

719
00:34:26,213 --> 00:34:28,881
The diesel fuel combine.
But I'm an excellent shot.

720
00:34:28,915 --> 00:34:30,549
The Deep South could have used you
when the Russians invaded.

721
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,185
Will. How's the opposition
research on Will?

722
00:34:33,253 --> 00:34:36,889
He once needed lenses for driving,
then didn't.

723
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:38,624
So he probably had Lasik surgery.

724
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:40,593
He did.

725
00:34:40,627 --> 00:34:42,528
He registered for the New York Marathon,
but didn't finish.

726
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:45,063
My fault.
I twisted my ankle at the starting line.

727
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:47,099
He carried me to the first aid tent.
What else?

728
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:50,536
- He was hospitalized with tuberculosis.
- Already knew that.

729
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:54,273
He was credited
on a country album as a guitarist.

730
00:34:54,308 --> 00:34:56,809
He's an accomplished guitarist who
occasionally jams with Leonard Cohen.

731
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,879
He got a C-minus
in Sociology of Emotion.

732
00:34:59,913 --> 00:35:02,715
It was a clerical mistake.
He never registered for the class.

733
00:35:02,749 --> 00:35:05,084
- Then a C-minus is pretty good.
- I need something I can use.

734
00:35:05,118 --> 00:35:07,520
Wait, are we trying to protect Will
or give you ammunition?

735
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:09,422
Thought we could do both.

736
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:12,959
He contributed $250 to
the failed primary campaign

737
00:35:12,993 --> 00:35:14,627
of a congressional candidate
in Nebraska.

738
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,529
- <i>While he was a journalist?</i>
- No.

739
00:35:16,563 --> 00:35:17,963
Nothing I can do with that.

740
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:20,733
I mean, they--
Nothing they can do with that.

741
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,134
Oh, the candidate
was a Republican.

742
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:23,536
- So's Will.
- What?

743
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:24,937
He's a registered Republican.

744
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:27,206
The four of you weren't
able to uncover that?

745
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,874
We weren't looking.

746
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:32,044
He was a speechwriter for Bush 41.
What did you think he was?

747
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:33,879
I just thought he did that
as a public service.

748
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:35,747
Or to mess with him
like in <i>The Sting</i>.

749
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:38,283
That's nothing like what
happened in <i>The Sting</i>.

750
00:35:38,318 --> 00:35:40,952
Jim got kicked out of
his a study abroad semester.

751
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:43,188
- He went to the Arctic Circle.
- I wanted to see the penguins.

752
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:45,323
- <i>Those are in the Antarctic.</i>
- Lesson learned.

753
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:46,824
Why'd you get kicked out?

754
00:35:46,892 --> 00:35:50,094
You're not allowed to
fraternize with the Inuit.

755
00:35:50,128 --> 00:35:52,396
He tried to score
with an Eskimo.

756
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,131
I was just trying--

757
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:57,601
I was just trying to get past
the disappointment with the penguins.

758
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:00,904
All right, so there's nothing so far.

759
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,374
Fox offered him
a ton of money in 2006

760
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,076
to come to LA
and get into late-night.

761
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,277
- A talk show?
- Yeah.

762
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:08,245
He'd have been good at that.

763
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,748
All right,
get back to the news.

764
00:36:16,222 --> 00:36:18,223
- Did you say 2006?
- Yeah.

765
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:20,158
- How far did it get?
- A deal memo.

766
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:21,560
- You sure?
- Yeah.

767
00:36:21,594 --> 00:36:23,862
All right.

768
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,533
You know that this is stupid.

769
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:29,469
Just go do your jobs.

770
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,426
I've just heard
something I can't believe.

771
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,594
Why don't you
attack this woman?

772
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:54,529
She doesn't seem
that threatening to me.

773
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:57,633
She's incredibly threatening.
My life is in constant danger when she's around.

774
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,601
- I'm Lonny Church.
- Mackenzie McHale.

775
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,503
- Attack!
- Nah.

776
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:03,972
Look, I'll be here at 9:00
unless you're leaving the building.

777
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,842
In which case, press pound five
on your phone and I'll be here.

778
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:09,010
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

779
00:37:11,247 --> 00:37:13,014
Fox offered you
a late-night talk show.

780
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:15,984
- Great, when do I start?
- Five years ago.

781
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:17,919
They offered you the show
when we were together.

782
00:37:17,953 --> 00:37:20,588
It was gonna take you to LA
and it got as far as the deal memo.

783
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:22,723
What is it you think
you've uncovered?

784
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:26,160
This whole time you've enjoyed
making me feel guilty

785
00:37:26,194 --> 00:37:28,195
for ruining the life
we would have had together

786
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:32,232
when, in fact, you never had
any intention of marrying me.

787
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,634
<i>No intention of marrying me.</i>

788
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:35,968
<i>I mean, you never
even mentioned it.</i>

789
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,770
You were just gonna go to LA
and leave a note?

790
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:40,173
Let me tell you something,
the days of you being able

791
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:42,876
to lord my mistake over me
are behind us.

792
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,380
I've lived a life
that is good and pure.

793
00:37:46,448 --> 00:37:48,950
You were deceiving me
while I was deceiving you.

794
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:51,419
You never had any intention of--
What's this?

795
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,912
I didn't tell you
about the Fox offer

796
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:18,814
because it was never real.
I knew I was being used as leverage,

797
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:20,249
and I didn't want
to be embarrassed

798
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:23,486
in front of you
when it went away.

799
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,656
I was still trying
to impress you.

800
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,826
The ring was meant for me?

801
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:35,031
But I've lived a life
that's good and pure.

802
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:37,567
Except for...

803
00:38:37,602 --> 00:38:39,369
Cheating on you.

804
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,972
- Could you speak up?
- Cheating on you.

805
00:38:42,006 --> 00:38:45,510
- Except for cheating on you!
- There it is.

806
00:38:45,544 --> 00:38:50,481
Okay. Well, then...
back to work.

807
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:53,083
Yeah.

808
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:59,757
Listen, when you do
propose to someone,

809
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,192
that's the ring that'll do it.

810
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,961
Mm-hmm.

811
00:39:04,163 --> 00:39:05,630
Yeah.

812
00:39:10,703 --> 00:39:14,273
So as soon as you heard
they were doing opposition research,

813
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:16,141
you ran over to Tiffany
and bought the ring?

814
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:17,943
That's insane.

815
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,579
I had to send my agent or
it would have shown up in the papers.

816
00:39:20,613 --> 00:39:21,914
- <i>Will.</i>
- I'm gonna return it.

817
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:23,482
Does that seem normal to you?

818
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:25,317
The world is made up
of two kinds of people.

819
00:39:25,351 --> 00:39:28,554
The ones who think they're normal
and the ones who know there's no such thing.

820
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:31,657
Great, you took one semester
of Intro to Adult Psych.

821
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:35,428
But the world is made up of
a lot more than two kinds of people.

822
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:38,098
<i>And I was speaking in the
psychiatric sense of the word.</i>

823
00:39:38,132 --> 00:39:40,434
- <i>Does going out and buying a ring...</i>
- Which I'm going to return.

824
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:43,870
As a bizarre--
I don't know what to call it--

825
00:39:43,905 --> 00:39:45,505
seem normal to you?

826
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,307
You weren't around
for the exposition.

827
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,742
She had an affair
with her ex-boyfriend.

828
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:50,611
For four months
while she was with me.

829
00:39:50,645 --> 00:39:53,313
- It's four years later.
- And you know why I don't talk about it?

830
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:56,816
Because I'm tired of people telling me
it's a "just get over it" situation.

831
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:00,387
Fuck you.
You don't know what it's like in my head.

832
00:40:10,731 --> 00:40:12,931
Sloan Sabbith.

833
00:40:16,336 --> 00:40:19,305
<i>It's a Japanese news report
from a few hours ago.</i>

834
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:22,608
We know they're talking about you,
but we don't know what they're saying.

835
00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:30,983
"After releasing incorrect information
to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith"--

836
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:34,219
That's a picture of Elliot and he didn't
release incorrect information. I did.

837
00:40:34,254 --> 00:40:36,855
And it wasn't incorrect.

838
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:42,461
"After releasing incorrect information
to the American journalist Sloan Sabbith...

839
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:50,870
TEPCO spokesman Daisuke Tanaka
has offered to resign today.

840
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,574
He said, 'I apologize
to my company,

841
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,811
<i>my government,
and my country.'"</i>

842
00:41:04,551 --> 00:41:06,586
Please, I have to fix this now.

843
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,188
Help me.
I need wisdom.

844
00:41:09,222 --> 00:41:12,324
- I have wisdom.
- Kenzie, I love you,

845
00:41:12,358 --> 00:41:13,959
but a Japanese man's honor
is at stake,

846
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:16,829
and sometimes your wisdom
leads to...

847
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:21,334
like...

848
00:41:23,237 --> 00:41:25,506
- No, I get it.
- Yeah.

849
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,007
Will?

850
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:32,313
She'd just been suspended and
she's thinking about the other guy's job.

851
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:34,449
Honor, actually,
is what she said.

852
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:36,751
Meanwhile,
she's a punch line on the Internet.

853
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,119
- And he's got students, too.
<i>- Who?</i>

854
00:41:39,154 --> 00:41:41,556
Sloan. She teaches
at Columbia twice a week.

855
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,525
You said he.
He's got students.

856
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:47,027
And you feel that's
a breakthrough moment?

857
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:49,129
That my subconscious
revealed something?

858
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:52,599
'Cause I'll be honest. I'm pretty sure
the reason I said he instead of she

859
00:41:52,633 --> 00:41:55,202
is that I've been awake
for a really long time now.

860
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,871
But those comments
weren't on your site, right?

861
00:41:57,905 --> 00:42:00,741
No, because nobody's gonna say that
unless they're anonymous.

862
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:02,675
And if you don't count the death threat,
it worked.

863
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:05,378
It was bully kryptonite.
No more LollypopLollypop.

864
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:08,381
- What did SurrendrDorothee mean when--
- Huh?

865
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:10,583
<i>The screen name
of the person--</i>

866
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:13,286
- It's what the--
<i>- Yeah, the screen name of the person--</i>

867
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,521
- Yeah.
- On the last night you showed anonymous posts.

868
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:17,690
It's what the witch
wrote in the sky--

869
00:42:17,724 --> 00:42:19,992
<i>I'm not asking what
the screen name means.</i>

870
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:22,027
I'm asking what the person
that when he or she said

871
00:42:22,062 --> 00:42:26,132
that your guest that night had
hit the Uncle Tom Daily Double.

872
00:42:28,669 --> 00:42:31,037
The guest he or she
was talking about

873
00:42:31,072 --> 00:42:32,705
was a man named Sutton Wall,

874
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,042
<i>who was the deputy chief of staff
to Rick Santorum,</i>

875
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:37,911
<i>former senator for Pennsylvania</i>

876
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:39,379
<i>who just announced
his intention to run</i>

877
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:40,814
<i>for President
of the United States.</i>

878
00:42:40,848 --> 00:42:42,815
<i>The list of
prospective candidates</i>

879
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,617
for the Republican
nomination for president

880
00:42:44,651 --> 00:42:46,185
may yet include another name.

881
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,788
Earlier this week,
former Pennsylvania senator

882
00:42:48,823 --> 00:42:51,458
Rick Santorum convened
an exploratory committee...

883
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:54,361
And Sutton Wall
is both black and gay.

884
00:42:54,395 --> 00:42:56,997
The senator is perhaps best known
for his full-throated

885
00:42:57,031 --> 00:42:58,765
advocacy of social issues.

886
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,168
<i>Here to discuss how
those positions and others</i>

887
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:02,903
<i>may shape Mr. Santorum's
bid for the White House</i>

888
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:05,839
is his former deputy chief of staff
Sutton Wall,

889
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,942
an adjunct professor of American Studies
at Temple University,

890
00:43:08,976 --> 00:43:12,479
who will be serving as an advisor
to the campaign throughout this process.

891
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,381
He teaches at Temple?

892
00:43:14,415 --> 00:43:16,283
Yeah.

893
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:17,851
<i>So he has students?</i>

894
00:43:20,521 --> 00:43:22,455
Yes, he has students.

895
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:25,391
And LollypopLollypop
said you almost made him cry.

896
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:28,727
That-- That was absolutely
not my intention.

897
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:31,263
Well, you're hardwired
to hate bullies.

898
00:43:31,297 --> 00:43:33,565
Like the way comic book heroes

899
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,634
are born out of
a childhood trauma.

900
00:43:35,668 --> 00:43:38,637
Santorum was the bully
in that situation.

901
00:43:38,671 --> 00:43:41,407
Speaking to the
<i>New York Times</i> in May 2005,

902
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:45,645
Senator Santorum said,
"Gay marriage threatens my marriage.

903
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,013
It threatens all marriages.

904
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:49,816
It threatens the traditional
values of this country."

905
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:53,287
Mr. Wall, how does gay marriage
threaten Mr. Santorum's marriage?

906
00:43:53,321 --> 00:43:56,257
<i>The senator believes
that marriage is defined</i>

907
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,059
as the union of one man
and one woman.

908
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,860
I understand that's what
the former senator believes,

909
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,798
but what he said was that gay marriage
threatens his marriage and all marriages.

910
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,301
And I'm asking you exactly
how it's a threat.

911
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:08,604
Sanctity of life
is the number one issue

912
00:44:08,638 --> 00:44:10,706
with Rick Santorum,
and he believes--

913
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,209
Mr. Wall, we'll get to purposely vague words
like sanctity in a moment.

914
00:44:13,243 --> 00:44:15,945
But I'd like you to try
to answer the question.

915
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:19,215
How is Mr. Santorum's marriage
threatened

916
00:44:19,249 --> 00:44:21,717
by the gay couple two houses down
also being married?

917
00:44:21,752 --> 00:44:24,720
Will, I was proud to serve
on the senator's staff,

918
00:44:24,754 --> 00:44:27,890
and I'll be proud to serve and support him
should he choose to run for president.

919
00:44:27,924 --> 00:44:29,959
But that doesn't mean
I necessarily agree with him

920
00:44:29,993 --> 00:44:31,661
on every single issue.

921
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:34,330
Gay marriage is now legal
in five states

922
00:44:34,365 --> 00:44:35,966
as well as
the District of Columbia.

923
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,303
<i>Has Mr. Santorum's marriage
been suffering as a result?</i>

924
00:44:40,337 --> 00:44:43,507
<i>Has he complained to you
that he and Mrs. Santorum</i>

925
00:44:43,541 --> 00:44:45,609
seem to be fighting more
or talking less?

926
00:44:45,643 --> 00:44:48,545
- Of course not.
- Has there been any infidelity

927
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:51,748
<i>in the last seven years or
an inability to relate to their children</i>

928
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:54,284
<i>as a result of five states
legalizing same-sex marriage?</i>

929
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,219
This is a preposterous
line of questioning, sir.

930
00:44:56,254 --> 00:44:58,989
I'm afraid it has to be, sir,
because it's a preposterous assertion.

931
00:44:59,023 --> 00:45:00,790
Now, are you able
to name one way

932
00:45:00,825 --> 00:45:03,960
in which Mr. Santorum's marriage
to Mrs. Santorum

933
00:45:03,995 --> 00:45:07,231
is threatened by gay couples
also having the right to marry?

934
00:45:07,265 --> 00:45:09,366
I--

935
00:45:12,705 --> 00:45:16,607
- I am not able to name a way.
- Thank you.

936
00:45:16,642 --> 00:45:19,510
I could have just
stopped it there.

937
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,546
Does it bother you that
Mr. Santorum thinks

938
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,414
there's something wrong with you
that should be fixed?

939
00:45:23,448 --> 00:45:26,284
Hang on, because I am sick
and tired of these attacks,

940
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,620
these wrongheaded attacks against a great man
and a great public servant.

941
00:45:29,655 --> 00:45:32,023
Reasonable people can disagree
about how great a man

942
00:45:32,057 --> 00:45:34,625
or how great a public
servant Rick Santorum is,

943
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:36,761
but they can't disagree about
the fact that he thinks

944
00:45:36,795 --> 00:45:39,530
you're a sick deviant who's threatening
the fabric of society.

945
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:42,000
I have known this man
for almost a decade,

946
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:45,036
and I can tell you that he has treated me
with nothing but respect.

947
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:47,806
This is Senator Santorum
speaking to Fox News.

948
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,775
- Easy does it, Will.
- No, we're gonna do this thing.

949
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:52,544
That this is the equivalent,

950
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:56,915
that being black and being gay
is the same is simply not true.

951
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,617
There are all sorts
of studies out there

952
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:00,820
that suggest just the contrary,

953
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:04,323
<i>and there are people who were gay
and lived a gay lifestyle</i>

954
00:46:04,357 --> 00:46:07,059
and aren't anymore.
I don't know if that's the similar situation.

955
00:46:07,094 --> 00:46:09,329
I don't think that's the case
with anybody that's black.

956
00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:11,631
Mr. Santorum is forgiving you
for being black

957
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,433
<i>because there's nothing
you can do about that.</i>

958
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:15,235
But you don't <i>have</i> to be gay.

959
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:17,537
I will say it again.
Mr. Santorum is a great man

960
00:46:17,571 --> 00:46:19,206
who would make
a great president.

961
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,776
He has never treated me
with anything but the utmost respect.

962
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,511
Except for finding
you disgusting.

963
00:46:24,545 --> 00:46:26,646
- That is a lie.
- Will, don't--

964
00:46:26,681 --> 00:46:28,949
Has Rick Santorum on
the floor of the US Senate

965
00:46:28,983 --> 00:46:31,952
compared homosexuality
to incest and bestiality?

966
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:34,488
Those remarks have been taken
out of context over the years--

967
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:37,057
Feel free to put the remarks
in the proper context.

968
00:46:37,091 --> 00:46:41,294
He makes a clear distinction between
homosexuality and homosexual acts.

969
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:43,964
So he only finds you disgusting
when you act like a homosexual?

970
00:46:43,998 --> 00:46:46,099
- He doesn't find me disgusting.
- Yes, he does.

971
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:47,768
<i>And he also thinks
you're less than a man.</i>

972
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:49,436
- <i>No, he certainly does not.</i>
- Come on.

973
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,171
<i>Our Declaration
contains the words</i>

974
00:46:51,205 --> 00:46:52,805
<i>"We hold these truths
to be self-evident</i>

975
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,141
that all men are created equal."

976
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:58,044
In order to arrive at the conclusion
that homosexual love

977
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,612
is something less than
heterosexual love,

978
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,647
you have to begin
with the premise

979
00:47:01,682 --> 00:47:04,884
that a homosexual is something
less than a man. That's inescapable.

980
00:47:04,919 --> 00:47:07,821
And so I'm asking you
to explain to me

981
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:11,358
why you would work for a man
who believes that you're inferior?

982
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:14,328
- That you're damaged. That you're ill.
- Stop hitting him.

983
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:16,129
<i>Unnatural.
A threat to children.</i>

984
00:47:16,164 --> 00:47:18,098
Unfit to serve in the military.

985
00:47:18,133 --> 00:47:20,434
Unfit to be a parent.
And unloved by God.

986
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:22,803
- I'm asking you, sir--
- Stop! Just stop!

987
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:26,341
I believe in the sanctity of life.

988
00:47:26,375 --> 00:47:28,476
And if that word is too vague for you,
then look it up.

989
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,746
<i>I support the senator because
of all the candidates in the field,</i>

990
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:34,416
I believe he is
the only one whose passion

991
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,818
on the issue of abortion
equals my own.

992
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:40,222
And I believe he has the skills
to make a fantastic president.

993
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,490
I am not talking--
That's not--

994
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,760
You will not interrupt
me again, sir!

995
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:47,796
I am more than one thing.

996
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:52,135
<i>How dare you reduce me
to the color of my skin</i>

997
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,203
or my sexual orientation?

998
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:57,306
There are people
who look just like me,

999
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,541
thousands and thousands
who died for the freedom

1000
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,777
to define their own lives
for themselves.

1001
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:05,714
How dare you presume to decide
what I should think is important?

1002
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,919
Yes, when it comes to equality
for the gay community,

1003
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:11,787
Senator Santorum is wrong.

1004
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,757
But I am far more insulted
by your high-handed implication

1005
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,260
- <i>that I need your protection.</i>
- Sir, I--

1006
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,096
Shut up!
I'll let you know when I'm finished.

1007
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,070
<i>I came on this program
because Rick Santorum</i>

1008
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,774
<i>believes that the right
to kill an unborn child</i>

1009
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:32,876
is not inalienable.

1010
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,412
And I stand with Rick Santorum.

1011
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,281
And I stand with
the Catholic Church.

1012
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,820
<i>I am not defined by
my blackness.</i>

1013
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,790
I am not defined by my gayness.

1014
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:50,193
And if that doesn't fit
your narrow-minded expectation

1015
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:52,629
of who I'm supposed to be,
I don't give a damn

1016
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:54,831
because I'm not defined
by you either.

1017
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:59,235
<i>So get this through your head.</i>

1018
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:04,274
I don't need your help.

1019
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:08,879
Mr. Wall?

1020
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,722
Does Mr. Santorum
think you're fit to be a teacher?

1021
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:26,397
No.

1022
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,601
We'll be back after this.

1023
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,145
He has students.

1024
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,514
And parents.

1025
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:44,750
And friends.

1026
00:49:44,785 --> 00:49:46,652
And colleagues.
And strangers.

1027
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,088
I was the bully.

1028
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:55,160
I was the bully.

1029
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:57,629
Mm-hmm.

1030
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:03,668
You've got to give me credit for uniting
the far right, the gay community,

1031
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:05,869
and blacks
in their dislike of me.

1032
00:50:05,904 --> 00:50:07,371
The Internet exploded.

1033
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,406
Everybody thought
I'd become unhinged.

1034
00:50:09,441 --> 00:50:11,175
It sort of brought
back this thing

1035
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,143
that happened about
a year ago at Northwestern.

1036
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:16,113
When you yelled at a student.

1037
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,316
I scared her.

1038
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,926
All right.

1039
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,801
All right.

1040
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:41,338
That's <i>News Night</i>.
Thanks for washing us-- Watching us.

1041
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,440
- Let me get out of here.
- End the broadcast.

1042
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:46,242
- I'm Will McAvoy.
- Attaboy.

1043
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:49,679
Terry Smith is coming up, mercifully,
with the <i>Capitol Report</i> from Washington.

1044
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,915
Good night.

1045
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,787
If you're here to make me feel better,
it's not necessary.

1046
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,556
You think I'm here
to make you feel better?

1047
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:02,858
The story is right.
In this one case,

1048
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,160
I don't give a damn about on the record,
off the record.

1049
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,463
- And no one in Fukushima does either.
- I do.

1050
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:09,365
The story is right.

1051
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,934
- His spokesman denied it on the air.
- He said it to me.

1052
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,337
And you got proof of that
I can bounce off our satellite?

1053
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,839
- No.
- Is Maggie into Jim?

1054
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:18,408
For Christ's sake,
we're talking about radia-- What?

1055
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,747
Am I losing Maggie?

1056
00:51:24,615 --> 00:51:26,683
No.

1057
00:51:33,224 --> 00:51:35,425
Are you good
at knowing these things?

1058
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,529
No.

1059
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:45,468
Make sure he's at Dr. Habib's office
at 10:00 tomorrow.

1060
00:51:45,503 --> 00:51:47,237
When are you and me
gonna get busy, huh?

1061
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,105
I'm flattered,
but you'd crush me.

1062
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,773
That's true.
That's happened before.

1063
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:53,843
Dress up like a tailback and he
won't be able to lay a hand on you.

1064
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:56,213
Shrimp boat, if I wasn't
being paid to keep you alive...

1065
00:51:56,247 --> 00:51:57,948
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- Hey, girl!

1066
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:00,984
Do you really have
to call her that?

1067
00:52:01,019 --> 00:52:02,419
She's packing up her office.

1068
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,588
She's gonna unpack her office
'cause I figured a way out.

1069
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:06,223
What?

1070
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:09,459
The Japanese words
for four and seven sound alike.

1071
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:14,064
- Hey, girl!
- Yes?

1072
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:16,266
Come on down.

1073
00:52:25,008 --> 00:52:26,976
I am here.

1074
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,144
What's the Japanese
word for four?

1075
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:30,579
<i>Shi.</i>

1076
00:52:30,613 --> 00:52:32,681
What's the Japanese
word for seven?

1077
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,017
- <i>Shichi.</i>
- Those words are easy to mix up.

1078
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,852
- <i>No, they're not.</i>
- Yes, they are.

1079
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,320
Not for someone
who's fluent in Japanese.

1080
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,523
- You're not fluent in Japanese.
- Yes, I am.

1081
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,458
No, you're not.
That's how you mixed up the numbers

1082
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,693
when you were talking to
Tanaka in the preinterview.

1083
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,228
<i>No, it's for exactly
that reason</i>

1084
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,164
that there are two words for four
and two words for seven.

1085
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,934
<i>Yon</i> and <i>nana.</i>
And it went from a four to a five to a seven.

1086
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,603
That sounds very complicated.

1087
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,171
Not if you're fluent
in Japanese.

1088
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,605
You're not anymore.

1089
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,940
You're gonna go on TV tonight

1090
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,709
during Elliot's show,

1091
00:53:00,743 --> 00:53:02,844
which I pray to God
Elliot is hosting.

1092
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:06,447
- He is.
- And you're going to apologize and explain your error.

1093
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:09,950
In exchange,
Daisuke Tanaka is going to say

1094
00:53:09,984 --> 00:53:12,452
that you made it clear
that you were on the record

1095
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:15,588
and he doesn't have to resign
and you don't have to be suspended.

1096
00:53:15,623 --> 00:53:17,924
We're all just going to lie
and I'm going to look stupid.

1097
00:53:17,958 --> 00:53:20,426
- You bet. One more thing.
- What?

1098
00:53:20,461 --> 00:53:23,696
Fukushima's announcing
the radiation levels are a seven.

1099
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:25,398
Thank you.

1100
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:27,299
I don't know what the hell
you're thanking me for.

1101
00:53:27,334 --> 00:53:29,935
Well, it takes a big man
to admit he was wrong.

1102
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:32,505
That isn't even remotely
what I am doing.

1103
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:35,675
Hang on, she's got to go on the air
and say she made a mistake,

1104
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,143
that her Japanese is poor--

1105
00:53:37,177 --> 00:53:39,945
- Which it certainly is not.
- Just-- God.

1106
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,748
She's gonna go on the air
and say she thought it was a seven

1107
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,684
when it's really a four
that then moved up to a five

1108
00:53:44,718 --> 00:53:47,386
and she's really sorry,
but also now it's really a seven?

1109
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,456
It won't be our proudest moment,
but it'll save the guy's job.

1110
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:53,291
Save his honor.

1111
00:53:53,325 --> 00:53:57,896
Help very slightly with our increasingly
dinged-up reputation,

1112
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,632
and it'll help the girl
who we will now go back

1113
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:04,036
to addressing as Sloan
or Miss Sabbith.

1114
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:06,138
Will.

1115
00:54:09,843 --> 00:54:11,778
You want me to lie?

1116
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:13,146
On television?

1117
00:54:13,181 --> 00:54:16,883
From a news desk
with the ACN bug in the corner?

1118
00:54:22,156 --> 00:54:23,890
I do.

1119
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:26,526
And if there's any fallout,

1120
00:54:26,561 --> 00:54:28,695
I'll be standing
right next to you and in front.

1121
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:32,065
I'll always be standing
right next to you and in front.

1122
00:54:36,538 --> 00:54:38,539
We fucked up.

1123
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:41,576
Let's just live with that now.

1124
00:54:56,927 --> 00:55:00,096
<i>We lied on television
from the news desk.</i>

1125
00:55:00,131 --> 00:55:02,165
<i>It was a pretty harmless lie,
wasn't it?</i>

1126
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,701
You know how many air hours
I've spent railing against lying?

1127
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,569
Calling people out on it?

1128
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:10,674
We're the news and we're all gonna know
we lied for the rest of our lives.

1129
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:14,344
All right, so it turns out
you know what you're doing.

1130
00:55:14,378 --> 00:55:16,079
So I'm sorry I've been a jerk.

1131
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:19,215
Obviously the reason I can't sleep
is the Santorum aide.

1132
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:21,617
And I haven't talked to anyone about it,
so I was trying--

1133
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,385
- Bacon.
- What?

1134
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,688
The bacon, egg,
and cheese sandwiches.

1135
00:55:25,722 --> 00:55:29,191
Bacon has tyramine, which increases
the release of norepinephrine,

1136
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:32,294
- which is a neurostimulant.
- When did you figure that out?

1137
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,896
When you said you made bacon,
egg, and cheese sandwiches.

1138
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,231
- That was like an hour ago!
- Yeah.

1139
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:40,435
Will, listen, and I'm going to write
you a mild prescription,

1140
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,537
but you should come back.

1141
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:45,807
If you don't like me,
see someone else.

1142
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:49,177
But see someone.
You've had a lot going on for a long time.

1143
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,878
Very serious stuff.
And, by the way,

1144
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:54,816
you should be at an Al-Anon meeting
at least once a week.

1145
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:57,052
You have a lot going on now.

1146
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,254
You're being hunted.

1147
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:01,623
<i>In the press,</i>

1148
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:04,759
<i>on the Internet,</i>

1149
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:08,163
<i>very possibly literally.</i>

1150
00:56:08,197 --> 00:56:10,332
This whole file here
from four years ago,

1151
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,134
every page is about Mackenzie.

1152
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:14,069
In these notes
are a lot of evidence

1153
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,739
that you're experiencing
acute depression

1154
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,775
and doing a masterful job
covering it.

1155
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,309
That's done.

1156
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,347
<i>Buying the ring
was not normal.</i>

1157
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,484
<i>I don't know what else to call it.
It wasn't normal.</i>

1158
00:56:31,322 --> 00:56:34,791
<i>It really doesn't take a team
of Viennese specialists</i>

1159
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:37,160
<i>to see that you have unresolved issues
with Mackenzie.</i>

1160
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:39,929
<i>No, my feelings
are completely resolved.</i>

1161
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:42,465
She's a good friend
and my most trusted partner.

1162
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,200
The ring was just a prank.

1163
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:53,141
<i>I know what you think
of all this.</i>

1164
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,945
But I would really urge you

1165
00:56:56,979 --> 00:57:00,549
to spend an hour a week
faking it.

1166
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:05,388
That's it.
Our time's up.
