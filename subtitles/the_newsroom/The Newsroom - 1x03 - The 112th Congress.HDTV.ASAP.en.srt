1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,068
Will never cheated on me.

2
00:00:01,092 --> 00:00:02,533
- Who told you that?
- Everybody.

3
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:03,915
<i>I'm sending him an e-mail.</i>

4
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,932
What just happened?

5
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:07,809
- I got a staff e-mail from you.
<i>- Me too.</i>

6
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:09,612
I want everyone to delete the
e-mail without reading it.

7
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:10,781
Why is this happening?!

8
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:13,492
I didn't know that I was
in love with you until--

9
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:15,063
You cheated on me
with your ex-boyfriend.

10
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,597
Go to the conservative
websites.

11
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:18,633
They like that you don't take
cheap shots at Sarah Palin.

12
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,838
I can't jam in a Palin SOT
just to give myself

13
00:00:20,872 --> 00:00:22,774
the opportunity to not
take a shot at her.

14
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,209
Mackenzie would cook me
and eat me.

15
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:25,682
How did Palin
get into the rundown?

16
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:27,521
- I don't need your permission--
- Yes, you do.

17
00:00:27,555 --> 00:00:29,291
You didn't ask for it 'cause you
knew you wouldn't get it.

18
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:31,394
I want to know.
Are you in or are you out?

19
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,762
- Let's break-up.
- What did I do now.

20
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:35,501
- You were too supportive.
- We break-up, I apologize,

21
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,103
- everything's fine.
- Sounds like a super healthy relationship.

22
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,206
- I would fight for it.
- I will fight for it.

23
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,911
- You still gonna worry about the ratings?
- I'm in.

24
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:45,047
- What?
- I'm in.

00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:58,454
I welcome these hearings
because of the opportunity

37
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:00,622
that they provide
to the American people

38
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:04,559
to better understand why
the tragedy of 9/11 happened

39
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:08,396
<i>and what we must do
to prevent a reoccurrence.</i>

40
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,300
I also welcome the hearings
because it is finally a forum

41
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:15,369
where I can apologize

42

<i>to the loved ones
of the victims of 9/11.</i>

43
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:22,877
To them who are here
in the room,

44
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,912
to those who are
watching on television,

45
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:28,850
<i>your government failed you.</i>

46
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:31,886
Those entrusted
with protecting you

47
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,022
failed you.

48
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,291
And I failed you.

49
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,660
Good evening.
I'm Will McAvoy.

50
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,428
This is <i>News Night</i>,
and that was a clip

51
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:42,963
of Richard Clarke,
former counterterrorism chief

52
00:03:42,998 --> 00:03:44,365
to President George W. Bush,

53
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:48,636
<i>testifying before Congress
on March 24, 2004.</i>

54
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,705
Americans liked that moment.

55
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,573
I liked that moment.

56
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,043
Adults should hold themselves
accountable for failure.

57
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,813
And so tonight I'm beginning
this newscast

58
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,948
by joining Mr. Clarke
in apologizing

59
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:03,117
to the American people
for our failure.

60
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:06,787
The failure of this program during
the time I've been in charge of it

61
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:10,424
to successfully inform and educate
the American electorate.

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,727
<i>Let me be clear
that I don't apologize</i>

63
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:15,796
<i>on behalf of all
broadcast journalists,</i>

64
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,100
<i>nor do all broadcast
journalists owe an apology.</i>

65
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,235
<i>I speak for myself.</i>

66
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,704
<i>I was an accomplice to a slow
and repeated and unacknowledged</i>

67
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,206
<i>and unamended train wreck
of failures</i>

68
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,975
<i>that have brought us to now.</i>

69
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,378
I'm a leader in an industry
that miscalled election results,

70
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,314
hyped up terror scares,
ginned up controversy,

71
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:38,517
and failed to report on tectonic
shifts in our country.

72
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,852
<i>From the collapse of
the financial system</i>

73
00:04:40,886 --> 00:04:42,587
<i>to the truths
about how strong we are</i>

74
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,189
<i>to the dangers
we actually face.</i>

75
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:47,759
<i>I'm a leader in an industry
that misdirected</i>

76
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:50,628
<i>your attention with
the dexterity of Harry Houdini</i>

77
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:54,764
<i>while sending hundreds of thousands
of our bravest young men and women</i>

78
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:58,000
<i>off to war without
due diligence.</i>

79
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:00,002
The reason we failed
isn't a mystery.

80
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,537
We took a dive for the ratings.

81
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:05,206
<i>In the infancy
of mass communications,</i>

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,241
the Columbus and Magellan
of broadcast journalism,

83
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,109
William Paley
and David Sarnoff,

84
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,878
went down to Washington
to cut a deal with Congress.

85
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,213
<i>Congress would allow
the fledgling networks</i>

86
00:05:14,248 --> 00:05:16,716
<i>free use of taxpayer-owned
airwaves</i>

87
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,052
<i>in exchange for one
public service.</i>

88
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:22,155
<i>That public service would
be one hour of air time</i>

89
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,225
<i>set aside every night
for informational broadcasting,</i>

90
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,461
or what we now call
the evening news.

91
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,231
Congress, unable to anticipate
the enormous capacity

92
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:34,568
television would have to deliver
consumers to advertisers,

93
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:37,671
<i>failed to include in its deal
the one requirement</i>

94
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,773
that would have changed
our national discourse

95
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:41,408
immeasurably for the better.

96
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:44,611
Congress forgot to add
that under no circumstances

97
00:05:44,646 --> 00:05:46,547
could there be paid advertising

98
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:48,649
during informational
broadcasting.

99
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:53,120
<i>They forgot to say that taxpayers
will give you the airwaves for free</i>

100
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,789
<i>and for 23 hours a day
you should make a profit,</i>

101
00:05:55,824 --> 00:05:58,726
but for one hour a night
you work for us.

102
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,161
<i>And now those
network newscasts,</i>

103
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,098
<i>anchored through history
by honest-to-God newsmen</i>

104
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,101
<i>with names like Murrow
and Reasoner and Huntley</i>

105
00:06:07,135 --> 00:06:10,471
<i>and Brinkley and Buckley
and Cronkite and Rather</i>

106
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:14,041
<i>and Russert-- Now they have to
compete with the likes of me.</i>

107
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:17,377
A cable anchor who's
in the exact same business

108
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,046
as the producers
of <i>Jersey Shore</i>.

109
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:21,849
<i>And that business
was good to us,</i>

110
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:24,485
<i>but </i>News Night<i> is quitting
that business right now.</i>

111
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,754
<i>It might come
as a surprise to you</i>

112
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,890
<i>that some of history's greatest
American journalists are working right now,</i>

113
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,393
<i>exceptional minds
with years of experience</i>

114
00:06:32,427 --> 00:06:35,229
<i>and an unshakeable devotion
to reporting the news.</i>

115
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,999
But these voices
are a small minority now

116
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,168
and they don't stand a chance
against the circus

117
00:06:40,203 --> 00:06:43,639
when the circus comes to town.
They're overmatched.

118
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:46,743
I'm quitting the circus
and switching teams.

119
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:49,679
I'm going with the guys
who are getting creamed.

120
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:52,249
I'm moved that they still
think they can win

121
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:54,451
and I hope they can teach
me a thing or two.

122
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:57,555
<i>From this moment on, we'll be
deciding what goes on our air</i>

123
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,225
and how it's presented to you
based on the simple truth

124
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:02,594
that nothing is more
important to a democracy

125
00:07:02,628 --> 00:07:04,095
than a well-informed
electorate.

126
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,332
<i>We'll endeavor to put information
in a broader context</i>

127
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,534
<i>because we know that very
little news is born</i>

128
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:11,937
<i>at the moment
it comes across our wire.</i>

129
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,739
<i>We'll be the champion of facts</i>

130
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:17,042
<i>and the mortal enemy
of innuendo, speculation,</i>

131
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:19,112
<i>hyperbole, and nonsense.</i>

132
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,847
<i>We're not waiters
in a restaurant</i>

133
00:07:20,882 --> 00:07:24,384
<i>serving you the stories you asked for
just the way you like them prepared.</i>

134
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:27,220
Nor are we computers
dispensing only the facts

135
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:30,923
because news is only useful in
the context of humanity.

136
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:33,826
I'll make no effort to subdue
my personal opinions.

137
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,861
I will make every effort
to expose you

138
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,331
to informed opinions that
are different from my own.

139
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:41,901
You may ask who are we
to make these decisions.

140
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:45,672
We are Mackenzie McHale
and myself.

141
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,408
<i>Miss McHale
is our executive producer.</i>

142
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:51,078
<i>She marshals the resources
of over 100 reporters,</i>

143
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:52,713
<i>producers,
analysts, technicians,</i>

144
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:55,649
and her credentials
are readily available.

145
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,718
I'm <i>News Night's</i>
managing editor

146
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,820
and make the final decision
on everything seen

147
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,254
and heard on this program.

148
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,124
Who are we to make
these decisions?

149
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,593
We're the media elite.

150
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,965
We'll be back after this
with the news.

151
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,334
It would be accurate
to say it started

152
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,869
with his on-air apology.

153
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:17,571
Pardon, it would be accurate
to say what started?

154
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:19,573
<i>Was he aware that he
went on television</i>

155
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,275
and said everything
his network had done

156
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:22,910
up until that point was trash?

157
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,447
I think he was fully aware
of what he said

158
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:27,449
and that he was on
television when he said it.

159
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:29,218
He also took
responsibility for himself

160
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:31,253
and not the network
or the company.

161
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:33,456
What are we talking about?

162
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,128
Mmm, hey.

163
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,464
You're working late.

164
00:08:40,498 --> 00:08:43,767
Well, it was either
this or go home.

165
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:46,103
- So...
<i>- Listen, I was at a bar.</i>

166
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:48,405
I saw the show tonight
at a bar.

167
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,307
And I may have been overserved.

168
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,576
I'm fine, I'm just--
If I say anything...

169
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:54,512
You want to sit down?

170
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:56,814
Ahem.

171
00:08:56,848 --> 00:09:00,184
How much did you have to do with
writing that opening tonight?

172
00:09:00,218 --> 00:09:02,453
Uh...

173
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:04,755
It was something
Will wanted to do.

174
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,259
- He passed it around.
- I'd have loved to have been part of that.

175
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,296
I could have done the show
you guys want to do.

176
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:14,831
I'm equipped for that.

177
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:17,100
God, Don, that's--

178
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:20,403
You can.
You can.

179
00:09:20,438 --> 00:09:23,940
You guys can follow up.
You can expand, you can rebut.

180
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,777
I've got a mandate.

181
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:29,246
Bring viewers to 10:00.

182
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,651
I don't, and they'll try someone
else until someone does.

183
00:09:33,685 --> 00:09:37,321
I have to cover
Natalee Holloway.

184
00:09:37,355 --> 00:09:39,690
And you guys just set me up
to look like an asshole

185
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,158
before I even got a chance
to get started.

186
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,827
- That wasn't--
- Oh, no, shut up.

187
00:09:46,431 --> 00:09:48,666
That wasn't our intent.

188
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,968
And you can insist--

189
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:53,838
You can insist on--

190
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:02,746
That's what you were reading
on your BlackBerry, right?

191
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:04,381
Yeah.

192
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,618
I mean, it said
"eyes only," baby.

193
00:10:09,254 --> 00:10:11,322
I've got eyes.

194
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:16,827
The apology was a Monday.
The following Saturday

195
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,662
was the Times Square bomb.

196
00:10:18,697 --> 00:10:20,431
By Tuesday we had
all the facts.

197
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,133
This is the kind
of story that makes people

198
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:24,668
want to turn on the news,
so you want to take advantage of it.

199
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,937
- That's News 101, right?
- What is this meeting?

200
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,140
- Is it News 101?
- To artificially hype the threat of a bomb?

201
00:10:30,174 --> 00:10:32,575
You're confusing it
with Douchebaggery 101.

202
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,711
- And the Muslim?
- That was a borderline call,

203
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:36,779
but they're qualified
to make borderline calls.

204
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:39,248
- What is this meeting about?
<i>- Keep going.</i>

205
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:43,085
By comparison, CBS had Katie
open her show from Times Square

206
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,687
<i>while </i>News Night<i> gave it
three minutes and 20 seconds.</i>

207
00:10:45,721 --> 00:10:47,322
<i>Basically said there was
nothing to worry about</i>

208
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:49,291
<i>and, as you said,
mentioned that one of the people</i>

209
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,826
<i>who notified the police
was a Muslim.</i>

210
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,694
<i>That's called
squandering an opportunity.</i>

211
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:55,864
<i>These are the important facts.
First, it was a lone wolf.</i>

212
00:10:55,898 --> 00:10:59,167
Shahzad was trained in Pakistan,
but he wasn't connected to a terror network.

213
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,903
Second, the situation was
handled by first responders

214
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,538
in law enforcement,
not an army.

215
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:05,006
<i>And finally, the system worked.</i>

216
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,708
<i>He was taken off
the plane by a final check</i>

217
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:09,011
of the flight manifest
by a US Customs officer.

218
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:11,780
What about the fact he was
allowed on the plane in the first place

219
00:11:11,814 --> 00:11:14,148
10 hours after the feds
put him on a no-fly list?

220
00:11:14,183 --> 00:11:15,716
The airline hadn't updated
its files yet,

221
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,619
which is why Customs and Border Protection
does a second check.

222
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,887
- That's the system working.
- Three minutes at the top.

223
00:11:20,922 --> 00:11:23,090
- Will?
- Agree.

224
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:26,427
You understand we're making a conscious
choice now to do the boring version of the story?

225
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:28,529
- That's not how I'd put it, but--
- Great.

226
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,232
- Mac, there's one more thing.
- Yeah?

227
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:33,568
<i>Everyone's reporting that
it was a t-shirt vendor</i>

228
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:37,072
named Lance Orton who spotted
the smoking car and called 9-1-1.

229
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:40,142
- It was.
- I know, but it turns out Lance Orton

230
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:43,712
was alerted to the smoking car by
a photograph vendor named Aliou Niasse,

231
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,181
- an immigrant from Senegal.
- Why haven't we heard about this guy?

232
00:11:46,216 --> 00:11:48,617
Two possible reasons.
One is that he didn't make the call.

233
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:50,919
He said...

234
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:54,189
"I thought I should call 9-1-1,
but my English is not very good

235
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:55,924
and I had no credit
left on my phone.

236
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,828
So I walked over to Lance who has
a t-shirt stall next to mine and told him."

237
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:01,063
What's the second possible reason
we haven't heard about him?

238
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,232
- He's a Muslim.
- How'd you get this?

239
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,534
A Pakistani blog.

240
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,570
It's not the world's
most reliable source.

241
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,573
I know, so I confirmed it
with the NYPD, and it's true.

242
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,741
And the <i>Times of London</i>
has it online.

243
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,610
<i>And I think if the religion
of the bomber is important,</i>

244
00:12:14,644 --> 00:12:18,047
then so's the religion of the guy
who saved everyone's life.

245
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:28,156
- So do I.
<i>- All right.</i>

246
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,324
<i>3:20 at the top.</i>

247
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,992
How many viewers
did he lose that night?

248
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,627
Well, we all know he made
enemies that night

249
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:35,396
out of Fox
and right-wing radio.

250
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,631
- <i>A lot of negative press.</i>
- How many viewers did he lose?

251
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,467
- <i>People want the most up-to-date information.</i> 
<i>- They were getting it.</i>

252
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:43,504
<i>Didn't feel like it when everyone else
was saying it's a genuine threat--</i>

253
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:45,172
It didn't <i>feel</i> like it?

254
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:47,074
- How many?
<i>- 7%.</i>

255
00:12:47,108 --> 00:12:49,643
<i>He gave back the gains
he made after Northwestern.</i>

256
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,680
And that's the kind of thing that would
ordinarily scare Will straight.

257
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:54,949
But it didn't.

258
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,718
Media Matters think progress.

259
00:12:56,752 --> 00:13:00,588
Howard Kurtz and the
<i>Columbia Journalism Review</i>

260
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,458
all praised our coverage
of the Times Square bomb.

261
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,427
Do any of them advertise
on our network?

262
00:13:05,462 --> 00:13:07,162
I don't believe
they advertise anywhere.

263
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:09,632
<i>And by any chance
was it around this time</i>

264
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:14,003
that Will had some kind of
epiphany about the Tea Party?

265
00:13:14,038 --> 00:13:15,939
The Tea Party isn't
what it started out to be.

266
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,073
Have you slept?

267
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,175
I got up at 2:00 AM
and broke down polling data

268
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,611
from the Republican Senate
primary race in Utah.

269
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,613
I never heard
anyone say that before.

270
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:25,648
Someone faxed me the polling data.
I don't even know who.

271
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:28,351
But that doesn't matter. Bob Bennett,
the most conservative member

272
00:13:28,385 --> 00:13:31,587
of the Senate, is going to lose his
primary race to a guy named Mike Lee

273
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,623
'cause Lee found room
to the right of Bennett.

274
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,357
You wouldn't think
that was possible.

275
00:13:35,392 --> 00:13:38,494
Back in 1968 when Rennie Davis
and Hayden and their guys

276
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,930
organized the SDS, it was specifically
to end the Vietnam War.

277
00:13:41,964 --> 00:13:43,832
But that movement
got eaten by Abbie Hoffman

278
00:13:43,867 --> 00:13:45,334
and Jerry Rubin
and the Yippies.

279
00:13:45,368 --> 00:13:47,669
Hoffman and Rubin
were a lot more charismatic.

280
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:50,538
Yeah, but it was impossible to define
what the Yippies were protesting.

281
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,640
They were about giving
the finger to anyone over 30,

282
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:54,775
generically hating
the American establishment,

283
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,577
- dropping out, and getting high.
- And?

284
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,546
That's how
the progressive movement

285
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,181
would be painted
for the next 40 years.

286
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,982
People passing out
daisies to soldiers

287
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:03,684
and trying to levitate
the Pentagon.

288
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,919
- I was there. That damn near worked.
- No, it didn't.

289
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,121
The Pentagon's a really big building.
You can't levitate it.

290
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,990
How is there room to
the right of Bob Bennett?

291
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:12,793
For starters, a centerpiece of
Mike Lee's stump speech

292
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,695
is repealing
the 14th Amendment.

293
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:17,898
It's an applause line, and he's going to
win his primary by double digits.

294
00:14:17,932 --> 00:14:22,235
Charlie, I understood
the Tea Party in the beginning,

295
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,937
just like I understood the SDS.

296
00:14:23,971 --> 00:14:25,906
The Tea Party was
a middle-class movement

297
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,542
responding spontaneously
to bad trends.

298
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,711
Wages were stagnant,
jobs were disappearing,

299
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,480
Wall Street got trillions,
and everybody was laughing at them.

300
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,818
- But?
- They've been co-opted by the radical right,

301
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:39,921
which in turn has enslaved
the Republican middle.

302
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:43,558
So you think the '60s radicals and
the Tea Party are roughly the same?

303
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:44,960
With one big exception.

304
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,795
Even at the height of 1968,

305
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:49,364
the Democrats wouldn't have
nominated Abbie Hoffman

306
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,966
or Jerry Rubin for any office

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,569
and no candidate would have
sought their endorsement.

308
00:14:53,603 --> 00:14:56,371
Can you imagine Humphrey
or Kennedy

309
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:59,775
standing for a photo op with Bernardine Dohrn
or Allen Ginsberg?

310
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,477
- Get there.
- Oh!

311
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:04,080
- I didn't even know you were here.
- Get there.

312
00:15:04,114 --> 00:15:06,849
The Tea Party is being radicalized

313
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:09,886
and their original
organizing principles obliterated.

314
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,655
And no one should be
laughing anymore.

315
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:13,223
They should be scared shitless.

316
00:15:13,258 --> 00:15:16,393
My party's being hijacked and it's
happening in real time.

317
00:15:16,428 --> 00:15:19,196
How is this not our
top story every night?

318
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:21,899
- Thank you.
- Seriously, how did you get there?

319
00:15:21,934 --> 00:15:24,468
You're not gonna be
very popular with Republicans.

320
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:26,137
Hoffman and Rubin
weren't Democrats.

321
00:15:26,171 --> 00:15:27,638
And these guys
aren't Republicans.

322
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,240
It needs to be
a Republican saying it.

323
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,510
Top story every night till the plant from
<i>Little Shop of Horrors</i>

324
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:35,046
goes back to its planet.

325
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:38,984
I think you've got
the boy coming around.

326
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:42,020
You're the one who faxed him
the Utah polling data, right?

327
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,101
In four, three, two--
rolling.

328
00:15:57,136 --> 00:16:00,572
Your candidate Mike Lee is a
fierce supporter of the Constitution.

329
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:02,640
That's why he's our candidate.

330
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,476
Should he win
in the general election,

331
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,446
which seems likely since Utah hasn't
sent a Democrat to the Senate in 40 years,

332
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,783
he'll have to swear an oath to protect
and defend the Constitution.

333
00:16:11,817 --> 00:16:14,252
And I'm looking forward
to being there when he does.

334
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:17,155
He's also signed a note
to Grover Norquist not to raise taxes.

335
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,990
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Which oath is he bound by?

336
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,725
He'll be bound by both.

337
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,627
- Is that possible?
- Of course it is.

338
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:25,296
And that's how we're going to
rein in government spending.

339
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:28,600
Do you think part of a senator's job
should include listening to experts,

340
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:31,303
considering new information,
hearing dissenting opinions,

341
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:34,339
- and then casting his best vote?
- I sure do.

342
00:16:34,374 --> 00:16:37,676
If 10 Nobel Prize-winning economists
were to walk into his office

343
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,080
and say, "This is a national emergency
and we need to increase revenue

344
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:44,349
by asking for a small sacrifice from
the wealthiest 1% of us,"

345
00:16:44,384 --> 00:16:45,917
Mike Lee wouldn't
even discuss it?

346
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:49,287
<i>Based on his zero years
of experience in economics</i>

347
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:52,723
and tax policy, he's taken an oath
not to learn anything new

348
00:16:52,757 --> 00:16:54,625
while a member
of the US Senate?

349
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:56,827
When you blur the distinction

350
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,463
between public and private,
there are problems.

351
00:16:59,497 --> 00:17:02,665
Same thing when you blur the distinction
between answers and nonsense.

352
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,734
Does a private
restaurant in Kentucky

353
00:17:04,768 --> 00:17:06,702
have the right to deny
service to black people?

354
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,604
What it gets into is this--

355
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,273
If you decide that restaurants
are publically owed--

356
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:13,042
Restaurants
are privately owned,

357
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:15,411
and it was a yes or no question
that should be easy to answer.

358
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:17,346
Does Rand Paul believe
that a private business

359
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:20,550
should be allowed to discriminate
on the basis of race?

360
00:17:20,584 --> 00:17:22,352
Sharron Angle's angry
because the press

361
00:17:22,386 --> 00:17:24,921
is reporting what
she says to the press.

362
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:26,923
The statement goes on.

363
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,159
"We needed to have
the press be our friend.

364
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:32,696
We wanted them to ask the questions
we want to answer."

365
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:35,966
Do not laugh. I felt the exact
same way about the bar exam.

366
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,737
Whoa, Will just made a joke.

367
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,639
<i>When did that newsroom
become a courtroom?</i>

368
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:43,407
<i>I was going to say
the same thing.</i>

369
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,877
- He was a prosecutor.
- I'm sorry?

370
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:49,514
Before he was an anchor,
before he was a reporter,

371
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:52,317
before he was a speechwriter,
he was a prosecutor.

372
00:17:52,352 --> 00:17:56,122
<i>He graduated college at 19,
law school at 21,</i>

373
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:58,791
and had signed up with the Brooklyn
District Attorney's Office

374
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:02,062
where he racked up
a 94% conviction record.

375
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,831
The newsroom turned into
a courtroom, Reese,

376
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:09,069
because I made the decision that
American voters need a fucking lawyer.

377
00:18:09,104 --> 00:18:11,205
<i>"You know,
our Founding Fathers,</i>

378
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:13,707
they put that Second Amendment
in there for a good reason,

379
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:16,010
and that was for the people
to protect themselves

380
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:18,079
against a tyrannical
government.

381
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:20,481
<i>I hope that's not where
we're going, but, you know,</i>

382
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,483
if this Congress keeps
going the way it is,

383
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,587
people are really looking towards
those Second Amendment remedies."

384
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,023
Syntax problems
notwithstanding,

385
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,026
that was a Republican nominee
for the US Senate

386
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,829
saying she hasn't ruled out a
violent overthrow of her government.

387
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,499
<i>Terry Smith is up next
with the </i>Capital Report<i>.</i>

388
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

389
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:43,503
<i>And we're clear.</i>

390
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,475
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

391
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,243
You're dressed much
too nicely to work here.

392
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,312
No, I'm meeting Will.
We're going out.

393
00:18:52,346 --> 00:18:55,582
- You're going out?
- Yeah.

394
00:18:55,616 --> 00:18:58,818
Are you a relative of Will's?
Are you related?

395
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,721
No. No,
we're going on a date.

396
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,492
That's fantastic!

397
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:07,727
I don't know why
I said that so loud.

398
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,697
Um, h-how do you
guys know each--

399
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,165
- How did you meet?
- Mac, I think--

400
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,967
- Not now.
- Okay.

401
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,870
- How do you know Will?
- I work for the Jets and Will's a big fan.

402
00:19:16,904 --> 00:19:18,438
- The New York Jets?
- Yeah.

403
00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:21,374
- We met in the owner's...
- That's sensational.

404
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,077
- ...suite.
- What do you do for the Jets?

405
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,379
- I'm head of the Flight Crew.
- You're a pilot?

406
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:29,582
I'm head of the cheerleading squad.
We're called the Flight Crew.

407
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:31,884
- You're a cheerleader.
- And choreographer.

408
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,854
- It pays for graduate school.
- Hey, Danielle.

409
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,690
- Hey, dude. That was awesome.
- No.

410
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:41,361
I was sitting watching you right there
while you were right there.

411
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:43,797
You want to hear something
that will blow your mind?

412
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,366
In about three hours,
he'll be on TV on the West Coast

413
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,835
while at the same time
out with you on a date.

414
00:19:48,869 --> 00:19:52,005
Unless he gets tired, which happens
sometimes because he's old.

415
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,307
This is Mackenzie McHale.
She's my secretary.

416
00:19:54,342 --> 00:19:56,276
Multiple Peabody-winning
executive producer.

417
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,212
- I'm Danielle.
- That's a beautiful name!

418
00:19:59,246 --> 00:20:01,147
- Why are you shouting?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

419
00:20:01,182 --> 00:20:03,116
Just give me a minute to change.
We'll be out of here.

420
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:09,322
You're going on a date
with a cheerleader?

421
00:20:09,357 --> 00:20:11,425
Not a high school cheerleader.
A professional cheerleader.

422
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:13,360
- That doesn't make it better.
- Can I help you?

423
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:15,362
- She's a student.
- A graduate student.

424
00:20:15,396 --> 00:20:16,931
- In philosophy?
- Physical therapy.

425
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,133
There are better ways
to get back at me.

426
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,068
I'll put up a suggestion box.

427
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,503
Can I warn you about something?

428
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,105
You're a rich
and famous person.

429
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,474
And for that reason only,
she may want to sleep with you.

430
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:28,275
That didn't sound like something
that should come with a warning.

431
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,444
That sounded like something that
should come with balloons.

432
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:33,313
I loathe you right now.

433
00:20:33,348 --> 00:20:36,083
- You've got ink on your face.
- I work with pens!

434
00:20:36,117 --> 00:20:38,719
- Get a grip.
- Yeah, I know!

435
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:40,187
- Hello.
- Whatever!

436
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:41,789
- Good show tonight.
- Thank you.

437
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,224
He was talking to me!

438
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:45,660
Stay on the Tea Party.

439
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,829
Hard-core conservatives
are getting primaried.

440
00:20:47,863 --> 00:20:51,099
In six weeks I haven't heard
anything from the 44th floor.

441
00:20:51,134 --> 00:20:53,001
- How are they with this?
- Good. Good.

442
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:55,537
I'll tell you when there's
something to worry about.

443
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,575
So now we've really got something
to worry about 'cause he goes out--

444
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,844
What problem do we have?
7% drop?

445
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,846
We lose that when the Yankees
are playing the Red Sox.

446
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,317
Brad, why did you say now we've
really got something to worry about?

447
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,052
He goes after Jim DeMint.

448
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:11,889
<i>Mr. Wexler, I'd like to talk
about Senator DeMint's</i>

449
00:21:11,923 --> 00:21:13,490
recent statements
about gay marriage.

450
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,726
<i>He said it shouldn't be legal
because of the diseases</i>

451
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,894
<i>prevalent in the homosexual
population.</i>

452
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:20,363
- Am I mischaracterizing that?
- No, sir, you're not.

453
00:21:20,398 --> 00:21:23,233
<i>By diseases, Senator DeMint
is referring to HIV and AIDS?</i>

454
00:21:23,268 --> 00:21:26,470
- 18,000.
<i>- Exactly. Normal God-fearing heterosexual couples</i>

455
00:21:26,504 --> 00:21:28,438
- don't spread those kind of diseases.
- 18,000.

456
00:21:28,473 --> 00:21:30,507
As a matter of fact,
the rate of contraction of HIV

457
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,643
among gay couples is now lower
than it is among heterosexual couples.

458
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:35,912
18,000.
Nod if you copy.

459
00:21:35,947 --> 00:21:38,281
Well, if you're talking about Africa,
I'd have to see the statistics for myself.

460
00:21:38,315 --> 00:21:40,450
They're in a packet
right in front of you.

461
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:43,386
But let me ask you something.
Do you believe that the American soldiers

462
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,289
who fought in World War I
were good, moral people?

463
00:21:46,324 --> 00:21:47,958
I'm sure they were,
and God bless them.

464
00:21:47,992 --> 00:21:49,726
I don't think He did bless them

465
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:53,563
because 18,000 US troops were sidelined
by VD during that war.

466
00:21:53,598 --> 00:21:55,232
That sounds a little high
to be believed.

467
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:56,967
- Did you pull those numbers out of--
- I'm sorry.

468
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,968
- That number was wrong.
- That's what I thought.

469
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:01,438
It was 18,000 every day.

470
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,607
<i>So that
second segment was too long.</i>

471
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,009
- Yes, it won't happen again.
- Good.

472
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:09,712
- Uh-oh.
- Let's see who we have tonight.

473
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:12,081
Hi.

474
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:16,219
- You must be waiting for Will.
- Yes, I'm Darshana Yadav.

475
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:18,254
Mackenzie McHale.
So where's he--

476
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:20,189
- Hey, Darshana.
- Hey. I caught the end.

477
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,825
- You were great.
- Oh, thank you.

478
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,660
Do you mind waiting
just a second while I change?

479
00:22:23,694 --> 00:22:26,196
- Sure.
- Nice meeting you.

480
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:29,132
Spinning instructor?

481
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,134
<i>Neurologist at Columbia
Presbyterian.</i>

482
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:33,236
Chief of Surgery.
That would make her a brain surgeon.

483
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:35,906
Literally a brain surgeon.

484
00:22:37,842 --> 00:22:39,877
That's not hard to be.

485
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:48,920
I just couldn't be less
interested in WikiLeaks.

486
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:50,655
You're nuts.

487
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:52,390
The open sourcing
of classified information

488
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:55,494
is going to be an absolute game
changer for journalists of our generation.

489
00:22:55,528 --> 00:22:58,329
All I heard was sounds coming
from the mouth of a nerd.

490
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:00,065
- Have you scanned the WikiLeaks cables?
- No, Neal.

491
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:03,968
Because I spend my time trying to
find and protect my sources.

492
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:06,805
This right here is always
the swan song of the obsolete

493
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,507
when you stare the future
paradigm in the face.

494
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,210
"He on the side of technology wins."
You know who said that?

495
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,979
- It was you. I was sitting right here.
- Napoleon.

496
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:15,881
Things worked out well for him.

497
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:21,153
Weren't there girls
standing here a minute ago?

498
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:24,957
Yes, you scared them off
with your Wikinerd pitch.

499
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,474
Hey.

500
00:23:48,481 --> 00:23:52,318
I've been sitting here for two and a half hours
and I still don't know why.

501
00:23:52,352 --> 00:23:55,354
It's like being in
the cast of a Fellini film.

502
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:58,357
Was it all GOP bashing,
or did we cover anything else?

503
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,060
We did almost three times
as many international

504
00:24:01,094 --> 00:24:04,297
news stories as Fox
and MSNBC combined.

505
00:24:04,331 --> 00:24:06,298
And unless we're all blind,

506
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,068
the Tea Party is the one
doing the GOP bashing.

507
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:11,070
- Charlie, give me a break.
- Ask Bryce Delaney.

508
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:13,973
Bryce Delaney became
the sixth GOP incumbent

509
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:15,708
to be ousted by
a Tea Party candidate.

510
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,843
<i>The American Conservative Union</i>

511
00:24:17,877 --> 00:24:21,380
<i>gives Delaney a 97% rating
over his 10 terms in Congress.</i>

512
00:24:21,414 --> 00:24:23,782
He was a Deputy Whip,
he was state cochair

513
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:25,384
of the McCain/Palin campaign,

514
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,953
and he sponsored
or cosponsored 38 pieces

515
00:24:27,987 --> 00:24:30,022
of legislation
that were signed into law.

516
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:32,724
He lost his primary
to a dentist

517
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,393
72-28.

518
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:36,528
Congressman Delaney,
thank you for joining us.

519
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:37,996
Thank you.

520
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,064
Congressman, you have
a consistent voting record

521
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:41,666
on conservative issues,

522
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,701
and in the past five elections
you've won your district

523
00:24:43,736 --> 00:24:45,503
by double digits.
What happened?

524
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:47,705
My pollster tells me

525
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,575
that I gave the wrong answer
at a town hall meeting.

526
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:51,976
What was the question?

527
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,712
Is President Obama a socialist?

528
00:24:54,746 --> 00:24:56,313
And your answer?

529
00:24:56,348 --> 00:24:59,116
My answer was that
I disagree with the man

530
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,152
on how to run a government,

531
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:04,855
but the talk of him being
a socialist or a Marxist

532
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,458
or a Kenyan was a silly
distraction.

533
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:08,826
You paid a big price for that.

534
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,128
You were leading
in the polls at the time.

535
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:14,999
Will, there are brilliant conservative
minds in the Republican Party.

536
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,201
And the individual price
we are paying

537
00:25:17,236 --> 00:25:20,438
for not pretending
to be crazy is nothing

538
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:23,274
compared to the price that
the country is going to pay

539
00:25:23,309 --> 00:25:26,678
for not having a reasonable
opposition party.

540
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:29,581
You made another mistake,
too, right?

541
00:25:29,615 --> 00:25:32,851
- You're referring to HR2559.
- Yes.

542
00:25:32,885 --> 00:25:35,854
- I cosponsored a bill.
- With a Democrat.

543
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:38,290
Once you're elected,
you have a duty

544
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:41,059
to work with other people
who have been elected.

545
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,795
My friends across
the aisle had been elected.

546
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:46,865
What did HR2559 provide for?

547
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:52,570
It provided for
homeless veterans

548
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:55,574
<i>to receive housing vouchers</i>

549
00:25:55,608 --> 00:26:00,045
and services such as
counseling, job training.

550
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:02,981
<i>Thank you for your service
to your country, sir.</i>

551
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,983
You'll be missed in Congress.
Good luck.

552
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:07,485
<i>Thank you.</i>

553
00:26:11,023 --> 00:26:13,958
It's not strange I'm not hearing
anything from the 44th floor?

554
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:15,860
What were you expecting?

555
00:26:15,894 --> 00:26:18,729
It's just bizarre because the show's
taken a pretty sharp turn.

556
00:26:18,764 --> 00:26:20,431
Big fan. Keep it up.

557
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,567
She never watched the old show.

558
00:26:22,601 --> 00:26:25,503
- What?
- Maybe once or twice.

559
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:27,439
Too dumbed down?

560
00:26:27,473 --> 00:26:30,308
Has she seen the new show?

561
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:33,678
- That's a fair question.
- Charlie.

562
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:35,947
She's a Democrat.
She gives money.

563
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:38,217
She gives money to everybody.
She bets on all the horses in the race.

564
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,986
If there was a problem,
I'd have heard about it.

565
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:46,124
There's a retreat in
Telluride my mother and I

566
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,028
have been invited to every year
for the last nine years.

567
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:52,564
We're not here talking
about ratings, are we?

568
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:54,766
I wonder if what
we're about to see

569
00:26:54,801 --> 00:26:56,768
has anything to do with why
we weren't invited this year.

570
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:00,773
Does anybody mind if I start drinking
a lot of bourbon right now

571
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:04,943
and then a little while later
put my fist through his head?

572
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:07,279
I think you've had enough
bourbon for one lifetime.

573
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,780
Not my lifetime.

574
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,749
We lost David and Charles.

575
00:27:17,456 --> 00:27:19,390
Thank you for staying
late tonight.

576
00:27:19,425 --> 00:27:21,092
I really want to
get this one right tomorrow.

577
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:22,561
Don't we want
to get them all right?

578
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,129
You know what, Hef?

579
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:25,563
There's a Hooters
a few blocks from here

580
00:27:25,598 --> 00:27:27,032
<i>just filled with waitresses</i>

581
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:29,501
who are stocked
like a game fishing pond

582
00:27:29,535 --> 00:27:33,338
for you to go...
out like a fish with--

583
00:27:33,372 --> 00:27:36,441
- You lost the thread, right?
- Yeah.

584
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:38,176
Let's start from the top again.

585
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,111
Maggie.

586
00:27:40,146 --> 00:27:42,981
Uh, the Tea Party
presents itself

587
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:46,151
as a grassroots movement,
which means

588
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:49,053
it should be fiercely
resistant to central control,

589
00:27:49,087 --> 00:27:51,689
especially traditional,
uh, uh...

590
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:54,992
uh-- sorry.

591
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:58,729
Especially traditional
power structures.

592
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:01,599
<i>We're joined from Manhattan,
Kansas, by Mike Lyndall,</i>

593
00:28:01,633 --> 00:28:02,967
a construction contractor,

594
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,669
and Sheryl Bell,
a registered nurse.

595
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,838
Mr. Lyndall and Miss Bell
are the founders and cochairs

596

of the Riley County
Tea Party Express. Welcome.

597
00:28:10,976 --> 00:28:13,144
They're gonna say the Tea Party
represents the voice

598
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,346
of the true owners
of the United States.

599
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,482
Mike, tell us why you became involved
with the Tea Party movement.

600
00:28:18,517 --> 00:28:20,852
Well, first and foremost,
we want to take our country back.

601
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:23,354
All right, just to be clear,
is your country my country, too?

602
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:24,755
- Of course.
- Okay.

603
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,057
Who do you want to take
our country back from?

604
00:28:26,091 --> 00:28:28,392
We want to take it back from
a Congress and a president

605
00:28:28,427 --> 00:28:30,995
who've forgotten that government
derives its power from the consent

606
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,598
<i>of the governed and instead is at the beck
and call of special interests and corporations.</i>

607
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:37,702
You describe the Tea Party as
a grassroots movement, right?

608
00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:39,971
Absolutely.
We have no central control,

609
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:41,672
no traditional power structure.

610
00:28:41,707 --> 00:28:44,408
And that is something that
seems to confound the media.

611
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:46,944
- I'm sorry?
<i>- That's what confounds the media.</i>

612
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,512
It's what the media
doesn't get.

613
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:51,882
We are not being run by a
George Soros type figure.

614
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,951
We are "We the People."

615
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,819
- There it is.
- They walked right into it.

616
00:28:55,854 --> 00:29:00,024
If you follow the money, nearly all of it
eventually leads to AFP.

617
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:01,392
Where does your funding
come from?

618
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:04,494
What little funding we have
comes from private citizens

619
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:08,365
who mail in $5, $10, $1,
whatever they can spare.

620
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,268
Okay, have either of you ever heard
the name David Koch?

621
00:29:11,302 --> 00:29:13,670
- I'm sorry?
- David Koch.

622
00:29:13,704 --> 00:29:16,807
- No.
- Have you ever heard the name Charles Koch?

623
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:20,477
- No.
- Have you ever heard the name Koch Industries?

624
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,712
Are you talking
about Coca-Cola?

625
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:25,282
K-O-C-H. Have either of you
heard of Koch Industries?

626
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:28,751
- Nope.
- I think that very soon you will.

627
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:30,953
Koch Industries
is the second largest

628
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:33,790
<i>private company in the country.
Bigger than Coca-Cola.</i>

629
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,892
<i>And the Koch brothers'
personal wealth of $50 billion</i>

630
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:38,961
<i>is exceeded only by
Warren Buffett and Bill Gates,</i>

631
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:42,231
and they could buy and sell
George Soros 10 times over.

632
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,600
They own dozens of
companies and industries

633
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:46,903
<i>including oil and gas,
refining and chemicals,</i>

634
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:50,540
minerals, fertilizer, forestry,
polymers and fibers and ranching.

635
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:54,010
You two both attended the Texas Defending
the American Dream Summit

636
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,312
over the July 4th weekend?

637
00:29:55,346 --> 00:29:56,914
It was a Tea Party event.

638
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:59,516
The invitation--

639
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,852
Excuse me.

640
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,387
<i>The invitation read...</i>

641
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:05,189
"Today the voices
of average Americans

642
00:30:05,223 --> 00:30:08,259
are being drowned out
by lobbyists and special interests.

643
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:10,060
- But you can do something about it."
<i>- Yes.</i>

644
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:14,031
That summit was paid for entirely by
Americans For Prosperity,

645
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:17,302
AFP, which has two founders--
David and Charles Koch.

646
00:30:17,336 --> 00:30:20,305
In the last six months,
they've bankrolled Tea Party candidates

647
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:22,440
in excess of $40 million.

648
00:30:22,474 --> 00:30:25,710
Sheryl, Mike, are the Koch
brothers average Americans

649
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:29,413
whose voices are being drowned out
by lobbyists and special interests?

650
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,315
I'm confounded.

651
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:33,083
<i>If we review
the graphics package--</i>

652
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:35,519
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

653
00:30:35,553 --> 00:30:37,554
- Tamara?
- Yeah.

654
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:40,223
Call this SS-101.

655
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:43,159
<i>And I'm gonna want these
reviewed three times once they're loaded in.</i>

656
00:30:43,193 --> 00:30:45,127
<i>We screw this up, that's all people
talk about tomorrow.</i>

657
00:30:45,162 --> 00:30:46,763
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

658
00:30:46,797 --> 00:30:48,331
SS-101.

659
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,970
- Hey, Don.
- Yeah?

660
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:56,539
Have you seen Maggie?
She seemed a little funny

661
00:30:56,573 --> 00:30:58,374
in the conference room
and then she walked out.

662
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,609
Yeah, she's okay.

663
00:31:00,644 --> 00:31:02,044
She gets panic attacks.

664
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,914
She starts to get dizzy and shake
and she thinks she's dying.

665
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,916
Is she all right?

666
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:09,152
She's fine.
She just needs to be left alone.

667
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:11,020
She went out on the terrace
to get some air.

668
00:31:11,055 --> 00:31:14,224
Okay. You guys did
a good show tonight.

669
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:17,761
I wasn't aware of, you know,
what was going on with the McRib sandwich.

670
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:20,030
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

671
00:31:23,701 --> 00:31:26,402
Do not come down on the Kochs
without checking upstairs.

672
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:29,406
- Do you understand?
- Get your finger out of my face, Reese.

673
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,007
- Look--
- We stand for something.

674
00:31:31,041 --> 00:31:34,077
It's a moral obligation.
Get used to it.

675
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:38,215
<i>About 10 minutes ago.</i>

676
00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:40,784
<i>About 10 minutes ago
at a staff meeting.</i>

677
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:43,354
Yeah, I have--
I need to get back in there.

678
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:47,424
No, they're not <i>in</i> my pocket.

679
00:31:47,459 --> 00:31:49,326
They're not in
my purse because--

680
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:51,796
They weren't in
the medicine cabinet.

681
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,698
Lisa, the guys you bring
to the apartment

682
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:57,268
have got to stop
taking my Xanax.

683
00:31:57,302 --> 00:32:00,071
Shoot. Hang on a second.

684
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:02,774
But don't hang up.

685
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:05,176
- Sit back down.
- I'm fine.

686
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,445
Sit back down.

687
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:10,648
- Tell me what's happening.
- I just need a minute.

688
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:12,283
I'm gonna feel
your pulse, okay?

689
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:14,885
- You really don't need to.
- Shh.

690
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:19,123
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

691
00:32:19,157 --> 00:32:20,891
Where are you right now?

692
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:23,360
Are you having trouble breathing?
Can you hear me?

693
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:26,330
I'm on the upper terrace
of the AWM building,

694
00:32:26,365 --> 00:32:29,300
yes, and obviously yes.
Are you a nurse?

695
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,070
Some guys I was embedded
with got panic attacks.

696
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:35,207
- I'm gonna pass out.
- It feels like it, but you won't.

697
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:37,910
You're in the second stage
of the A-anxiety table

698
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:40,479
of army field manual
FM-2251:

699
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:42,748
"New Infantry Adaptation
to a Threatening Situation."

700
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:45,851
I'm in midtown Manhattan, Gomer Pyle.
You're in Fallujah.

701
00:32:45,886 --> 00:32:47,786
Start breathing
from your abdomen.

702
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:49,955
Imagine yourself
in a safe place

703
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,792
or something you like.
YouTube kittens.

704
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:55,328
I wish your face would stop
moving so I could punch it.

705
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:59,099
You're here. You're part of this group.
Everyone likes you.

706
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:03,003
Well, except for Carla in bookkeeping
who thinks you're a rube.

707
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:05,606
Should get back to the meeting.

708
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,308
The meeting's over.
Stay put.

709
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:10,010
- Did the copy for--
- Everything's done.

710
00:33:10,044 --> 00:33:12,045
You can check it
yourself later.

711
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,647
He's going after
the Koch brothers.

712
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:17,550
If you want to panic about something,
I think it's six to five and pick 'em

713
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:19,252
this time tomorrow night
the building blows up.

714
00:33:19,286 --> 00:33:21,954
Did you see a doctor?

715
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:24,156
Yeah, he prescribed Xanax.

716
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,692
- Did you take one?
- I didn't have them with me.

717
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:29,796
Someone like you should always have one
in your pocket or in your purse.

718
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,165
- I'll remember that.
- Keep breathing, okay?

719
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:34,834
You're safe.
You're awesome.

720
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,072
I'm gonna check
your pulse again.

721
00:33:43,945 --> 00:33:45,946
- How is it?
- Better.

722
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,382
A minute ago, it was like you
were taking sniper fire.

723
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:58,057
They were good guys?
The guys you were embedded with?

724
00:33:58,092 --> 00:34:01,628
They were the best people
I've ever met.

725
00:34:05,866 --> 00:34:07,534
You guys are a close second.

726
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:14,641
Don's hands are tied.

727
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:17,477
He got marching orders to
get the numbers up at 10:00.

728
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,545
And he's driving
a different car than Mac.

729
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,548
Elliot's smart, but he
can't do what Will does.

730
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:25,151
Plus, his salary
is tied to ratings.

731
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:27,353
Why are you telling me this?

732
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:30,556
He's a great guy and you
two should be friends.

733
00:34:30,591 --> 00:34:33,560
In the five months
I've been here,

734
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:36,563
you two have broken up four times
and gotten together five times.

735
00:34:36,597 --> 00:34:38,031
So there must be
a strong connection.

736
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:39,165
- Was that sarcastic?
- No.

737
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,433
- Really?
- Yeah.

738
00:34:40,468 --> 00:34:42,102
All right.

739
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:45,572
- That was obviously sarcastic.
- It wasn't.

740
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:48,007
I never knew what the word
smug meant until I met you.

741
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:50,977
You're 26 and you didn't know what
the word smug meant until this year?

742
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:53,312
- Right there.
- I wasn't being sarcastic.

743
00:34:53,347 --> 00:34:55,648
You guys obviously
have something.

744
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:01,788
My suggestion is
stop breaking up.

745
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:06,526
- Learn how to have a fight.
- Go on, Dr. Phil.

746
00:35:10,931 --> 00:35:13,066
You're breathing normally?

747
00:35:15,669 --> 00:35:17,337
Follow my finger.

748
00:35:24,145 --> 00:35:26,914
You've got a graphics producer
waiting in the edit bay.

749
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,325
Are you still there?

750
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:41,495
Yeah, that was him.

751
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,365
I think the best analogy
I can use is <i>Rocky II</i>.

752
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,934
Are you sure that's the best
analogy you can use?

753
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:50,038
- Hear me out.
- I'd be very surprised if my mother's seen <i>Rocky II</i>.

754
00:35:50,072 --> 00:35:52,941
Mrs. Lansing,
Rocky Balboa was a lefty.

755
00:35:52,975 --> 00:35:55,510
- Rocky was political?
- Left-handed.

756
00:35:55,544 --> 00:35:57,545
And for his rematch
with Apollo Creed,

757
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,381
<i>his trainer Burgess Meredith
makes him train as a righty.</i>

758
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:03,251
<i>And he fights round
after round as a righty</i>

759
00:36:03,285 --> 00:36:05,286
until Burgess Meredith
shouts, "Now,"

760
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:07,388
and Rocky comes at him
with his left.

761
00:36:07,423 --> 00:36:09,424
What the fuck
are you talking about?

762
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,292
<i>Just that Mackenzie McHale
got here, shouted, "Now,"</i>

763
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:13,027
and Will started swinging away.

764
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:17,065
Leave-- Hey, leave Mac out of this.

765
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,800
I shouted, "Now."
I'm Burgess Meredith.

766
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,903
This guy, he just don't want to beat you, see?

767
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:25,740
He wants to murder ya.

768
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:28,509
That was my best
Burgess Meredith.

769
00:36:28,543 --> 00:36:30,611
Is there something here
that's funny?

770
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:34,048
Yeah. We've been talking
about <i>Rocky II</i>.

771
00:36:34,082 --> 00:36:35,583
Brad, wrap it up.

772
00:36:57,439 --> 00:36:59,807
Here you go.

773
00:36:59,841 --> 00:37:02,710
- How much do you like me?
- I'm...

774
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,745
You know, I don't know
what's happening right now.

775
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:06,613
- Don and Maggie broke up.
- When?

776
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:08,248
Last week.

777
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:10,484
I'm sure they've married and divorced
three times since then.

778
00:37:10,518 --> 00:37:13,855
- No, it's real.
- What do you mean?

779
00:37:13,889 --> 00:37:16,124
Tess told Tamara,
Tamara told Kendra,

780
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:18,293
and Kendra talked to Maggie,
who confirmed it was over.

781
00:37:19,796 --> 00:37:21,630
So get in there.

782
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,967
- Get in there?
- Yeah.

783
00:37:25,001 --> 00:37:27,970
- I'm not gonna "get in there."
- Why not?

784
00:37:28,005 --> 00:37:31,340
I'm not going to swoop in like she's
a rent-controlled apartment.

785
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:34,543
She's probably really upset.

786
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:37,379
Plus, I was the one
who advised her

787
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:38,881
to stay together
during these times,

788
00:37:38,915 --> 00:37:40,416
so it would be pretty hypocritical
of me to suddenly--

789
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,552
- Wait.
- What?

790
00:37:43,587 --> 00:37:45,154
You advised her to do what?

791
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:49,125
I told her if she wants to stay together,
she has to not break up.

792
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,294
Based on what are you giving
relationship advice?

793
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:54,130
It--

794
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:56,332
This time it was logic.

795
00:37:56,366 --> 00:37:59,902
I know the answer to this question,
but I just want to hear you say it anyway.

796
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:02,071
What are you working on there?

797
00:38:02,106 --> 00:38:04,941
The story about people voting
against their own interest.

798
00:38:08,179 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm not swooping in.

799
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:14,484
The health care law
hasn't taken effect yet.

800
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:16,987
TARP was signed into law
by George W. Bush.

801
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,589
Name me the freedoms that
you had the day before

802
00:38:18,623 --> 00:38:20,924
President Obama was sworn in
that you don't have today.

803
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,127
What is someone supposed to
do with a bleeding Mexican?

804
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:25,463
What state, what city,
what county in this country

805
00:38:25,497 --> 00:38:27,331
is in danger of falling
under Sharia Law?

806
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:28,466
Tea Party candidate Allen West.

807
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,234
Tea Party candidate
Michele Bachmann.

808
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:31,769
Tea Party candidate
Tom Graves. Tim Griffin.

809
00:38:31,803 --> 00:38:33,270
Sean Duffy.
Jeff Duncan.

810
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:35,573
No, ma'am, teen pregnancy
<i>rose</i> over that period.

811
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:38,609
The largest demographic of Americans
living in poverty are children.

812
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:40,511
Abolishing the minimum wage
would create jobs.

813
00:38:40,545 --> 00:38:42,046
You know what else would?
Slavery.

814
00:38:42,081 --> 00:38:43,915
The public school system
has failed you.

815
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,583
As did three of your
college professors.

816
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,418
<i>It's going to come down,
as it always does,</i>

817
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,387
to who shows up.

818
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:52,690
And that takes us
to last night.

819
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,927
Here's something I want everyone
to watch at home tonight.

820
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,397
All right, precincts are closing
in Kentucky and Indiana.

821
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:02,167
AP's already calling it for Rogers,
Pence, and Burton.

822
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,835
John Yarmuth just picked
up the Kentucky 3rd.

823
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:05,603
I'm looking at Patty Murray
up by %1 with 60 in.

824
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,673
Arkansas State Secretary
just certified it for John Boozman.

825
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:10,675
<i>We've still got Reid up
by 12 in Clark County.</i>

826
00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:12,710
Why's Sportsbook still taking
bets at even money?

827
00:39:12,744 --> 00:39:14,412
- You're getting these?
- Yeah.

828
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:17,981
I'm looking at the exits.
Did anyone under 70 vote in this election?

829
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,917
I apologize, ma'am.
Happy birthday.

830
00:39:20,952 --> 00:39:23,753
Charlie.

831
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:25,889
Those polls closed 20 minutes ago.
What's going on?

832
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:28,792
I know he's a friend of yours.

833
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,697
He was a great public servant.

834
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:35,498
Call it red.

835
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:39,135
Maggie.
Ohio 12. Red.

836
00:39:41,138 --> 00:39:42,939
We're gonna need to
PRE-PRO that map graphic.

837
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,674
Joey, can you get that ready
and let Jake know when it's there?

838
00:39:44,709 --> 00:39:47,477
- <i>Yes, sir.</i> 
<i>- Two's down. I need you on Sabbith.</i>

839
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:49,378
<i>We'll need a phoner graphic
for the congressman-elect</i>

840
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:51,013
and a baseball card
of his opponent.

841
00:39:51,048 --> 00:39:53,215
- He's getting a dropline for that.
- Sabbith, two's down.

842
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:55,150
<i>No, he's back up.
Okay, go wide.</i>

843
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:58,253
<i>Do me a favor. I need you to fix
1918 and add the source.</i>

844
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,455
<i>I'm looking at the stack
and you're missing 1825.</i>

845
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,390
I see it.
It's just not in the stack.

846
00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:05,126
Will, the brand-new governor
of Wisconsin just said,

847
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,661
"Tonight I want
to tell every worker,

848
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,564
every family, and every
business big or small in this state

849
00:40:09,632 --> 00:40:11,433
that you have an ally
in the governor's office."

850
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:13,970
Isn't he the one who wants to bust the unions?
Am I mixing him up?

851
00:40:14,004 --> 00:40:15,671
Can you get him to go
to Elliot a little more?

852
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:17,006
Can you get Elliot to say
something other than

853
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,975
how beautiful it is
to see democracy in action?

854
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,411
- I'm trying.
- Easy, man.

855
00:40:21,446 --> 00:40:23,213
Let's go to three.

856
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:24,915
<i>Elliot, tell us what
we're looking at.</i>

857
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:29,152
Well, we are looking at American
democracy in action, Will,

858
00:40:29,187 --> 00:40:32,189
and it is really
a beautiful sight to see.

859
00:40:33,524 --> 00:40:35,492
Yes, it is.
Sloan Sabbith.

860
00:40:35,526 --> 00:40:38,729
We're looking at an electorate that's
older and more conservative.

861
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:42,032
Early exits suggest a quarter
of all voters, at least so far,

862
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:46,370
were 65 and older, and 41% identify
themselves with the Tea Party.

863
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:48,606
Kyle, we all remember
those Tea Party signs

864
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:50,842
that said, "Keep your government
hands off my Social Security."

865
00:40:50,876 --> 00:40:53,879
How do you explain people
who are on Social Security

866
00:40:53,913 --> 00:40:57,316
voting for candidates who could well
endanger Social Security?

867
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,085
I can't.

868
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,821
Well, they don't call you
an analyst for nothing.

869
00:41:01,856 --> 00:41:05,158
We've got 12 minutes before
the next round of polls close.

870
00:41:05,192 --> 00:41:07,427
We'll throw it now to Terry Smith
and her team in Washington

871
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,095
and see you on the other side.

872
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,864
Terry, I don't know how you're gonna
follow Kyle, but give it a try.

873
00:41:11,898 --> 00:41:13,432
We're out.

874
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:16,836
Hey, you want to
give me a break?

875
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,938
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus.

876
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,873
It was a joke.

877
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,878
Come here.

878
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:32,483
Get in the game,
would you, please?

879
00:41:32,517 --> 00:41:34,418
I am in there doing everything I can
to get Mac to get him

880
00:41:34,452 --> 00:41:35,953
to go to you
and he is doing it.

881
00:41:35,987 --> 00:41:37,755
He is inviting you
to become a star.

882
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:40,992
Would you stop being so fucking enthralled
with the act of punching a ballot?

883
00:41:41,026 --> 00:41:44,395
Get back here.
Get back here.

884
00:41:45,497 --> 00:41:49,200
Don't talk to me like that.

885
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:51,335
I mean, I don't know
who you think I am,

886
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:54,739
but don't talk to me like
I am a disappointing child.

887
00:41:54,773 --> 00:41:56,974
You got three choices.

888
00:41:57,009 --> 00:41:59,544
One: Get back
together with Maggie

889
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:02,813
so you can be the regular
prick that I like

890
00:42:02,848 --> 00:42:06,517
and not the bonus prick that I've been
getting for the past week.

891
00:42:06,551 --> 00:42:09,654
Two: Don't get back
together with Maggie

892
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:12,123
and get over it.

893
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:15,493
Three: You're fired.

894
00:42:15,527 --> 00:42:17,495
Choose.

895
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:21,199
Okay. Everything you
just said was right.

896
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:25,637
Let me also say I'm not the one

897
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:28,373
who wants to be a star,
Mama Rose.

898
00:42:29,776 --> 00:42:32,177
I don't know that reference.

899
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:35,047
It's from <i>Gypsy</i>.

900
00:42:35,082 --> 00:42:37,717
Ethel Merman's a stage mother
who really pushes her daughter--

901
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:39,952
I don't have time to explain
the plot of <i>Gypsy</i>.

902
00:42:39,986 --> 00:42:42,121
Yeah, sure, okay.
Just...

903
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,491
pretend I gave
a better pep talk.

904
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:48,394
- Okay?
- Done.

905
00:42:55,135 --> 00:42:57,737
I printed this hot note.
I'm adding it to your binder.

906
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,406
Lexington, Kentucky,
just elected their first openly gay mayor.

907
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,974
You might want to keep it
in your pocket.

908
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:05,245
Here's what the Grayson camp
sent us on his concession.

909
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:07,180
And I want to say
something to you

910
00:43:07,214 --> 00:43:09,115
that's both inappropriate
and insubordinate.

911
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,686
- What was the last one?
- I want to say something to you that's inappropriate,

912
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,555
insubordinate,
and grounds for termination.

913
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,359
You could give Mac a break and have
the women meet you at the restaurant.

914
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:33,073
That was inappropriate
and insubordinate,

915
00:43:33,107 --> 00:43:34,441
- but I don't care.
- Thank you.

916
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:36,443
You should know your
head's up your ass.

917
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:39,880
- Will, I know--
- You don't know anything, Maggie.

918
00:43:39,914 --> 00:43:42,249
I've got the image of Mackenzie with that--
with her ex-boy--

919
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:44,285
It won't come out.

920
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,655
I need the team from <i>Inception</i> to come
and remove the image from--

921
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:50,091
Look, I'm not
doing it on purpose.

922
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,094
I'm not rubbing her face
in anything.

923
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:54,697
I'm simply not considering
her feelings at all.

924
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:00,904
Yeah, I just heard
myself say that.

925
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,707
Lexington, Kentucky,
and the Grayson statement.

926
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,018
The <i>Times</i> are reporting
Rick Scott spent 75 million

927
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,054
on his campaign in Florida.
That's the most ever on a gubernatorial race.

928
00:44:19,088 --> 00:44:20,522
Joey, I'm sending
you the quote.

929
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:22,691
- Make it a tear on the NYT background.
- Copy.

930
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,559
- <i>You got a second?</i>
- Are you joking?

931
00:44:24,593 --> 00:44:26,828
I wanted to tell you
that I shouldn't have--

932
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:29,964
- I wanted to apologize.
<i>- This operation is unbelievable.</i>

933
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:32,133
You guys are like
air traffic controllers.

934
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:34,668
Honey, you're gonna tell me
if I'm in the way, right?

935
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:37,170
No, you're-- No.
Wade, this is--

936
00:44:37,205 --> 00:44:40,240
I know who this is.
I am not worthy.

937
00:44:40,275 --> 00:44:43,076
You keep kicking the Tea Party
to hell and back.

938
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:44,978
They won the battle,
you win the war.

939
00:44:45,013 --> 00:44:46,813
And I'll tell you what else,
it's good business, too.

940
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:49,149
Where would Murrow have
been without McCarthy?

941
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:52,019
- Good to meet you.
- This is my friend Wade Campbell.

942
00:44:52,053 --> 00:44:54,388
She's so British.
We're a little more than friends.

943
00:44:54,422 --> 00:44:56,790
<i>Mac, you want a cyber panel
next to Will or a lower-third?</i>

944
00:44:56,825 --> 00:44:59,025
She's not British.
She's American.

945
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,762
Uh, your call.
A cyber panel. Will--

946
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:06,233
Mac said I could watch tonight so long as
I promised to stay out of your eye line.

947
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:08,335
She said you never
come in here, so...

948
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,471
Yeah, no. I think I got lost
on my way to the men's room.

949
00:45:10,505 --> 00:45:14,575
Martin, would you take Wade and
show him the decision desk?

950
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,377
I would love that.

951
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,680
Sure.

952
00:45:22,852 --> 00:45:25,655
We've been dating
for about three months.

953
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,991
I'm sorry.

954
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,095
No. This is exactly what
was supposed to happen.

955
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,663
You're doing great in here.

956
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:36,366
- Thanks, Will.
- Thanks.

957
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,640
The McClatchy masthead has
to go with that 35-50 graphic.

958
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:55,217
- Will.
<i>- Yes, ma'am?</i>

959
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:57,085
You've got to ask the Tea Party
about the debt ceiling.

960
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,687
- Huh?
- The debt ceiling.

961
00:45:58,721 --> 00:46:00,355
Boehner'll keep them in line
on the debt ceiling vote.

962
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,357
<i>They're freshmen.
They sit in the back.</i>

963
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:05,060
Half of them won their primaries by beating
candidates Boehner endorsed.

964
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:07,495
It's pro forma. It's one sentence
on one piece of paper.

965
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,597
It doesn't give the government permission
to borrow more money.

966
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,533
It gives the government permission to
pay back the money we already borrowed.

967
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:15,102
Do their constituents
know that?

968
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:18,706
- <i>In three, two, roll in.</i>
- Fuck.

969
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:31,318
Welcome back to ACN's
election night coverage.

970
00:46:31,353 --> 00:46:33,520
If you're just joining us,
the Republican Party

971
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:36,223
will be the majority party
in the House of Representatives

972
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:38,292
<i>for at least
the next two years.</i>

973
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:41,596
We're joined live now by the newest
member of the 112th Congress,

974
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,632
Frank Guidry, representing
Colorado's 8th district.

975
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,500
Congressman-elect,
congratulations.

976
00:46:46,535 --> 00:46:48,870
- Thank you for joining us.
- Good to be here.

977
00:46:48,904 --> 00:46:50,972
Mr. Guidry, you campaigned

978
00:46:51,007 --> 00:46:53,007
on a promise of
fiscal responsibility.

979
00:46:53,042 --> 00:46:55,210
And I plan to govern
the same way.

980
00:46:56,913 --> 00:46:59,715
<i>Mr. Guidry, in a few months,
you'll be asked to cast</i>

981
00:46:59,749 --> 00:47:02,717
the most important vote you'll ever cast
as a member of the House.

982
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:04,986
Will you be voting
to raise the debt ceiling?

983
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:08,957
Will, I will not be
casting a single vote

984
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:11,426
<i>to spend a single dollar
that we do not have.</i>

985
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,362
Sir, that's not what-- That's not--

986
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:17,465
Mr. Guidry,
this is Sloan Sabbith.

987
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:19,133
That's not what
the debt ceiling--

988
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:20,568
I'm having trouble hearing you.

989
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:22,870
We've got some happy
people here behind me.

990
00:47:22,904 --> 00:47:25,205
That's not-- Sir, that's not
what the debt ceiling does.

991
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,942
- Are you able to hear us?
- Just barely.

992
00:47:27,976 --> 00:47:30,411
Are you aware of the consequences of
not raising the debt ceiling?

993
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:31,912
I'm sorry, say that again.

994
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:33,380
Are you aware of
the consequences,

995
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:35,983
<i>the immediate global
consequences</i>

996
00:47:36,018 --> 00:47:38,119
of the US defaulting
on its loan payments?

997
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:40,154
I'm sorry, guys.
I just can't hear you.

998
00:47:40,189 --> 00:47:43,124
<i>We'll have to pick this up
another time.</i>

999
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,797
All right.

1000
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:51,800
Tess, good job.
Go home.

1001
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:53,969
Thank you.

1002
00:47:56,005 --> 00:47:59,341
Martin, nice work.
Get some sleep.

1003
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:01,709
- <i>Hey, Jim.</i>
- Yes, sir?

1004
00:48:01,744 --> 00:48:04,946
Smart people are gonna offer
you jobs for more money.

1005
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,815
Before you take one,
talk to me, okay?

1006
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:08,517
That won't be an issue, sir.

1007
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:10,185
Come have a drink
with Will and me.

1008
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,188
Oh, thank you very much,
but it's pretty late

1009
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,590
and it's a work night
and I got to be in early.

1010
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,593
Oh, be a damn newsman,
would you?

1011
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,396
- Yes, sir.
- Kids.

1012
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,465
<i>The final tally-- colon--</i>

1013
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:24,836
Republicans pick up
63 seats in House-- comma--

1014
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:28,005
six seats in Senate-- comma--
and eight governorships.

1015
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,375
Colorado, Alaska, and Washington
still too close to call-- period.

1016
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:35,479
This is ACN's Live Election
Blog signing off-- period.

1017
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,984
I'm sorry, Dave,
but I'm afraid I can't do that.

1018
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:44,454
Laugh all you want,
but Kubrick got it exactly right.

1019
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,890
HAL malfunctioned
in a very realistic way.

1020
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,725
Stop.

1021
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,827
Good work tonight.

1022
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,435
Hey.

1023
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,810
I'm just gonna...

1024
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:09,980
go tell her she did a good job.

1025
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:46,885
Brutal.

1026
00:49:46,952 --> 00:49:48,620
No words.

1027
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,856
I have no words to
describe what I just--

1028
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,525
- But you're still talking.
- No words.

1029
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:57,462
That's it.
That's the last six months.

1030
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:00,866
- <i>Thanks, Brad.</i>
- Could we have the room, please?

1031
00:50:17,919 --> 00:50:20,687
Moses and Jesus
are playing golf.

1032
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:23,790
Moses steps up to the tee
and hits a beautiful shot

1033
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:28,128
<i>250 yards straight down
the middle of the fairway.</i>

1034
00:50:28,163 --> 00:50:31,966
Jesus steps up to the tee
and hooks the ball into the trees.

1035
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,770
Jesus looks up into the heavens,
raises his arms.

1036
00:50:35,804 --> 00:50:38,339
Suddenly the sky darkens.

1037
00:50:38,373 --> 00:50:40,374
A thunderclap rings out.

1038
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:43,511
<i>Rain pours down and a stream
rises among the trees.</i>

1039
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:46,948
The golf ball, floating on top,
finds its way

1040
00:50:46,982 --> 00:50:48,516
into the mouth of a fish.

1041
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,419
Then a bird flies down and
takes the fish and the ball

1042
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:56,089
out over the green,
drops it in the cup for a hole in one.

1043
00:50:56,124 --> 00:51:00,261
Jesus turns to Moses
with a satisfied grin.

1044
00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:02,162
And Moses says, "Look,

1045
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:06,667
you want to play golf
or you want to fuck around?"

1046
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:10,138
What in God's name has happened

1047
00:51:10,172 --> 00:51:11,539
to <i>News Night</i>
over the last six months?

1048
00:51:11,574 --> 00:51:14,743
- Leona--
- Do not laugh.

1049
00:51:14,778 --> 00:51:17,813
Leona, the ratings
have stabilized.

1050
00:51:17,848 --> 00:51:19,649
We're doing a show
you can be proud of.

1051
00:51:19,683 --> 00:51:22,151
And I'll get them back
to where they used to be.

1052
00:51:22,185 --> 00:51:24,353
What happened to
human interest stories?

1053
00:51:24,387 --> 00:51:26,756
Obesity, breast cancer,
hurricanes,

1054
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,991
older women having babies,
iPhones--

1055
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:30,826
He was great at that shit.

1056
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:32,394
He was sleeping
during that shit.

1057
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:33,996
And whose idea was it
to wake him up?

1058
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,865
- <i>For the third time, it was mine.</i>
- Yeah.

1059
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,035
I engineered a situation
wherein an executive producer

1060
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,339
with a unique ability to bring
out the very best in an anchor

1061
00:51:43,373 --> 00:51:45,841
with a unique ability
were paired

1062
00:51:45,876 --> 00:51:49,178
to do a news broadcast this company
can and should be proud of.

1063
00:51:49,212 --> 00:51:52,314
And rebrand ACN as MSNBC's
more combative brother?

1064
00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:53,882
- <i>We did the news.</i>
- For the left.

1065
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:57,052
- For the center.
- Are you fucking out of your mind?

1066
00:51:57,086 --> 00:51:59,888
For the center, Leona.
Facts are the center.

1067
00:51:59,923 --> 00:52:02,892
Facts. We don't pretend that
certain facts are in dispute

1068
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:05,895
to give the appearance of fairness
to people who don't believe them.

1069
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,598
Balance is irrelevant to me.

1070
00:52:08,632 --> 00:52:12,935
<i>It doesn't have anything to do
with truth, logic, or reality.</i>

1071
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,639
He didn't go on the air telling people
to give peace a chance.

1072
00:52:16,673 --> 00:52:19,775
But evolution?
The jury's back on that one.

1073
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:23,144
He humiliated congressional
candidates on my air.

1074
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:25,280
- It's not your air, Leona.
- Excuse me.

1075
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:27,115
- <i>He needs to continue.</i>
- Listen to me.

1076
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:29,917
Listen to me!
America just elected

1077
00:52:29,952 --> 00:52:33,888
the most dangerous and addle-minded
Congress in my lifetime.

1078
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:36,824
I have business in front
of this Congress, Charlie!

1079
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,667
Reese, why don't you
give us a minute?

1080
00:52:46,702 --> 00:52:47,935
He can stay.

1081
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:50,404
Reese, get the fuck out.

1082
00:52:55,878 --> 00:52:57,946
I'll be right outside.

1083
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:06,821
How would you like me
to respond

1084
00:53:06,856 --> 00:53:09,224
to your unfiltered
contempt for my son?

1085
00:53:09,258 --> 00:53:11,192
By telling him
to get a paper route.

1086
00:53:11,227 --> 00:53:12,594
Look, pal--

1087
00:53:12,628 --> 00:53:14,596
<i>What the hell is his job,
anyway?</i>

1088
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,164
President of this company.

1089
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:17,766
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

1090
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:19,902
It means he's gonna
have my job one day.

1091
00:53:19,936 --> 00:53:22,571
Please, please let me
be dead by then.

1092
00:53:22,605 --> 00:53:24,440
I'd be happy to arrange it.

1093
00:53:24,474 --> 00:53:28,411
So Will pissed off whoever you were
sitting next to at dinner Saturday night?

1094
00:53:28,445 --> 00:53:30,880
I thought you got where
you are by being fearless.

1095
00:53:30,914 --> 00:53:35,718
No, I got where I am
by knowing who to fear.

1096
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:38,120
And the Koch brothers
are not playing around,

1097
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:39,521
if that's what you're
talking about.

1098
00:53:39,556 --> 00:53:42,424
They drop Brink's trucks
on people they disagree with.

1099
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:44,860
You and me.

1100
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:47,562
Leona, you can't possibly
expect us to tailor

1101
00:53:47,597 --> 00:53:50,332
our news coverage to what
best suits our corporate--

1102
00:53:50,366 --> 00:53:52,801
Let's start over.

1103
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:56,405
And this time,
disabuse yourself of the idea

1104
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:58,307
that this is a conversation
between equals

1105
00:53:58,342 --> 00:54:01,377
<i>where I make an argument,
you make a counterargument,</i>

1106
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:03,312
and we agree to disagree.

1107
00:54:03,346 --> 00:54:07,617
Our cable news division
accounts for less than 3%

1108
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:09,886
of AWM's annual revenue.

1109
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,955
You don't make money
for stockholders,

1110
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:15,558
<i>which I have a fiduciary
responsibility to do.</i>

1111
00:54:15,592 --> 00:54:18,962
Well, last night,
the voters ousted 21% of Congress,

1112
00:54:18,996 --> 00:54:21,431
including seven members
of the House Subcommittee

1113
00:54:21,465 --> 00:54:23,332
on Communications
and Technology.

1114
00:54:23,367 --> 00:54:27,336
Three of those seven are AWM's
most reliable friends on the Hill.

1115
00:54:27,371 --> 00:54:30,706
Now, the congressmen that
will be replacing them

1116
00:54:30,741 --> 00:54:33,142
are the same people that
Will has been making look

1117
00:54:33,177 --> 00:54:35,311
like fucking morons
for the last six months.

1118
00:54:35,345 --> 00:54:38,081
They've done a pretty good job
making themselves look like morons.

1119
00:54:38,115 --> 00:54:41,084
I have business before this Congress,
Charlie.

1120
00:54:41,118 --> 00:54:43,119
And whatever you may
think of these people,

1121
00:54:43,153 --> 00:54:45,054
which is the same thing
I think of them,

1122
00:54:45,088 --> 00:54:48,491
<i>they hold the keys
to the future of AWM.</i>

1123
00:54:48,525 --> 00:54:52,194
Anything more than a pack of gum,
and I have to go to Congress for permission.

1124
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:55,364
I don't make the rules,
but I do abide by them.

1125
00:54:55,399 --> 00:54:58,133
- News organizations...
- Careful with the lectures.

1126
00:54:58,168 --> 00:55:01,670
Are a public trust
with an ability to inform

1127
00:55:01,705 --> 00:55:04,473
and influence
the national conversation.

1128
00:55:04,507 --> 00:55:07,209
I know.
That's why I bought one.

1129
00:55:11,514 --> 00:55:13,315
All right,

1130
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,018
they're not candidates anymore.
They are congressmen,

1131
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:17,553
and he is gonna lay off.

1132
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:20,924
He's not gonna
lay off anything.

1133
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:23,660
- Oh, yes, he is.
<i>- Let me ask you something.</i>

1134
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:25,928
And don't forget
I've known you for 20 years.

1135
00:55:25,963 --> 00:55:29,065
<i>If Joe McCarthy sat on
the House Subcommittee</i>

1136
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:31,134
for Communications
and Technology,

1137
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:32,335
would you have told
Murrow to lay off?

1138
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:34,670
- No.
<i>- Why?</i>

1139
00:55:34,705 --> 00:55:37,006
Because he was
a genuinely bad guy.

1140
00:55:37,074 --> 00:55:40,042
Michele Bachmann's called
for Congress to be investigated

1141
00:55:40,077 --> 00:55:42,745
to ferret out House members
who are un-American.

1142
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,280
Michele Bachmann is a hairdo.

1143
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:46,148
I'm not worried about
Michele Bachmann.

1144
00:55:46,183 --> 00:55:49,251
I wonder how many people
weren't worried about McCarthy.

1145
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:54,389
You know, Charlie, a lot of people
might argue that Will is on a witch hunt.

1146
00:55:54,424 --> 00:55:57,693
And a lot of people might argue
there are witches out there.

1147
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:01,463
I'll fire him, Charlie.

1148
00:56:03,066 --> 00:56:04,266
What?

1149
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,301
I'm not asking him to lie.

1150
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:08,303
I'm not asking him
to cover anything up.

1151
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:12,107
But he's going to tone it down
or I'm going to fire him.

1152
00:56:12,142 --> 00:56:15,845
Well, best of luck trying
to program against him.

1153
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,849
Oh, I don't have to.
He's got a non-compete clause in his contract.

1154
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:21,885
He's gonna have to stay off
television for three years.

1155
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,654
That's a death sentence.

1156
00:56:23,688 --> 00:56:25,256
It is.

1157
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,692
How would you possibly
explain firing

1158
00:56:27,726 --> 00:56:29,593
the second most watched
anchor on cable?

1159
00:56:29,628 --> 00:56:33,431
By creating
what we call context.

1160
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:36,100
His firing would be
viewed as a noble step

1161
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:39,571
on the part of a corporation willing to
sacrifice ratings for integrity.

1162
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,373
You'd manufacture
a reason to do it?

1163
00:56:42,408 --> 00:56:45,443
I've got a really good job,
Charlie.

1164
00:56:45,478 --> 00:56:48,913
Now you want to play golf
or do you want to fuck around?

1165
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,088
Fellas, that was election coverage.
Tell 'em, Charlie.

1166
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,289
Where the hell are we?

1167
00:56:58,323 --> 00:57:01,259
It's my understanding
this is a karaoke bar

1168
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:04,495
with affordable food and drinks that
stays open late

1169
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,232
and staffers come here
after work to socialize.

1170
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:09,868
When you describe it,
it really sounds like <i>Brigadoon</i>.

1171
00:57:09,902 --> 00:57:11,870
- Hey, you know what?
- Shut up?

1172
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:13,638
- <i>Yeah. You know why?</i>
- Where's Mackenzie?

1173
00:57:13,673 --> 00:57:17,076
- That's why.
- I didn't meet him until tonight either.

1174
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:19,445
That's all right.
I like being here.

1175
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:21,214
Election night.
Just the guys.

1176
00:57:21,248 --> 00:57:24,116
And-- Yeah.

1177
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:27,353
Elliot got in trouble tonight
for saying something

1178
00:57:27,387 --> 00:57:29,688
that was worth saying.

1179
00:57:29,723 --> 00:57:32,224
Every two years,
we drive to a fire station

1180
00:57:32,259 --> 00:57:33,592
and overthrow the government

1181
00:57:33,627 --> 00:57:35,661
and there isn't a policeman
in the street.

1182
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:41,634
I love doing the news.

1183
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:43,703
Hang on.

1184
00:57:43,737 --> 00:57:46,205
Who e-mails you at
2:00 AM during a toast?

1185
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,809
I think whoever it is probably
didn't know about the toast.

1186
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:53,312
Leona Lansing wants to
see me at 10:00 AM

1187
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:54,914
on the 40th floor
conference room.

1188
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:56,949
What do you think it's about?

1189
00:57:56,983 --> 00:58:00,453
I think she wants
to say good job.

1190
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:02,922
All right,
to the 112th Congress.

1191
00:58:02,956 --> 00:58:05,724
Godspeed and God bless America.

1192
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:08,527
God bless America.

1193
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:12,427
