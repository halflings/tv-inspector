00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,532
Will, there's a comment on
your website you need to see.

2
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:06,640
"I got a bullet for you, too.
You think I'm fuckin' around?"

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,976
Charlie, I want a body on him
until this guy's in handcuffs.

4
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,078
- No way.
- <i>You're not gonna have a choice.</i>

5
00:00:11,113 --> 00:00:13,381
- The insurance company makes that call.
- How does this work?

6
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,053
I'm with you any place that isn't
your home or your office.

7
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:18,788
Speaking of your roommate,
I had a great idea.

8
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:20,523
I'm fixing her up with Jim.

9
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:21,825
This is Maggie's roommate Lisa.

10
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,494
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

11
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,795
We're not in a relationship.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,134
She calls me at night and she says,
"Should I come over?"

13
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:30,270
- And what am I supposed to say?
- You say yes.

14
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:32,706
- Am I losing Maggie?
- No.

15
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,709
<i>Are you good at knowing
these things?</i>

16
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:37,431
No.

17
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:40,072
This whole file here.
Every page is about Mackenzie.

18
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,939
You've had a lot going on
for a long time.

19
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:45,215
Very serious stuff.
You're being hunted.

00:02:31,715 --> 00:02:33,249
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

22
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:36,103
- <i>That's not important.</i>
- It's important to me.

23
00:02:36,126 --> 00:02:38,454
<i>Charlie, this is the first
of several calls</i>

24
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,289
<i>and its only purpose
is to demonstrate</i>

25
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:43,759
- <i>my credibility as a source.</i>
- How about you tell me your name?

26
00:02:43,793 --> 00:02:46,486
- <i>Call me Deep Throat.</i>
- I'm not calling you Deep Throat.

27
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,397
That's a sacred pseudonym.

28
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:53,201
And by the way, Deep Throat
gave Woodward his name on the first call.

29
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:55,537
He said,
"Hi, this is Mark Felt.

30
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:57,972
I'm the deputy director
of the FBI

31
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,708
and I want to talk to you about
this story you're writing."

32
00:03:00,743 --> 00:03:03,511
- So who is this?
<i>- I don't care what you call me.</i>

33
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:06,313
<i>Call me late for dinner.
I'm not calling to give you a tip.</i>

34
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:08,549
<i>I'm simply establishing
my credibility.</i>

35
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,284
But you're not establishing
your credibility.

36
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,120
- <i>I'm about to.</i>
- Go ahead.

37
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,689
<i>In roughly 90 minutes,
you're going to get an email</i>

38
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:17,458
<i>from the White House
telling you to get to work.</i>

39
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:19,959
- I am?
<i>- That's it.</i>

40
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:22,562
Should I be telling people
to get to work now?

41
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:25,065
- <i>And do what?</i>
- You tell me.

42
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:27,200
<i>If I could,
I would have already.</i>

43
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,834
<i>I'm not trying to play a game.</i>

44
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:30,636
<i>I have 7:30.</i>

45
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:32,705
<i>At 9:00 Eastern,
you're going to get an email</i>

46
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:34,806
<i>from White House
Press Secretary Jay Carney</i>

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,442
<i>telling you to get to work.</i>

48
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:38,510
<i>And when that happens,
you'll know that I was for real.</i>

49
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:40,979
- Is anyone in danger?
<i>- No.</i>

50
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,914
If someone's in danger
and you're not telling--

51
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:45,784
<i>No one's in danger, Charlie.
This isn't a scary call.</i>

52
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:47,919
<i>I'm just establishing
my credibility.</i>

53
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:51,722
Why? Why do you need me to
believe you're credible?

54
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:55,059
Hello?

55
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,400
- What was that?
- I don't know.

56
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,335
You should probably say a few words.

57
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,536
- Really?
- Yeah.

58
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:07,137
- What do I say?
- What do you want to say?

59
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,505
"Please get out of my home"?

60
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:12,309
Everyone, Will wants
to say a few words.

61
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,777
I really don't.
But here you all are

62
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:16,946
<i>in my apartment, socializing.</i>

63
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,649
Coworkers, friends, family...

64
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:22,018
in my apartment

65
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:24,320
just like in my nightmares.

66
00:04:24,354 --> 00:04:26,589
This is a party to celebrate
the one year and one week

67
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:29,958
anniversary of what we used
to call <i>News Night</i> 2.0.

68
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:32,060
Remember that?

69
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:35,131
I think we're up to about
<i>News Night</i> 174.0,

70
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,899
but I'm confident we're gonna
get it right one of these days.

71
00:04:37,934 --> 00:04:39,501
So have a good time
at the party.

72
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:42,637
And please, please know,
from the bottom of my heart,

73
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,773
that I'm not gonna think
it's rude if you leave early.

74
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:49,710
- Good?
- Goose bumps.

75
00:04:49,745 --> 00:04:52,614
Resume being here.

76
00:04:52,648 --> 00:04:55,282
Okay, this is
an Australian actress.

77
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:57,351
- Nicole Kidman.
- No, she was in <i>Spiderman</i>.

78
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,553
- Time.
- Let me see. It's Christian Bale.

79
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:03,590
English, <i>Batman</i>, and a man.

80
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:05,159
<i>Who am I thinking of?</i>

81
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:08,728
<i>♪ Sunshine go away today... ♪</i>

82
00:05:08,763 --> 00:05:11,430
- Up chickens.
- Down chickens.

83
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:12,598
- It's not there.
- Not there.

84
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:15,000
- <i>It's not there.</i>
<i>- Not there.</i>

85
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,741
<i>♪ How much does it cost?

00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:25,944

92
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:42,459
Just to be clear
for you youngsters,

93
00:05:42,494 --> 00:05:44,161
this isn't recreational.
It's medicinal.

94
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:46,597
When I was a junior in high school,
I was already throwing

95
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:50,201
a 74-mile-an-hour fastball,
which puts a lot of stress on your landing leg.

96
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:53,737
I also have epicondylitis in my elbow
due to my mess-you-up breaking ball.

97
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,073
You know, if you just want to bake,
that's okay with me.

98
00:05:56,107 --> 00:05:58,441
You don't need to go to WebMD
to come up with symptoms.

99
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:01,411
I don't want to bake. I'm telling you
I was an awesome high school athlete,

100
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,046
but it's left me in constant physical pain
in my knee and elbow.

101
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,283
And experts say that medical marijuana
relieves the pain and inflammation

102
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,419
with fewer side effects than
prescription pain killers.

103
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,487
- Which experts?
- The ones on WebMD.

104
00:06:11,522 --> 00:06:14,956
Anyway, thank you and thank your friend
in LA for getting this for me.

105
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,858
No problem.
He said they're pretty strong.

106
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:18,727
So you should just break off
a quarter and eat that.

107
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,830
And when this guy says they're strong,
they're strong.

108
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:23,599
I ate two.

109
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:27,536
Okay.
Well, enjoy yourself

110
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,371
and we'll see you
in 12 to 14 hours.

111
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,306
It's fine.
I have incredibly high tolerance.

112
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,741
That's why I can't feel
the Vicodin.

113
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:36,410
You took Vicodin
and then ate two cookies?

114
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:38,646
- Mm-hmm.
- He's fine. You're fine.

115
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,215
Just stay away
from anything dangerous.

116
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,618
Electricity.
You know, outside.

117
00:06:43,652 --> 00:06:45,453
I'm fine.
I don't feel it at all.

118
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:46,720
- You will.
- We'll see.

119
00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:48,821
My body has the physical
tolerance of 10 men.

120
00:06:48,856 --> 00:06:50,790
Doctors have called me
a medical marvel.

121
00:06:50,824 --> 00:06:51,891
Yeah, I'd just lie down.

122
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,593
But if you want
to see a real marvel,

123
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,328
Kaylee is going to play
Jim at Guitar Hero

124
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,096
and Kaylee is gonna
be blindfolded.

125
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:59,065
- You should come watch.
- I will.

126
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,201
Look at this.
It's from Mike Tapley.

127
00:07:03,236 --> 00:07:05,271
"I'm available. Call me."

128
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,373
That's how you ask someone out?

129
00:07:07,407 --> 00:07:09,074
"I'm available. Call me."

130
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,876
What time do you have?

131
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,246
8:25.

132
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:30,052
Ooh, boo, I just buzzed.
Can you check my phone? It's in my back pocket.

133
00:07:30,086 --> 00:07:32,087
It might be Jim's mom
begging me to stop.

134
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:34,055
I can play an actual guitar.

135
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,090
All you have to do is declare
my supremacy and I'll stop.

136
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,758
It's your incoming Twitter feeds.

137
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:40,328
Oh, read them to me.
And someone tell me if Jim's holding back tears.

138
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:44,098
Someone named Monster has a link
to some epic photographs.

139
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:48,269
- Steve Martin says, "I like my antiques new."
- Funny.

140
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:51,305
And the Rock's tweeting,
"Just got word that will shock the world.

141
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,041
Land of the free, home of the brave.
Damn proud to be an American."

142
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,076
<i>Guess </i>Fast Five
<i>just won the weekend.</i>

143
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,212
No, that means
he's coming back.

144
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:02,515
The Rock is coming back to lay
the smack down on Triple H.

145
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:06,452
Stop playing.
You lost like 10 minutes ago.

146
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,692
Hey.

147
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,761
Somebody said you were in here
working on a Sunday night

148
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:18,364
during a party and
I had no trouble believing it.

149
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,399
I was just securing
the video overnights.

150
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,033
It's okay.

151
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,603
It's weird how
the video overnights

152
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:27,339
look so much like
the Mets-Phillies game.

153
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,474
Isn't it?

154
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,909
- It's Lisa. You should take it.
- It's okay.

155
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,012
She's supposed to be here.
Maybe something happened.

156
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,847
I'm sure she's just
blowing up her hair.

157
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,815
- Blowing out her hair?
- Is that what it is?

158
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,649
Yeah.
Take the call.

159
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,018
I think she's gone.

160
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:43,187
Hi, Lis'.

161
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:44,654
Hey, did I call
the wrong computer?

162
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,323
<i>No, your man is right here.</i>

163
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,858
- He was just watching some porn.
- Nope.

164
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:49,625
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Five minutes away.

165
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,861
I'm walking. I've got FaceTime on my phone.
Can you see me?

166
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,997
You should be looking in front of you
while you're walking or you're gonna--

167
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,465
- What? I'm-- Oof!
- <i>Whoa, sorry.</i>

168
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,600
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>- No worries. No worries.</i>

169
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,469
- Okay, have a good night.
- You okay?

170
00:08:59,503 --> 00:09:02,638
Yeah, I walked into a pedestrian
who also has FaceTime on his phone.

171
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:03,939
Please don't cross any streets.

172
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:05,974
I was gonna call you and then
I saw you were online.

173
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:07,876
- <i>Aren't I coming to a party?</i>
- Absolutely.

174
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,145
- I just needed to do some work.
- Watch some porn.

175
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,080
- Mets-Phillies?
<i>- Only to check the score.</i>

176
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,416
Hey, check it out.
I've got a new expression I want to try.

177
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,984
You ready?
It's a gas.

178
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,386
- I like it.
- Try it.

179
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,121
- It's a gas.
- Nope. Terrible.

180
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:20,621
You can't do it.
I'm almost there.

181
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,223
- It'll be a gas.
- Seriously, no.

182
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:24,625
- All right.
- All right, I'll be there in a minute.

183
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,828
- I love you.
- And I do, too.

184
00:09:33,902 --> 00:09:36,503
Yeah, maybe if you stare at
that piece of paper long enough,

185
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:38,271
the time will reverse itself

186
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,373
and the last 10 seconds will
be erased from the universe.

187
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:42,975
All right, first of all,
can we agree

188
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:46,812
that sometimes being this connected
by technology does more harm--

189
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:49,049
I love you and I do, too?

190
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,484
Here's what happened.
Lisa told me she loved me last night.

191
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,818
- She did?
- Yes.

192
00:09:53,853 --> 00:09:56,555
- She does that too early.
- I completely agree.

193
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:59,525
Save your agreement 'cause I don't think
we're gonna be on the same side on this one.

194
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,892
How do you feel about that?

195
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:03,362
Her? How do you feel about her?

196
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:05,197
- I don't feel the same way.
- You don't?

197
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,999
I like her.
She's really nice

198
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:11,202
and really funny
and incredibly sexy.

199
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,305
Really very sexy with
the sexiness that--

200
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,707
- I get it.
- And I like the new expression.

201
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,643
- It's a gas.
- Don't even.

202
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:21,145
- But I don't love her.
<i>- You don't?</i>

203
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,313
No.

204
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:25,030
So what did you say when she said,
"I love you"?

205
00:10:25,044 --> 00:10:27,413
- I said, "I love you, too."
- Of course you did.

206
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:30,849
- Anything else seemed rude.
- And then you just told her again.

207
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,251
No, what I said was,
"And I do, too."

208
00:10:33,286 --> 00:10:35,020
Which means that I love me.

209
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:38,424
And I do. I look in the mirror
and I like what I see.

210
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:41,826
I've been on a journey of self-discovery
to answer the question who is Jim Harper--

211
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,428
- Shut up.
- Okay.

212
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:46,297
You can't keep telling her
you love her if you don't.

213
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:49,266
Which is why, frankly,
I would have preferred not to take the call.

214
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,368
You think blaming me is gonna
be a winning strategy?

215
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:53,704
- No.
- What are you gonna do now?

216
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:55,139
Well, obviously I have
to leave the country.

217
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:57,707
- You have to break up with her.
- Why?

218
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:59,676
You can't have a relationship

219
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:03,947
where one person's here
and the other person's there.

220
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:05,949
Really?
Where's Don?

221
00:11:05,983 --> 00:11:07,651
Don's on a plane back from DC

222
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:10,349
- and was that a dig wrapped in a metaphor?
- No.

223
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:12,856
- I think it was a dig wrapped in a metaphor.
- I have to break up with her?

224
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,441
Yes.

225
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,359
You don't think that's going to come
as a surprise after I told her I loved her?

226
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,563
I do, yes.
I think it'll be a surprise.

227
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,831
I'll write her a nice letter.

228
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:23,332
- No!
- Everybody likes getting mail.

229
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:26,168
You're not overseas
fighting World War I.

230
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,337
You have to do it in person
and you have to do tonight.

231
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:30,104
- In the middle of a party?
- No.

232
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:32,340
When she gets here,
you'll tell her you'd like to take a walk.

233
00:11:32,374 --> 00:11:34,175
Hang on.

234
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:36,344
- And she's not that sexy.
- Yeah, she is.

235
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:38,646
Just because of her sweet face?

236
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:40,748
Yeah, that's it.

237
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,484
- I think--
<i>- It's from Mike Tapley.</i>

238
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:44,785
"I'm available. Call me."

239
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:46,553
Why would Tapley
want me to call him?

240
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,390
I mean, I get that she has
physical attributes that are prized by--

241
00:11:50,424 --> 00:11:53,527
Hey. Tapley?
Our own National Security analyst.

242
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,463
Stay here and look around and
find out what he's talking about.

243
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:59,466
- Where do I start?
- Start by emailing him back

244
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,166
and asking,
"What are you talking about?"

245
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:03,268
Do not take a tone with me,
<i>American Gigolo</i>.

246
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,571
I wasn't tak--

247
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,343
- Hey, listen.
- Sing more.

248
00:12:11,378 --> 00:12:13,713
No, I just got a strange email
from Mike Tapley.

249
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:16,315
- So did I.
- It said, "I'm available. Call me."

250
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,917
Why is he hitting on both of us?

251
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:23,889
He's not hitting on either one of you.

252
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,391
He's saying he's available
to go on the air.

253
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:28,026
- For what?
- When?

254
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,662
- Now.
- What are you talking about?

255
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,163
Wait for it.

256
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:45,242
- "Get to work."
- Who's it from?

257
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:46,844
The White House.
What does yours say?

258
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:50,346
"POTUS to address
the country at 10:30 EST

259
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,182
on matter of national security."

260
00:12:54,618 --> 00:12:56,118
Hang on.

261
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:00,456
- It's Kaylee, right?
- What's wrong?

262
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,560
The Rock,
he has a cousin who's a Navy SEAL?

263
00:13:03,594 --> 00:13:06,394
- Yeah.
- And tell me what his tweet said.

264
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:07,963
Um...

265
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,868
"Just got word that will
shock the world.

266
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:15,938
Land of the free, home of the brave.
Damn proud to be an American."

267
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,239
- He's coming back to avenge Triple H.
- No, he's not.

268
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:20,875
Everybody, quiet down.

269
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,911
Will, turn off the music.

270
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:25,312
Turn it off.

271
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,616
Martin, throw me the remote.
It's right next to you.

272
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,721
You're fine.

273
00:13:33,755 --> 00:13:36,423
Martin, throw me the remote.
It's right next to you.

274
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:41,327
<i>The president's speaking
in 90 minutes on a matter</i>

275
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,797
of national security.
That's all we know right now.

276
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:48,267
30 minutes from now,
I want to know a lot more than that.

277
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:51,104
Four people to a cab.
Let's go.

278
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:52,572
<i>What do you think it is?</i>

279
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,339
<i>It could be Gaddafi.
It could be Iran.</i>

280
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,808
They could have fired
on a ship in the Gulf.

281
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,676
Jimmy Carter just got
back from North Korea.

282
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,145
He could have learned something.
We could be under attack.

283
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:02,447
But what do you think it is?

284
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,650
I think we got bin Laden.

285
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:08,320
- How many people does your lift hold?
- What?

286
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,021
Your elevator,
how many people can it hold?

287
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:11,856
- Six.
- Call down to the doorman.

288
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,858
- Just up and down, no stops.
- Yeah. Lonny!

289
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:16,694
I'm bringing the car around.
You stand in the lobby.

290
00:14:16,729 --> 00:14:18,529
- Do not go out on the sidewalk.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

291
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,265
Guys, get Lonny in the elevator.

292
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,501
- Right.
- What is going on?

293
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:25,702
There's breaking news
and we don't know what it is,

294
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:27,504
but the president's
gonna go on TV at 10:30.

295
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,139
- You don't know what it is?
- No.

296
00:14:29,173 --> 00:14:30,674
Can I come watch?
I'll sit in the corner.

297
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,308
Sure. Yeah.
But once you're there,

298
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,111
you can't leave and you can't
communicate with anyone.

299
00:14:34,145 --> 00:14:35,879
Okay.
What do you think is going on?

300
00:14:35,913 --> 00:14:37,914
We don't know.
But I have to be honest,

301
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:40,216
it can only be very good
or very bad.

302
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:46,022
It's almost, I don't know.
It's almost--

303
00:14:46,056 --> 00:14:47,589
- Like she's trying too hard.
- Yeah.

304
00:14:47,624 --> 00:14:49,992
Like she's trying too hard to
show you everything's fine.

305
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,194
It's almost like that.
It's right near being like that.

306
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:53,362
What are you guys
talking about?

307
00:14:53,396 --> 00:14:55,031
- Don thinks that Maggie...
- Too loud.

308
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,032
- is trying too hard to create the appearance...
- Way too loud.

309
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,599
- ...that she's happy in their relationship.
- Full plane. Man right here.

310
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:00,635
You've been yammering about
your love life for two weeks.

311
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,436
- Wow, also bizarrely loud.
<i>- Including last night's Correspondents' Dinner.</i>

312
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:05,506
I'm a financial news reporter and
the Secretary of the Treasury

313
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,575
turned around and said,
"When's he gonna shut up about Maggie?"

314
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:09,110
<i>That was really
embarrassing for me</i>

315
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:10,979
and it came right after
I accidentally set him on fire.

316
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:12,713
Hey, don't turn on your phones yet.

317
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:14,915
- <i>We haven't touched the ground.</i>
- I turn mine on at 500 feet.

318
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,616
I turn mine on when I see
someone else turn theirs on.

319
00:15:16,651 --> 00:15:18,218
It messes with the navigation.

320
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,586
The runway is right
in front of him.

321
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,288
Do you use your car's
navigation system

322
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,890
to get from your driveway
to your garage?

323
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:24,825
I don't have a driveway,
a garage, or a car,

324
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:26,493
but why don't we assume
the pilot knows--

325
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:28,395
Hey, sir, can you
take his phone away?

326
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,763
<i>He's endangering your life and
the lives of the other passengers.</i>

327
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:34,033
I'm not. I'm not.
She set the Treasury Secretary on fire.

328
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,003
- It's true.
- Why?

329
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,939
Just to show the other
cabinet secretaries that I could.

330
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,111
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to New York's LaGuardia Airport

331
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,814
where the current time is
seven minutes past 9:00.

332
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:50,982
- <i>We ask that you...</i>
- You okay now?

333
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,650
Or are you worried
he can't find the airport from here?

334
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,052
I'm all about safety.

335
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,754
Yeah, I'm sure if we
went to the burn unit,

336
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,023
Timothy Geithner would say that--
Damn it.

337
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,192
My phone was on the whole time.
It's out of juice.

338
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,859
Could you guys scroll
through your messages

339
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,427
and see if there's
anything I need to know?

340
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:06,330
It's my daughter.
"Daddy, are you the smartest man in the world?"

341
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,099
- Yes.
- Scroll.

342
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,335
"Miss Sabbith,
a lady always buttons her top button.

343
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,771
If you buttoned your collar on television,
you would be a lady.

344
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:17,173
If you spilled water all over your front,
I would like that, too."

345
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,343
It's a fan.

346
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:22,746
- Scroll, scroll.
- Shit.

347
00:16:23,614 --> 00:16:24,814
Jesus.

348
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,751
Hey, do you have this?

349
00:16:29,386 --> 00:16:31,454
Excuse me, would you mind just
switching seats with that woman?

350
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:34,456
- We're almost at the gate.
- I know it sounds crazy, but would you do it for me?

351
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,424
Well, can I get your number?

352
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:38,060
- No.
- Sure. I will give you her number.

353
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,062
- If you'd just give me a chance--
- How old are you?

354
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:43,132
- I'm old enough.
- I will give you a chance.

355
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:47,369
Your first test is will you switch seats
without asking for anything in return?

356
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:50,071
- Yes.
- <i>Excuse me.</i>

357
00:16:50,105 --> 00:16:52,273
You have to stay seated
until we're at the gate.

358
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:53,975
- Points for trying?
- Throw me your phone.

359
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,643
- You think they're still at the party?
- Not anymore.

360
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:57,211
Guys, wait till
we're off the plane.

361
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,512
There's just too much
we don't know

362
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:00,381
and too many words
we don't want to say out loud.

363
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,883
- What's going on?
- See?

364
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,684
No, I mean the plane's stopping.

365
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:06,286
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.</i>

366
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,721
<i>Well, no good deed
goes unpunished.</i>

367
00:17:08,756 --> 00:17:12,325
<i>We arrived 10 minutes early and ground
traffic control doesn't have a gate for us.</i>

368
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,027
No, no, no.

369
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:16,029
<i>It'll be just a few minutes and
then we'll have you on your way.</i>

370
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,864
All right, you guys
mind switching seats now?

371
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:20,366
Remember, I've already proven
myself with the first test.

372
00:17:20,401 --> 00:17:22,034
Excuse me.

373
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24,303
- You have to stay seated.
- But we're stopped.

374
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:26,571
We're still on the taxiway.

375
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,809
You have to stay seated until the captain
turns off the seat belt sign.

376
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,610
Ma'am, this is a bit
of an emergency.

377
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,946
Sir, FAA rules require
passengers to stay seated...

378
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,115
- Sure.
- ...with their seat belts fastened

379
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,782
until we're safely at
the gate and the captain...

380
00:17:37,817 --> 00:17:39,818
- Got it.
- ...has turned off the seat belt sign.

381
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,054
It's not just for your safety.
You could fall into one of the other passengers.

382
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,755
- <i>Understood, ma'am.</i>
- Please don't make me tell you again.

383
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,226
If I can just say this:
We're stopped. Right?

384
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,361
<i>And the pilot just said
that it would be a few minutes.</i>

385
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:53,430
Now, if the plane does start moving
while my colleague and...

386
00:17:53,464 --> 00:17:55,899
- Lester.
- ...Lester are changing seats,

387
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,534
it'll be going two miles an hour.

388
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:00,938
<i>Up there, you let us stand and move around
and we were going like 550.</i>

389
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:04,208
So I thought maybe
we could apply logic

390
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,076
and see where that took us.

391
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,378
Insulting me is not
gonna help you out much.

392
00:18:08,412 --> 00:18:10,779
- I wasn't insulting you.
- I can't get anybody to answer their phone.

393
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,048
You're calling people
who are on the subway.

394
00:18:12,082 --> 00:18:13,249
Call people who are in taxis.

395
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,683
You have to let us
off this plane.

396
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,019
I'm not letting you
unbuckle your seat belt.

397
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,721
You think I'm
letting you off the plane?

398
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,891
If you know what we know--
which is nothing--

399
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:24,926
you'd be behind us
and they'd be behind us

400
00:18:24,961 --> 00:18:26,527
and I think later on tonight
you're gonna be saying,

401
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,529
"I wish I'd been more cooperative
with that passenger."

402
00:18:28,564 --> 00:18:30,866
I think later on tonight
you're gonna be saying,

403
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,534
"These handcuffs hurt my wrists."

404
00:18:33,569 --> 00:18:36,238
All right, she's not easy.
I need information now.

405
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:38,006
If they knew more,
they'd be telling us, right?

406
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,441
We'll keep calling the desk,
but I think we're just gonna have to wait.

407
00:18:40,476 --> 00:18:43,710
Waiting, patience--
Words like that, always my last option.

408
00:18:43,745 --> 00:18:45,812
Borrow somebody's phone
and start dialing.

409
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,215
Lester.

410
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,418
<i>Andy, listen,
most of my staff are kids.</i>

411
00:18:52,452 --> 00:18:54,820
Five years ago, half of them were
editing their college newspapers.

412
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,822
- <i>Will, we can't--</i>
- You just got to give me a little guidance.

413
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:58,824
We think it's bin Laden.
If we're wrong, just wave me off.

414
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,559
<i>I can't do any waving.</i>

415
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:02,495
All right, we're gonna do a Carl Bernstein
from <i>All the President's Men</i>.

416
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,964
I'm gonna say it's bin Laden
and I'm gonna count to 10.

417
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,100
If you don't say anything,
that's what we're pursuing.

418
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:11,069
Ready? One...

419
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,338
Two...

420
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,375
Wait a second.
That's where they fucked up in the movie.

421
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:18,176
- <i>I've got to go, man.</i>
- No, he didn't--

422
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,078
The guy misunderstood
the directions.

423
00:19:20,113 --> 00:19:21,879
Andy?

424
00:19:24,449 --> 00:19:25,749
<i>We're not moving.</i>

425
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:28,152
- There's construction.
- On a Sunday night?

426
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,754
They do it on Sunday night so they
don't inconvenience people.

427
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:33,190
This is gonna be a great city
once they finish building it.

428
00:19:33,225 --> 00:19:35,226
Just sit tight.

429
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,860
What are we, 22 blocks away?

430
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,694
I'm gonna get you there.

431
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:41,664
I'm gonna run.

432
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:43,566
- No, you're not.
- I can run fast.

433
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,668
You can't get out of
the car without me.

434
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,408
I see you thinking about it.

435
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:53,342
Do not do it.

436
00:19:56,913 --> 00:19:59,581
What are you putting
that in your pocket for?

437
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,019
Motherfucker!

438
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:11,625
Get back here!
You are not safe out here!

439
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,495
McAvoy, get back!
God damn it.

440
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,131
- Sir, is there a problem?
- There's a guy running west.

441
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,933
- He's gonna go north on 5th.
- Just calm down.

442
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,468
I'm calm, Officer.
But that man cannot--

443
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:22,903
- Please step back in your vehicle.
- The keys are inside.

444
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:24,505
Could you just move it
over to the side?

445
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,340
- I'm private security.
- Calm down and step back.

446
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:28,275
- Please, listen to me.
- Turn around and place your hands on the car.

447
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:31,345
- Officer.
- Turn around and place your hands on the car.

448
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,313
- I'm gonna kill him.
- What was that?

449
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:36,850
- Officers, I'm armed.
- He said he's armed.

450
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:39,319
- Put your hands on the car.
- I'm licensed to carry.

451
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,753
And there's a weapon
currently on your person?

452
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,821
Under my jacket
on my left side.

453
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:44,290
It's loaded with the safety on.

454
00:20:44,324 --> 00:20:46,359
My carry permit's in
my back right pocket.

455
00:20:46,393 --> 00:20:49,128
I work for Blue North Security and
my client is at large.

456
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:52,764
You're a big guy, okay?
Don't do anything that's gonna make us nervous.

457
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,402
Nothing I can do about being big and
black at the same time.

458
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:01,606
You guys,
you can sit anywhere over here.

459
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,243
The kitchen is back there with...

460
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,546
- with, uh...
- Pop-Tarts.

461
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,081
Why did you choose Pop-Tarts?

462
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:12,850
I don't know, but you were never
gonna finish that sentence.

463
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,385
Just sit tight.
And remember,

464
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,454
you're not gonna hear.
Please and thank you a lot.

465
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,923
How long does it take
to get the studio warmed up?

466
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:22,726
15 minutes. And the control room
is warming up right now.

467
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,361
You talking to DC?

468
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:25,662
They'll start rolling
coverage in 20 minutes.

469
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:27,531
- Of what?
- A live shot of the White House.

470
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:29,999
Let them know New York's running this
and they don't say a word

471
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:32,368
- until Charlie says okay.
- Any idea when we're breaking?

472
00:21:32,403 --> 00:21:33,969
President speaks in 45 minutes.

473
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:36,072
If we know something
before then, we'll go.

474
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,845
Gary.
Have you tried Gary?

475
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,414
Quiet. Quiet!

476
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,184
Let's get organized.

477
00:21:49,218 --> 00:21:52,287
What exactly do we know?
And I mean know.

478
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:55,023
The president is speaking at 10:30
on a matter of national security.

479
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,425
- What else?
- That's it.

480
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,560
Okay, that's exactly
what we knew 20 minutes ago.

481
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:01,795
Just to be clear,
he's breaking into the networks, too.

482
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:04,932
That's <i>Desperate Housewives</i>,
<i>Celebrity Apprentice</i>, <i>Brothers and Sisters</i>.

483
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,700
That's a ton of money
in ad givebacks.

484
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,969
- This can't wait till the morning.
- It's bin Laden, Mac.

485
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,604
We want it to be bin Laden.

486
00:22:10,638 --> 00:22:12,739
Let's not let the wish
be the father of the thought.

487
00:22:12,774 --> 00:22:14,841
Obviously we're
pursuing bin Laden.

488
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,577
But let's just talk about
what else it could be.

489
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:19,345
- Gaddafi.
- Follow it. Put together a team out there.

490
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,846
A foreign attack.

491
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,848
No one at State or DOD is talking, right?

492
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,318
If they're not clamming up,
they honestly don't know anything.

493
00:22:25,352 --> 00:22:28,721
Who did the Santa Tracker story at Christmas?
Anyone?

494
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,324
When we get the guy from NORAD
on the phone, they report

495
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,292
they're tracking
a big sled with reindeer.

496
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:35,527
- I did.
- Get him on the phone.

497
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,464
You think the Santa guy
is gonna know something?

498
00:22:38,498 --> 00:22:40,932
I'd be pretty surprised,
but I'm not doing nothing.

499
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:44,203
What about outside the box?
Way, way outside the box?

500
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,171
- Ahem, all right. Here I go.
<i>- What?</i>

501
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,240
A study published in the
<i>Astrophysical Journal</i> estimates

502
00:22:49,274 --> 00:22:52,410
there are 10 trillion planetary systems
in the known universe.

503
00:22:52,444 --> 00:22:54,812
- Which one are you from?
- She said outside the box.

504
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:58,649
Then she added way,
way outside the box.

505
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:01,952
Besides the near certainty that intelligent life
exists outside this planet--

506
00:23:01,987 --> 00:23:05,655
Are you suggesting that we've made contact
with beings from another planet?

507
00:23:05,689 --> 00:23:07,424
<i>Is that your suggestion?</i>

508
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,660
- You said way outside the box.
- Come back in the box.

509
00:23:10,694 --> 00:23:12,596
- The birth certificate.
<i>- What about it?</i>

510
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,165
What if the long form's a forgery and
the president's resigning?

511
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:18,668
I think it's more likely ET is standing
on the Truman Balcony.

512
00:23:18,702 --> 00:23:20,670
- So should I follow--
- No.

513
00:23:20,704 --> 00:23:22,505
Where's Will?

514
00:23:24,007 --> 00:23:25,807
<i>Okay, where's Elliot?</i>

515
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,177
Elliot, Sloan, and Don--

516
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:31,614
We're able to communicate with them,
but they're stuck on the tarmac at LaGuardia.

517
00:23:31,648 --> 00:23:35,451
All right, Maggie, dust off the obit
packages for bin Laden.

518
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,019
- <i>Tess, you're on Gaddafi.</i>
- Okay.

519
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,086
<i>Jim, do what you do
and get us new information</i>

520
00:23:39,121 --> 00:23:41,289
and get the bookers to line up
our National Security guys.

521
00:23:41,323 --> 00:23:43,924
You can start with Mike Tapley,
who's available.

522
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,027
Let's go.

523
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,167
What?

524
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:54,868
The president's gonna tell us
what's going on at 10:30.

525
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:57,204
He's going to tell us.
What's the virtue

526
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:59,506
of breaking it
five minutes early?

527
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,242
America thinks bin Laden's alive.

528
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,279
If I can make him dead
one minute sooner,

529
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:09,149
my entire life in journalism up until this
point will have been worth it.

530
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:11,584
All right.

531
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,521
I got a White House usher
who says they're bringing

532
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:17,456
a backup generator
into the East Room.

533
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,325
Mac, he's speaking
from the East Room.

534
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,026
Presidents don't announce
bad news from the East Room.

535
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:22,961
They do it from the Oval Office
or the Briefing Room.

536
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,397
<i>All right, good.
Listen...</i>

537
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,233
<i>You don't think there's any
chance it's a UFO, do you?</i>

538
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,002
Keep it together, would you?

539
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,375
- She's in the bathroom.
- Thanks.

540
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,814
- What do you have?
- What, is this your boyfriend?

541
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:45,349
- Yes.
- No. Yes.

542
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,185
Look, I'm not the kind of guy
that likes to play games.

543
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,854
- He's with Maggie.
- Thanks, Pete.

544
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:53,123
- What'd you find?
- According to FlyersRights.org,

545
00:24:53,157 --> 00:24:55,426
we can download a petition demanding
we be allowed off the plane,

546
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,227
but it's not clear how
many signatures we need.

547
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,095
We don't have time to circulate a petition.
What else you got?

548
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:01,231
A website that lists seven ways
to get kicked off a plane,

549
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:03,799
- including shouting loud, unpopular political views.
- I can do that.

550
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:05,868
<i>Being dressed in an inappropriately
revealing manner.</i>

551
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,770
- Take off your clothes.
- You take off your clothes.

552
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:09,339
I guess I'm stuck
with the tiebreaker.

553
00:25:09,373 --> 00:25:11,974
Lester, I'm gonna
lose my shit on you.

554
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:17,812
- Generator in the East Room.
- It's not bad news.

555
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,449
Uh, Elliot, let's try--

556
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:27,822
Boy, that Genghis Khan
had some pretty good ideas.

557
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:29,724
- You see what happened?
- Yes.

558
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:31,692
The worst thing that
could possibly happen.

559
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:33,894
I fell down and guess what,
nobody died.

560
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:36,497
Get in your seat,
fasten your seat belt.

561
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,266
Sure, but I might need to see
that demonstration again

562
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,101
'cause I've never seen
a seat belt before.

563
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,409
He's stopping.

564
00:25:49,443 --> 00:25:51,978
The gate's right there.
It's right out the window.

565
00:25:52,012 --> 00:25:54,614
I can see it.
I'm practically touching it right now.

566
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:56,149
- Take it easy.
- It's right there!

567
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:57,884
<i>Well, folks,
this is the captain.</i>

568
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:00,287
- <i>Good news-- Our gate has opened up.</i>
- Thank you.

569
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,954
- <i>But this is a tow-in gate.</i>
- No!

570
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:05,223
<i>So it'll be just
a few more minutes.</i>

571
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:07,225
Let me out!
Let me out

572
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,728
and I will push the plane
to the gate.

573
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,731
Maggie's a lucky girl.

574
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:17,868
No one's asked us to switch over to
the Emergency Broadcasting System,

575
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:20,838
so there isn't a North Korean missile
headed towards San Diego.

576
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,807
<i>No one knows anything
at the CDC,</i>

577
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,176
so a vial of smallpox
hasn't been dropped

578
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,312
in the middle of
Madison Square Garden.

579
00:26:27,346 --> 00:26:29,814
We have a computer that monitors
all the police scanners

580
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,449
and listens for certain words.

581
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:33,917
<i>There's been no act
of domestic terrorism,</i>

582
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:36,520
though there is a frat party
at Michigan State

583
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,355
that's about to get broken up.

584
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,357
You guys know it's bin Laden,
don't you?

585
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:43,293
Believe me, when we know
it's bin Laden, you'll know.

586
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,662
I'd have expected it
to be a lot more chaotic.

587
00:26:45,697 --> 00:26:47,297
Since the first day
Mackenzie got here,

588
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,565
we've been practicing this once a month.
We do dry runs.

589
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,034
Obviously there are always
wild cards you can't predict.

590
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,203
Hey, little buddy.

591
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,171
- Oh, boy.
- Are you all right?

592
00:26:56,206 --> 00:26:57,873
- Yeah.
- Mac's been worried.

593
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,943
We got stuck in some traffic,
so I ran here.

594
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:02,778
We've been calling.

595
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,347
I thought it would be better to
keep running than answer the phone.

596
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:07,114
What's that?

597
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:09,116
I stopped to get a falafel.

598
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,052
I'm just gonna...

599
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:15,724
Good. Thanks.
Anything new?

600
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,360
<i>It's bin Laden or Gaddafi.</i>

601
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:20,595
And the White House pushed
it 15 minutes to 10:45.

602
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:23,697
God. Have you ever noticed

603
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:27,067
how we've never been able to agree on
a way to spell Gaddafi?

604
00:27:27,101 --> 00:27:29,770
"Q-A," "K-A," "G."

605
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:30,904
Will, are you able to--

606
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,840
Gaddafi would have been
a NATO operation.

607
00:27:32,874 --> 00:27:34,475
I've spoken with Wesley Clark,

608
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:37,543
who called NATO HQ in Brussels.
They don't know anything.

609
00:27:37,578 --> 00:27:40,346
You've already spoken
to NATO HQ?

610
00:27:40,381 --> 00:27:43,215
When I was getting the falafel.

611
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:47,086
Kaylee.

612
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,390
I need to be able to count
on your discretion.

613
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:53,058
You can't imagine
how important this night is.

614
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:57,863
You're gonna be great.

615
00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:00,231
Just keep drinking water.

616
00:28:00,266 --> 00:28:02,634
All right.

617
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:07,305
So I'm gonna go
in my office and...

618
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:09,707
take it from there.

619
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:13,343
So if it's not Gaddafi,
doesn't that mean--

620
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:16,514
Like I said, when we have it confirmed,
you'll know it.

621
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:21,419
- Go back to work.
- Yeah.

622
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:23,888
<i>You can see the Press
Briefing Room is empty.</i>

623
00:28:23,922 --> 00:28:26,923
The White House Press Corps is
starting to arrive on the scene,

624
00:28:26,957 --> 00:28:28,391
but they're staking out positions

625
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,827
near the northwest
executive entrance.

626
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:34,096
- Mac, can you hear me?
- Yup.

627
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,932
<i>Keith Urbahn,
who's the Chief of Staff</i>

628
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,200
<i>for Donald Rumsfeld,
has tweeted the following:</i>

629
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:39,969
"So I'm told by a reputable person

630
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:42,337
they have killed Osama bin Laden.
Hot damn."

631
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:44,506
- We got the tweet.
- We want to report it.

632
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:47,075
- <i>You can't do it.</i>
- We're not gonna say confirmed.

633
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,510
We just want to report the tweet.

634
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:50,244
Jane, this is double
confirmation territory,

635
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:52,680
- and we don't even have one yet.
- The tweet is reportable.

636
00:28:52,714 --> 00:28:54,281
Do you know how many tweets
there are out there?

637
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,351
Just one from the Chief of Staff
to the former Secretary of Defense.

638
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,286
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to keep vamping.

639
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:01,889
We've got a package on past live addresses
from the East Room.

640
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:04,659
- We'll shoot it to you.
- Mac, we're eight blocks from the White House.

641
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:07,461
- We'd like to report some news.
- Then go get some, Jane.

642
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,262
Will's here.

643
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:11,865
- Mac?
- Back to you, Jane.

644
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:16,402
The president was scheduled
to address the nation at 10:30.

645
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:19,372
But we have been told it
will be closer to 10:45.

646
00:29:19,406 --> 00:29:21,941
If you're just joining us,
I'll recap everything

647
00:29:21,975 --> 00:29:24,710
we're able to report.
It shouldn't take long.

648
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,782
Thank God.
Where have you been?

649
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:31,851
There was construction.
I have to get on the air.

650
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,619
- What do you want to say?
- It's not Gaddafi.

651
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:35,087
We've got NATO
saying it's not Libya.

652
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:37,322
And we've got London and Paris
saying it's not Gaddafi.

653
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:39,323
- It's not Gaddafi.
- So who's saying it is?

654
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,394
Continuing what we have
assumed that Gaddafi--

655
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:45,597
It has something to do
with Gaddafi.

656
00:29:45,631 --> 00:29:48,432
Do you agree with the general
that the war in Libya

657
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,068
will continue or do you think
that the death of Gaddafi--

658
00:29:51,103 --> 00:29:52,470
Jesus Christ.

659
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:53,770
Let them know
New York is ready.

660
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:55,706
I'm just gonna go on,
say it's not Libya,

661
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,340
and then throw it
back to Washington

662
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,842
- until we have a double confirmation.
- Good.

663
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,811
Okay, so let's let them
know New York is ready.

664
00:30:00,845 --> 00:30:02,546
I'm just gonna go on,
say it's not Libya,

665
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,682
and then throw it back to Washington
until we have double confirmation.

666
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,851
- You just said that.
- Hmm?

667
00:30:07,886 --> 00:30:09,386
You all right?

668
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,588
I just think this
is some kind of trick tie.

669
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:14,356
- I can't get it to--
- What's the problem?

670
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:17,426
I can't remember
how to tie a Windsor knot.

671
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,295
I can tie a square knot
and a sheep-shank.

672
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,799
- Will?
- But that's not useful right now.

673
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:26,134
What is wrong with you?

674
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:29,170
I'm wasted, okay?

675
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,305
- I'm completely baked.
- What?

676
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,542
- I had-- Okay, listen.
- Oh, no.

677
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:35,243
- No, no, it's okay.
- Oh, my God.

678
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,178
Listen, Neal's girlfriend--
and you should see her,

679
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:39,014
she can play
Guitar Hero blindfolded.

680
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:41,149
- Oh, my God.
- No, you're right. It doesn't matter.

681
00:30:41,183 --> 00:30:43,116
Let me back it up.
When you're pitching,

682
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,452
you have your push-off leg
and your landing leg.

683
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,120
That landing leg,
as you can see,

684
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:49,690
takes a lot of force when you
come down on it like that.

685
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,992
Boom. Like that.
And marijuana--

686
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:54,227
This isn't happening.
You can't do this.

687
00:30:54,262 --> 00:30:56,129
- I'm a medical marvel.
- You can't go on the air.

688
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,397
My body has the
melatolical tolerance--

689
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,533
- Metabolical.
- What did I say?

690
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,068
- Will!
- Mackenzie, listen to me.

691
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:05,071
There is no way--
No way

692
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,140
I'm not reporting this story.

693
00:31:11,712 --> 00:31:14,479
You understand, right?

694
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,550
Of course.

695
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,086
I'm not gonna let you down.

696
00:31:22,956 --> 00:31:24,790
I know.

697
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,795
Hey, we got Obama.

698
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:32,763
Bin Laden.

699
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,199
I got that one out of my system.

700
00:31:36,434 --> 00:31:37,868
Let's think of the people
who would know.

701
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,336
- Well, POTUS.
- V-POTUS.

702
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,205
- Head of JSOC.
- Bill McRaven.

703
00:31:41,239 --> 00:31:42,506
- Gates.
- Panetta.

704
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,009
- Guys.
- It was either Delta, SEAL Six,

705
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:46,743
- <i>or a bullet from the CIA.</i>
- Guys.

706
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:48,845
- What about a drone?
- I don't think they'd use a drone.

707
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,513
They'd want
an immediate positive ID.

708
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,582
Guys!

709
00:31:52,617 --> 00:31:55,952
What does EKIA mean?

710
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:00,790
It means "enemy killed in action."

711
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:03,826
I have the first confirmation.

712
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,128
<i>With the White House
now telling us</i>

713
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:08,196
that the president's address
has been pushed back

714
00:32:08,231 --> 00:32:10,599
another 15 minutes to 11:00.

715
00:32:10,634 --> 00:32:13,335
You will know everything we know
as we know it.

716
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,004
And in the meantime,
let's go back

717
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:17,472
to Jane Barrow in Washington.
Jane.

718
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,508
Don just called.
We got the first confirmation.

719
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:22,576
- From who?
- Chris Harkin at CENTCOM.

720
00:32:22,611 --> 00:32:24,245
CENTCOM in Tampa.
That's one.

721
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,480
- Mac, we got the second confirmation.
- From who?

722
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:27,882
- <i>New York Times</i>.
- You're kidding.

723
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,684
Helene Cooper just posted
she has it from two sources.

724
00:32:29,718 --> 00:32:31,485
Maggie.

725
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,154
We've got Chris Harkin
at CENTCOM

726
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:35,421
and Helene Cooper
at the <i>New York Times</i>.

727
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,961
- We got him.
- Let's go.

728
00:32:40,995 --> 00:32:43,897
- No.
- What do you mean?

729
00:32:43,931 --> 00:32:46,800
- We're not going yet.
- We've got double confirmation.

730
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:49,202
First of all, we don't.
We have Harkin at CENTCOM

731
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,737
<i>and a reporter saying
she has two sources.</i>

732
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,273
- I don't know who the sources are.
- It's Helene Cooper.

733
00:32:54,307 --> 00:32:57,009
- It's solid.
- We're not going.

734
00:32:57,044 --> 00:32:59,979
- Charlie.
- There's nothing wrong with waiting for the White House

735
00:33:00,013 --> 00:33:02,782
to tell us it's reportable.
This isn't Watergate.

736
00:33:02,816 --> 00:33:06,417
They're not the enemy.
We don't know what's going on.

737
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,888
We sent military assets
into sovereign airspace.

738
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:11,990
Maybe they're not out yet.

739
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:13,792
Maybe someone's
injured on the ground.

740
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,727
Maybe someone's
been taken prisoner

741
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,296
and the rescue operation
is underway.

742
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,832
Maybe we're at war
with Pakistan.

743
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,502
Guys, in '91,

744
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:29,039
I was cheering on
my guy in Tel Aviv

745
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,442
who was reporting where
the scud missiles were landing.

746
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:37,114
<i>Turns out the Iraqis didn't know
where the missiles were landing</i>

747
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,717
and I was helping them
range their targets.

748
00:33:44,955 --> 00:33:46,655
Three killed,

749
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,959
96 injured in that operation.

750
00:33:54,496 --> 00:33:57,265
Geraldo's probably
still up the street

751
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:00,068
saying we're in
a dogfight with Finland.

752
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:04,672
Whatever happened tonight,

753
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:07,242
I promise you,

754
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:11,445
lives and a presidency
were put on the line.

755
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:14,314
We're going to get
this one right.

756
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,583
<i>And if we're two minutes late,</i>

757
00:34:16,618 --> 00:34:21,088
let that be a small penance
for all the ones we got wrong.

758
00:34:26,693 --> 00:34:28,027
Agreed.

759
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:32,165
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

760
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:38,772
- Hmm?
- What's wrong with him?

761
00:34:38,806 --> 00:34:41,040
Nothing.

762
00:34:42,575 --> 00:34:44,109
Charlie, I do think
you should tell them.

763
00:34:45,845 --> 00:34:47,880
That I'd love to do.

764
00:34:50,616 --> 00:34:52,050
Can everybody quiet down?

765
00:34:52,085 --> 00:34:53,986
Everybody quiet down.

766
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,855
Charlie would like to
tell you something.

767
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:59,090
Um...

768
00:34:59,124 --> 00:35:01,425
I need to tell you

769
00:35:01,459 --> 00:35:03,761
that you're going
to remember this night

770
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,696
for the rest of your lives.

771
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,766
<i>It's going to be a long night
and we need you to work fast</i>

772
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:11,368
and we need you to work well.
But once in a while,

773
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:15,071
take three seconds--
You can't spare more than that--

774
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:18,341
Take three seconds to notice

775
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,177
where you are

776
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,813
and what you're doing.

777
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,216
Will's gonna go on
the air in a few minutes

778
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:29,019
so that we can report
that at the order

779
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:31,320
of the President
of the United States,

780
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:34,389
US Special Forces

781
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,859
have shot and killed
Osama bin Laden.

782
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:48,203
Get to work.

783
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:02,649
You're out here.

784
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:04,684
Neal's looking for you.

785
00:36:08,556 --> 00:36:10,958
I think word's starting
to get out we got Gaddafi.

786
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:13,393
Yeah.

787
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,763
Neal, she's out here.

788
00:36:18,131 --> 00:36:20,166
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

789
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,202
Hey.
You should be working.

790
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:25,271
I told you when we knew
for sure you'd know it.

791
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:26,839
Yeah.

792
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:29,608
I just didn't want to be
the skunk at the garden party.

793
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:32,111
- Why would you--
<i>- You're not.</i>

794
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:36,481
I was an idiot.

795
00:36:36,515 --> 00:36:39,284
I thought it would make me
feel better when it happened.

796
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,087
- Like an on-off switch.
- Of course it doesn't.

797
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:45,223
You knew someone
in one of the Towers.

798
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,227
Her father was a partner
at Cantor Fitzgerald.

799
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:53,530
We've been celebrating
around you all night.

800
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:56,767
You should.
Everybody should.

801
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,970
- You guys should get back to work.
- Nah, it's all right.

802
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:02,139
No, I want you to.

803
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:06,242
All right.
I'll be right inside.

804
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:16,386
- He wants us to wait?
- Until the White House says it's reportable.

805
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,854
- Aren't we the only ones with Harkin?
- As far as I know.

806
00:37:18,889 --> 00:37:22,291
- <i>So we are the only ones who have double confirmation?</i>
- As far as I know.

807
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,092
- We're going.
- No.

808
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:25,827
The White House just pushed the speech
another 15 minutes. We're going.

809
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:28,196
If I have to bring Charlie
in here to tell you himself,

810
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:29,864
he's gonna do it
in a different voice.

811
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,600
Washington's keeping
the audience warm for Will.

812
00:37:32,635 --> 00:37:34,269
We're getting
our facts straight.

813
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:36,271
We got bin Laden,
what do you want?

814
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:39,373
For one thing, I don't want it reported
like the Redskins won the Super Bowl.

815
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:41,242
I don't believe you people.

816
00:37:41,276 --> 00:37:44,278
We're waiting for the White House
to tell us it's reportable.

817
00:37:44,313 --> 00:37:46,647
- We're not.
- Jane. Jane!

818
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,817
- Okay, I've just received...
- Cut the fiber from Washington.

819
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,052
- It'll go black.
- Yeah.

820
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,853
- Cut the fiber.
- Copy.

821
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,797
You think she got
the message yet?

822
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:07,700
- Couple of more seconds.
- Okay.

823
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:11,136
Bring 'em back.

824
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:13,272
- Hi.
<i>- Damn it, Mac.</i>

825
00:38:13,306 --> 00:38:15,574
Move one inch
in that direction again

826
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:16,875
and you're blacked out
for the night.

827
00:38:16,909 --> 00:38:19,478
The decision to go will be made

828
00:38:19,512 --> 00:38:22,348
by the president of the news division
Charlie Skinner.

829
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:25,284
And the announcement will be
made by the face and voice

830
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:28,686
of Atlantis Cable News
Will McAvoy.

831
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:33,191
Keep an eye on her.

832
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:45,835
What are you working on?

833
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,537
Will asked me to look over
his intro copy.

834
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:49,039
Wow, that's a compliment.

835
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:51,907
I know Charlie's right,
but I wish we'd get on there.

836
00:38:51,941 --> 00:38:53,042
This is just counterintuitive.

837
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:55,044
So's Lisa being
attracted to you,

838
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:56,678
but you still have
to deal with that.

839
00:38:56,713 --> 00:38:58,180
Are you kidding?
I'm not doing it tonight.

840
00:38:58,215 --> 00:38:59,681
- You have to.
- Tonight?

841
00:38:59,716 --> 00:39:01,884
You can't sleep with her again.

842
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:04,420
Why are you sure I would?

843
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:08,990
"She is very sexy because
of her sexy sexiness

844
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:11,726
- and the very sexual sexiocity of the--"
- Fine.

845
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,828
Tell me what you're gonna say.

846
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:16,064
- I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna say.
- You need to rehearse.

847
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:17,732
- I don't need to rehearse.
- You're gonna be like <i>Spiderman</i>?

848
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:19,567
- What?
- The musical.

849
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:23,070
They didn't have enough rehearsal
and actors died, Jim.

850
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:24,538
They lost their lives.

851
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:26,673
I don't think anybody died.

852
00:39:26,707 --> 00:39:28,475
Well, they got bruised pretty bad.

853
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,911
So tell me what you're gonna say.

854
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:34,481
Lisa, you kind of took me by surprise
last night when you told--

855
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:36,050
Shh, shh, she's coming over.
Dummy up.

856
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,717
Okay. Thank God we're not
in the middle of breaking news.

857
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,186
Hey.

858
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,754
You mind if I talk
to Jim a second?

859
00:39:41,788 --> 00:39:45,191
No.
I'll be right there at my desk.

860
00:39:45,225 --> 00:39:47,093
- It's right there.
- Where?

861
00:39:47,127 --> 00:39:48,894
Right there.

862
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,297
- I'm sorry, where?
- Okay.

863
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,600
It's too bad the SEALs
are in Pakistan tonight

864
00:39:55,634 --> 00:39:58,636
because they'd be getting some mad ass
if they were in New York City.

865
00:40:04,343 --> 00:40:06,378
- Lisa, I--
- This is the worst possible time,

866
00:40:06,412 --> 00:40:09,614
but I feel ridiculous because you guys
are talking about me and I'm standing there.

867
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:11,648
No, we weren't.

868
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:14,285
- We weren't talking--
Shh.

869
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,754
Last night I said something.

870
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:19,457
I forced you to say it, too,
and that's not fair.

871
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,065
- I didn't feel forced.
- This was a fix-up that you never wanted,

872
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:25,829
and it went too far, and now I have to
let you off the hook because you're so nice

873
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:29,038
that we'd be searching for preschools
before I realized that you were just being polite.

874
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,370
I'm breaking up with you.

875
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,641
Just say okay.

876
00:40:40,744 --> 00:40:42,211
I really did like you.

877
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,546
Just say okay.

878
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:49,985
- Okay.
- Okay.

879
00:40:51,498 --> 00:40:54,923
Um, I'm gonna
go talk to spy girl.

880
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:57,359
Get to work.
That's an order.

881
00:40:57,944 --> 00:41:01,929
And thanks for
bringing me here for this.

882
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,666
- <i>Look, I--</i>
- Work.

883
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,806
What happened?

884
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,774
- I broke up with him.
- He did?

885
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,909
I mean, you did?
What?

886
00:41:18,146 --> 00:41:19,846
I saw your face when
I was talking on the phone

887
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,381
and he said, "I love you."

888
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:24,284
He said, "I do, too."
And what are you talking about?

889
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,186
I'm not doing this
to you anymore.

890
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,854
You're not doing anything to me.
I've got Don.

891
00:41:27,888 --> 00:41:29,989
- I shouldn't even be standing here.
- I'm with Don.

892
00:41:30,024 --> 00:41:33,859
- I saw your face.
- Come with me.

893
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,264
- James Tiberius Harper.
- Not my middle name.

894
00:41:38,298 --> 00:41:41,033
Lisa is-- No--
Is under the impression

895
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,169
that you broke up with her
because you have feelings for me.

896
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:44,770
I didn't break up
with her at all.

897
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:47,505
- But you were about to.
- Any reason she needed to know that?

898
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,541
- She already knew.
- This isn't at all embarrassing.

899
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:53,378
And she is under the impression that
I also have feelings for you.

900
00:41:53,412 --> 00:41:56,614
- Did you hear what killed bin Laden?
- We're in a holding pattern.

901
00:41:56,649 --> 00:42:00,251
Now, can we please state clearly,
unambiguously, and for the record

902
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:03,019
that neither of us likes the other
in any romantic context?

903
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,190
- I so state.
- As do I!

904
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,794
You guys can't begin to imagine

905
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,229
how unconvincing that was.

906
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,433
Is it all right if I stay
for the president's address?

907
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,767
Yes.

908
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,935
But we're not nearly done
talking about this yet.

909
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,438
- Maggie, I need you.
- Not nearly done.

910
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,610
I'll be over there
out of the way.

911
00:42:27,644 --> 00:42:31,046
- Wait, I--
- Just say okay.

912
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:34,249
Okay.

913
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:47,095
I'm the guy who wins the lottery
and loses the ticket.

914
00:42:47,129 --> 00:42:49,764
Biggest story in a generation
and I'm a spectator.

915
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:52,999
You are not a spectator.
We are locked on a plane

916
00:42:53,034 --> 00:42:55,202
and we still helped put it together.
That's pretty good.

917
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:57,404
What is this compulsion you have
to look on the bright side?

918
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,473
I can never count
on you to be Jewish.

919
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:03,210
If it helps, we should probably
be concerned about violent retaliation.

920
00:43:03,245 --> 00:43:05,646
That does help, man.
Thanks.

921
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,648
My regret is that I'd like to have
been with my wife for this.

922
00:43:08,682 --> 00:43:10,883
Tell her to wake up the kids,
bring them down to the studio.

923
00:43:10,917 --> 00:43:12,385
We'd all watch together.

924
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:14,287
Yes, I'd like to be
with your wife, too.

925
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,055
I'd like to be in
the newsroom with Will

926
00:43:16,089 --> 00:43:18,023
and Charlie and her and you.

927
00:43:18,058 --> 00:43:19,859
- And Maggie.
- I said Maggie.

928
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:22,094
- No, you didn't.
- You didn't.

929
00:43:22,129 --> 00:43:24,663
So you have to ask yourself
what happens

930
00:43:24,697 --> 00:43:26,965
when you and Maggie break up,
which you know is going to happen,

931
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:30,502
- <i>and Jim's with someone else.</i>
- We were talking that loud?

932
00:43:30,536 --> 00:43:32,837
Over Delaware
after the second scotch.

933
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:35,807
There's passengers in row 22
who know about you, Maggie, and Jim.

934
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:37,142
- True story.
- Shut up.

935
00:43:37,176 --> 00:43:40,177
Excuse me,
I've got a text message saying

936
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:41,879
the president is speaking
tonight in a few minutes.

937
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:43,247
Do you know
anything about this?

938
00:43:43,282 --> 00:43:45,583
The Internet says he's speaking

939
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:47,851
on a matter of grave
national security.

940
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:49,287
Yeah, I've got the same thing.

941
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:50,588
I've got a flight
that's been canceled.

942
00:43:50,622 --> 00:43:51,889
Does that have anything
to do with what--

943
00:43:51,923 --> 00:43:54,724
- Has there been a terrorist attack?
- No.

944
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:57,594
- Wait, there's been a terrorist attack?
- No, there hasn't.

945
00:43:57,628 --> 00:44:00,196
- I've got an email saying we're at war with Libya.
- Nope.

946
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,232
You guys know what's going on,
don't you?

947
00:44:05,303 --> 00:44:09,205
Folks, there hasn't been
a terrorist attack.

948
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,039
None of your friends
and family are in danger.

949
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,776
The president will be speaking
in just a few minutes.

950
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,477
- No.
- Listen, they're just nervous.

951
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:18,347
I don't care.
You do not take over control of the cabin.

952
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:20,015
They're getting emails
and going online.

953
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:23,686
You do not take over
control of the cabin ever.

954
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,521
- Now sit down. I'm getting the captain.
- Ma'am, no, you know--

955
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:28,556
Yeah, get the captain,
'cause I'd like to have a word with him.

956
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:30,891
The seat belt while we're standing still
is one thing, but how paranoid

957
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:33,761
do you have to be to think that
I'm declaring myself in charge of the--

958
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,864
- Is there a problem, sir?
- Yeah, I was asking how paranoid you have to--

959
00:44:36,898 --> 00:44:40,601
- You have to be--
- Sir?

960
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,837
Sir?

961
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:59,151
Captain, my name is Don Keefer.

962
00:44:59,185 --> 00:45:03,088
That's Elliot Hirsch
and that's Sloan Sabbith.

963
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:05,591
<i>We work for Atlantis Cable News.</i>

964
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:08,394
And we wanted you
and your first officer

965
00:45:08,428 --> 00:45:10,596
and Flight Attendant Crazy Lady

966
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:12,498
to be the first ones
on this plane to know

967
00:45:12,532 --> 00:45:15,967
that our armed forces
killed Osama bin Laden for you tonight.

968
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,070
You're serious?

969
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:21,105
Yes, sir.

970
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:41,024
We reported the news.

971
00:45:50,267 --> 00:45:52,301
Sorry, I thought it was a spider.

972
00:45:52,335 --> 00:45:54,069
Tapping you on the shoulder?

973
00:45:54,104 --> 00:45:56,205
- Not everything makes sense.
- Most things do.

974
00:45:56,239 --> 00:45:57,907
Look, can I say something?

975
00:45:57,941 --> 00:45:59,575
You have to get
the last word, too?

976
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,378
- This never would have worked.
- I want to find out.

977
00:46:02,412 --> 00:46:05,680
Yes, this was a fix-up
that I didn't want.

978
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:08,483
And Maggie forced
Valentine's Day on me.

979
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:10,552
And there was a certain
amount of...

980
00:46:10,586 --> 00:46:12,788
cowardly behavior
disguised as politeness.

981
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:15,791
But now I'd like to
ask you out on a first date.

982
00:46:15,825 --> 00:46:18,426
<i>A complete do-over.</i>

983
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,329
I like you and
I'm asking you out on a date.

984
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,333
Took your breath away,
didn't I?

985
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:29,102
Now I get to make a cool exit.

986
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:31,906
Less cool because you said so.

987
00:46:33,475 --> 00:46:35,442
- McAvoy!
- You don't have to shout.

988
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:38,411
You haven't heard me shout.
Where is he?!

989
00:46:38,446 --> 00:46:41,948
Lonny.
Good evening, officers.

990
00:46:41,982 --> 00:46:45,785
Uh-oh. There's no way
they can know, right?

991
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,254
- No.
- Can we help you?

992
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:49,889
Mr. McAvoy,
you know this man?

993
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:52,257
Of course,
he's a very famous jockey.

994
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,726
- You know what--
- Sir, we'd appreciate your cooperation.

995
00:46:54,761 --> 00:46:56,829
He's my bodyguard

996
00:46:56,863 --> 00:46:59,765
and I ran out of the car because
we were stuck in traffic,

997
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:02,534
and chances are he abandoned the car
to try to protect me

998
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,002
'cause he's good at his job.

999
00:47:04,036 --> 00:47:06,304
<i>He's also a former MP
in the US Army,</i>

1000
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:08,506
so I want to tell him something.
Lonny, come here.

1001
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:31,862
- You should tell them.
<i>- You</i> should tell them.

1002
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:38,468
Officers,

1003
00:47:38,502 --> 00:47:40,870
I have some news for you.

1004
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,559
This is Charlie Skinner.

1005
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,728
<i>So, we've established trust?</i>

1006
00:48:06,762 --> 00:48:08,229
Is this Late For Dinner?

1007
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,297
<i>Yeah.</i>

1008
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,432
You work for
the White House or DOD?

1009
00:48:12,466 --> 00:48:14,367
<i>Neither.</i>

1010
00:48:14,402 --> 00:48:16,069
You've been calling me
on a cell phone.

1011
00:48:16,103 --> 00:48:19,239
- There are about 19 different ways--
<i>- The calls are encrypted.</i>

1012
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:21,842
<i>I know how to find out who I am,
but you don't.</i>

1013
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:24,044
- So you're with the NSA?
<i>- I am.</i>

1014
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:26,579
<i>I'm with a unit that's
been monitoring</i>

1015
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,548
<i>illegal electronic surveillance.</i>

1016
00:48:28,582 --> 00:48:30,850
- By whom?
<i>- By AWM.</i>

1017
00:48:30,884 --> 00:48:32,852
News of the World<i>
isn't the only tabloid</i>

1018
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:35,988
<i>that figured out
how to hack a phone.</i>

1019
00:48:36,023 --> 00:48:37,857
If you're fucking
around with me--

1020
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:39,625
<i>I think by now
you know I'm not.</i>

1021
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,293
<i>You've got a big night
ahead of you.</i>

1022
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:43,294
- <i>We'll talk again.</i>
- When?

1023
00:48:43,328 --> 00:48:44,629
<i>When I want to.</i>

1024
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:48,066
AWM owns a tabloid magazine, <i>TMI</i>.

1025
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,668
Are you saying
you have evidence

1026
00:48:49,702 --> 00:48:52,069
that they've been engaging
in the same kind of--

1027
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,504
You're not there, are you?

1028
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,776
Charlie.

1029
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,510
Charlie?

1030
00:49:00,545 --> 00:49:03,380
What if I told you that bin Laden
wasn't the only story we got tonight?

1031
00:49:03,414 --> 00:49:05,449
What are you talking about?

1032
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:10,419
Don't worry about it.

1033
00:49:10,454 --> 00:49:12,722
I think we should go.

1034
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:14,991
Jay Carney or someone's office

1035
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:17,093
would have sent us an email
saying reportable.

1036
00:49:17,127 --> 00:49:19,528
They also would have called us
begging us not to report it.

1037
00:49:19,563 --> 00:49:21,598
I'm unwilling
to take that chance.

1038
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,364
When was the last time
you checked your emails?

1039
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:25,767
- 15 seconds ago.
- When was the last time you did?

1040
00:49:25,802 --> 00:49:27,168
Hmm?

1041
00:49:28,605 --> 00:49:30,706
Look at your BlackBerry.

1042
00:49:32,742 --> 00:49:35,143
- Press the buttons!
- Sure.

1043
00:49:38,914 --> 00:49:41,816
Okay, not tonight,
but in days to come,

1044
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,752
you'll look back and think
that this moment was funny.

1045
00:49:46,554 --> 00:49:49,857
- It's from 20 minutes ago.
- Yeah.

1046
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:53,527
- What's it say?
- "OBL reportable.

1047
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:56,096
Knock 'em dead
just like we did."

1048
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,164
Who's it from?

1049
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:00,867
- Joe Biden.
- Are you kidding me?!

1050
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:03,503
We used to play softball together
when he was in the Senate.

1051
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,438
He knows something
about the landing leg.

1052
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:07,440
Get on the air!

1053
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:10,909
We're going!

1054
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:17,116
When did you turn
into Ted Baxter?

1055
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,452
Oh, come on.
Enjoy the moment.

1056
00:50:20,486 --> 00:50:22,788
Herb, have Washington
throw it to us in 30 seconds.

1057
00:50:22,822 --> 00:50:25,457
Copy that. DC control,
you're gonna throw it here in 30.

1058
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:35,633
Good thinking.

1059
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:37,434
- Let's see the banner.
- Right here.

<i>In five.</i>

1062
00:50:55,153 --> 00:50:56,619
Do it for me, Will.

1063
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:58,254
Good evening.

1064
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,756
From New York City,
I'm Will McAvoy.

1065
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,926
ACN is now able
to report and confirm

1066
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,428
that for the first time
in almost three decades,

1067
00:51:06,462 --> 00:51:09,598
the world has no reason
to fear Osama bin Laden.

1068
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,968
In just a moment,
in a live address to the nation,

1069
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:16,604
the president will announce
that in a coordinated operation

1070
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:19,908
under the cover of darkness,
US Special Forces tonight

1071
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:21,976
<i>killed the leader of al-Qaeda</i>

1072
00:51:22,011 --> 00:51:24,478
<i>and the mastermind
behind the deadly attack</i>

1073
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:27,315
<i>of September 11th, 2001.</i>

1074
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:30,185
It's been nine years,
seven months, and 20 days

1075
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:33,553
since America's most wanted criminal
took from us

1076
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:37,157
2,977 American sons and daughters,

1077
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:40,961
<i>fathers and mothers,
friends and colleagues.</i>

1078
00:51:40,995 --> 00:51:44,431
We were transformed that morning
into a different nation,

1079
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:47,166
more fearful and so,
of course, more hostile.

1080
00:51:47,201 --> 00:51:50,203
And while nothing,
not even this victory

1081
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:52,772
<i>our country has waited for
for such a long time,</i>

1082
00:51:52,806 --> 00:51:55,875
<i>can bring back the souls
lost on that terrible morning</i>

1083
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:58,377
<i>in New York City, in Virginia,</i>

1084
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:00,446
<i>in a field in Pennsylvania,</i>

1085
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,781
<i>and all across America
and the world,</i>

1086
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:05,617
<i>let tonight serve
as a welcome reminder</i>

1087
00:52:05,651 --> 00:52:07,719
that throughout our history,

1088
00:52:07,754 --> 00:52:11,056
America's darkest days
have always been followed

1089
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,625
by its finest hours.

1090
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:17,362
Here now, from the East Room
of the White House,

1091
00:52:17,396 --> 00:52:20,264
the President of the United States.

1092
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:24,969
Good evening.

1093
00:52:25,003 --> 00:52:28,005
<i>Tonight I can report
to the American people</i>

1094
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:30,674
<i>and to the world
that the United States</i>

1095
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:34,044
<i>has conducted an operation
that killed Osama bin Laden,</i>

1096
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:36,112
<i>the leader of al-Qaeda</i>

1097
00:52:36,147 --> 00:52:38,782
<i>and a terrorist who's
responsible for the murder</i>

1098
00:52:38,816 --> 00:52:40,817
<i>of thousands of innocent men,</i>

1099
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:43,486
<i>women, and children.</i>

1100
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,721
<i>It was nearly 10 years ago</i>

1101
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:48,191
<i>that a bright September day
was darkened</i>

1102
00:52:48,225 --> 00:52:51,593
<i>by the worst attack on
the American people in our history.</i>

1103
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:55,931
<i>The images of 9/11 are seared
into our national memory.</i>

1104
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:58,533
<i>Hijacked planes cutting through</i>

1105
00:52:58,567 --> 00:53:01,036
<i>a cloudless September sky.</i>

1106
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,039
<i>The Twin Towers
collapsing to the ground.</i>

1107
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:07,175
<i>Black smoke billowing up
from the Pentagon.</i>

1108
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:10,244
<i>The wreckage of Flight 93</i>

1109
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:12,146
<i>in Shanksville, Pennsylvania,</i>

1110
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:14,115
<i>where the actions
of heroic citizens</i>

1111
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:17,718
<i>saved even more heartbreak
and destruction.</i>

1112
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:20,454
<i>And yet we know
that the worst images</i>

1113
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,956
<i>are those that were
unseen to the world.</i>

1114
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,391
<i>The empty seat
at the dinner table.</i>

1115
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:27,460
<i>Children were forced to
grow up without their mother</i>

1116
00:53:27,494 --> 00:53:29,896
<i>or their father...</i>

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
