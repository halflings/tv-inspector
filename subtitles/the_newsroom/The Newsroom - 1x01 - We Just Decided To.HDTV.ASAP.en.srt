1
00:00:05,573 --> 00:00:08,007
<i>Sharon is a very funny woman,</i>

2
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:10,911
<i>but she has less faith in
American individualism than I do.</i>

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,912
Hang on, I have plenty of--

4
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,780
When did I ever express
any lack of faith?

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,416
I didn't say and never said that
Barack Obama was a socialist.

6
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,618
- Seriously?
- What I said and I have always said--

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,620
Lewis, you are begging me
to run a sound package

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,956
Monday morning that
shows you hundreds of times

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,991
calling the president
a socialist.

10
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,827
I'll read your columns
on the air.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,528
The policies are-- look up the definition,
my friend-- they're socialist.

12
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,997
By your definition,
so were Ronald Reagan's.

13
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,066
What do you think taxes are?

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,534
That was the last
great president.

15
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,235
<i>American individualism
can't build roads.</i>

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,505
- An individual--
- <i>Go on, get it all out.</i>

17
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,941
Thank you, since the question
was addressed to me.

18
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,542
An individual can't build a school

19
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:46,910
or assemble an army--

20
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:49,045
<i>No one's talking
about disbanding the army.</i>

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,247
So we can agree that
the government is good for that?

22
00:00:51,282 --> 00:00:53,016
- Yes. Fine.
- Yes.

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,152
A fire department: Good idea or bad idea?

24
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:57,888
You are getting
so worked up, Sharon.

25
00:00:57,922 --> 00:00:59,823
I'm afraid you're gonna start
shooting light out of your ass.

26
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:02,625
<i>Good idea or bad idea
on the fire department?</i>

27
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:05,595
Or should it be
a private fire department

28
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,162
that only comes
to your burning house

29
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,998
if you paid your
monthly fire bill?

30
00:01:09,032 --> 00:01:11,601
I am more than happy
to pay for a fire department.

31
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:13,268
I am not happy to pay
for a painting

32
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:16,205
that I don't wanna look at,
poetry I don't wanna read.

33
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,239
You can't skip
right to the NEA!

34
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:20,375
<i>And you cannot
skip right to the army.</i>

35
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:47,735
<i>...00004%</i>

36
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,268
<i>of the federal budget</i>

37
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:51,538
<i>and is code for New York,</i>

38
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:54,373
<i>Jewish, perverted, and gay.</i>

39
00:01:54,408 --> 00:01:57,376
- <i>Will.</i>
- Yes, sir.

40
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,846
Anything to add?

41
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:04,583
I think we'd need a more
precise definition of "perverted."

42
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:06,652
Okay.

43
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:08,520
We'll go on
to the next question.

44
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,889
- You, sir.
- My name's Steven.

45
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:13,491
I'm a junior and my question
is for Will McAvoy.

46
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:17,996
Do you consider yourself a Democrat,
a Republican, or Independent?

47
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:22,366
I consider myself
a New York Jets fan, Steven.

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,135
Since it's been brought up,

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,905
you've almost religiously
avoided stating

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,407
or even implying
a political allegiance.

51
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,276
Is that because
as a news anchor

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,412
you feel the integrity of your broadcast
would be compromised?

53
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,315
That sounds like a good answer.

54
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:40,117
I'll take it.

55
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,752
There was a short piece
on <i>Vanity Fair</i>'s website

56
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,222
by Marshall Westbrook--
you probably saw it--

57
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:48,258
where he calls you
the "Jay Leno of news anchors."

58
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,962
<i>- You're popular because you don't bother anyone.</i>
- Yeah.

59
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:55,164
How do you feel about that?

60
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,901
Jealous of the size of Jay's audience.

61
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,737
Are you willing
to say here tonight

62
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:03,573
whether you lean right or left?

63
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:10,579
I've voted for candidates
run by both major parties.

64
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:12,380
Let's move on
to the next question.

65
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,583
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- Hi. My name is Jenny.

66
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:17,085
I'm a sophomore,
and this is for all three of you.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,356
Can you say in one sentence or less...

68
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,691
Um, you know what I mean.

69
00:03:23,726 --> 00:03:28,295
Can you say why America is
the greatest country in the world?

70
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:31,698
Diversity and opportunity.

71
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,200
<i>Lewis.</i>

72
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:36,470
Freedom and freedom.
So let's keep it that way.

73
00:03:37,672 --> 00:03:38,939
Will.

74
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,243
The New York Jets.

75
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:47,780
No, I'm gonna hold you
to an answer on that.

76
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,650
What makes America
the greatest country in the world?

77
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:55,421
Well, Lewis
and Sharon said it--

78
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:57,922
diversity and opportunity
and freedom and freedom.

79
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:11,270
<i>I'm not letting you
go back to the airport</i>

80
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:12,604
without answering the question.

81
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,316
Well, our Constitution
is a masterpiece.

82
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,084
James Madison was a genius.

83
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,819
The Declaration
of Independence is, for me,

84
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,888
the single greatest piece
of American writing.

85
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,760
You don't look satisfied.

86
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:40,430
One's a set of laws and
the other's a declaration of war.

87
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:43,233
I want a human moment from you.

88
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:49,104
What about the people?
Why is America--

89
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:51,006
It's not the greatest country
in the world, Professor.

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,541
That's my answer.

91
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,880
- You're saying--
- Yes.

92
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:02,116
- Let's talk about--
- Fine. Sharon, the NEA is a loser.

93
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,118
Yeah, it accounts for a penny
out of our paycheck,

94
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:06,020
but he gets to hit you
with it any time he wants.

95
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:07,589
It doesn't cost money,
it costs votes.

96
00:05:07,623 --> 00:05:09,591
It costs airtime
and column inches.

97
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,158
You know why people
don't like liberals?

98
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,493
Because they lose.

99
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:13,994
If liberals
are so fuckin' smart,

100
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,697
how come they lose
so goddamn always?

101
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:18,732
- Hey--
- And with a straight face you're gonna tell students

102
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:21,034
that America is
so star-spangled awesome

103
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,237
that we're the only ones
in the world who have freedom?

104
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,306
Canada has freedom.
Japan has freedom.

105
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:29,676
The U.K., France, Italy,
Germany, Spain, Australia.

106
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,945
Belgium has freedom!

107
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,013
207 sovereign states in the world,
like 180 of them have freedom.

108
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,283
- All right--
- And, yeah, you, sorority girl.

109
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:40,152
Just in case you accidentally wander
into a voting booth one day,

110
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:41,587
there are some things
you should know,

111
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:43,556
and one of them is there is
absolutely no evidence

112
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,958
to support the statement that we're
the greatest country in the world.

113
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,761
<i>We're seventh in literacy,
27th in math,</i>

114
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:52,029
<i>22nd in science,
49th in life expectancy,</i>

115
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:54,132
178th in infant mortality,

116
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:55,833
third in median
household income,

117
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,002
number four in labor force,
and number four in exports.

118
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:00,538
We lead the world
in only three categories:

119
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,874
Number of incarcerated
citizens per capita,

120
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,109
number of adults who believe
angels are real,

121
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:06,677
and defense spending
where we spend

122
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,612
more than the next
26 countries combined,

123
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:10,080
25 of whom are allies.

124
00:06:10,114 --> 00:06:12,583
Now, none of this is the fault of
a 20-year-old college student,

125
00:06:12,617 --> 00:06:14,551
but you nonetheless
are without a doubt

126
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:18,088
a member of the worst period
generation period ever period.

127
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:19,890
So when you ask what makes us

128
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:21,291
the greatest country
in the world,

129
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,793
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

130
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:26,195
Yosemite?

131
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,142
We sure used to be.

132
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:43,078
We stood up for what was right.

133
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:44,713
We fought for moral reasons.

134
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:48,050
We passed laws,
struck down laws for moral reasons.

135
00:06:48,084 --> 00:06:51,753
We waged wars on poverty,
not poor people.

136
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,155
We sacrificed.
We cared about our neighbors.

137
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,790
We put our money
where our mouths were

138
00:06:55,825 --> 00:06:57,292
and we never beat our chest.

139
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:58,993
We built great big things,

140
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:02,197
made ungodly
technological advances,

141
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:04,497
explored the universe,
cured diseases,

142
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:07,234
and we cultivated
the world's greatest artists

143
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,137
and the world's
greatest economy.

144
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,608
We reached for the stars,

145
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,211
acted like men.

146
00:07:17,245 --> 00:07:19,545
We aspired to intelligence.
We didn't belittle it.

147
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:23,449
It didn't make us
feel inferior.

148
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:26,385
We didn't identify ourselves
by who we voted for in the last election

149
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,521
and we didn't--
we didn't scare so easy.

150
00:07:30,924 --> 00:07:32,959
Huh.

151
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,026
<i>Ahem, we were able to be
all these things</i>

152
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:38,263
<i>and do all these things
because we were informed.</i>

153
00:07:39,498 --> 00:07:42,367
By great men,
men who were revered.

154
00:07:44,237 --> 00:07:45,904
The first step
in solving any problem

155
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:48,306
is recognizing there is one.

156
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:53,244
America is not the greatest
country in the world anymore.

157
00:07:58,383 --> 00:07:59,950
Enough?

158
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:09,125
- What the fuck was that?
- Are you out of your mind? That was a kid.

159
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,460
I'm sorry!
I'm taking medicine for vertigo

160
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:13,129
and I think it works
because I've got it.

161
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:15,131
You're in trouble, man.
You can't talk to me like that.

162
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,665
- Do you need a doctor?
- Jesus Christ.

163
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,501
Listen, listen!

164
00:08:19,736 --> 00:08:21,470
What did I say out there?

165
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:50,363
Sync, corrected by icephoenix
www.addic7ed.com

166
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:34,562
I'm excited to meet them,
too, but--

167
00:10:43,505 --> 00:10:45,640
I'm excited to meet them,
too, but not tonight.

168
00:10:45,674 --> 00:10:47,541
- It's just too soon.
- When did you decide that?

169
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:49,543
I really can't
pinpoint the time.

170
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:51,044
I have to get back
into my meeting.

171
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,646
It's not a meeting,
it's a party.

172
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,113
- There's pizza.
- We've been dating for four months

173
00:10:54,148 --> 00:10:55,715
and I think that's too soon
to meet her parents.

174
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,783
That's like level three stuff.

175
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,718
We're at level two.
Can I get a ruling?

176
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,520
When your conversation
started in front of my desk,

177
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:02,022
I was concerned
that I'd been caught

178
00:11:02,056 --> 00:11:03,789
in the middle
of something personal,

179
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:07,392
but I can see now that
I was worried for nothing.

180
00:11:07,427 --> 00:11:09,394
I think it's too soon
to meet your parents.

181
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:11,597
I'm not comfortable with it.
Can you respect that?

182
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,098
I've been telling them about you for months.

183
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,833
- What am I supposed to say?
- That I had to work late.

184
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,635
- Why?
- Why does anybody ever have to work late?

185
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,003
They don't.
They're usually lying.

186
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:19,438
That's true, but I know
that you can sell it.

187
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:21,806
Now why would you make
a dumb decision when I'm offering--

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,008
Loyalty-- I'm making
a dumb decision out of loyalty.

189
00:11:24,043 --> 00:11:25,777
You're making a smart one
out of ambition.

190
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,178
Yeah.

191
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,080
He can't remember your name,
Maggie, and I'm the asshole.

192
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:31,415
I was an intern and he
promoted me to his assistant.

193
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,617
He didn't promote you, honey.

194
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,318
He thought you were
his assistant.

195
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:36,753
You have to go back
to your pizza meeting,

196
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,254
but could you do me a favor

197
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:39,856
and not talk about us
in front of--

198
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:42,059
Everybody here knows.
Nobody here cares.

199
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,194
They will once we start fighting
in the middle of the newsroom

200
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:45,963
and one of us
is gonna get fired.

201
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,331
Do you think it's gonna be the
hotshot EP out of Columbia J-school

202
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:49,600
or you think it's gonna
be the intern

203
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,301
who got accidentally
promoted to assistant?

204
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,102
You're making a mistake.

205
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,570
I'm used to them by now.

206
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:57,239
- Loyalty?
- Yep.

207
00:11:57,273 --> 00:11:58,874
He just walked into his office

208
00:11:58,909 --> 00:12:00,542
without noticing
that his staff isn't here.

209
00:12:03,947 --> 00:12:06,682
Text me when you're done
with your parents tonight.

210
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,355
Where's--
where is everybody?

211
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:16,257
Welcome back, man.

212
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:19,260
Thanks.
Where is everybody?

213
00:12:19,294 --> 00:12:21,429
You gotta go up to see Charlie.

214
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:24,564
Okay.
Where is everybody?

215
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,233
I have strict orders
from Charlie

216
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,102
not to say anything until
he's talked to you first.

217
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:29,302
I've got a meeting.

218
00:12:29,337 --> 00:12:31,505
What's going on?

219
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:41,147
Okay.

220
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,883
- Ooh!
- Couldn't say the answer from over there?

221
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,584
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

222
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,787
- Charlie Skinner needs to see you in his office.
- Now?

223
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:50,623
- He said as soon as you come in.
- What's-- You're Ellen?

224
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,391
- Maggie-- Margaret.
- What's going on?

225
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:53,993
We know as little as you do.

226
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,727
- Really?
- Almost as little as you do.

227
00:12:55,762 --> 00:12:57,328
What's the part that
you know that I don't?

228
00:12:57,363 --> 00:12:59,330
- You should talk to Charlie Skinner.
- Where's Karen?

229
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:01,633
- There's no one who works here named Karen.
- My assistant.

230
00:13:01,668 --> 00:13:03,835
- I'm your assistant.
- You're Ellen.

231
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,171
- Margaret.
- Okay.

232
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,506
Uh, I'll let his secretary know
you're on your way.

233
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,910
- Her name is Karen.
- No one's named Karen. No one.

234
00:13:11,944 --> 00:13:14,045
- All right.
- I'll call up for you.

235
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,352
Angela, hi.
It's Maggie from downstairs.

236
00:13:21,387 --> 00:13:23,288
- You can go on in. He's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

237
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,323
<i>You own this now, my friend.
You have bought it.</i>

238
00:13:25,357 --> 00:13:26,957
<i>You have paid for it
and you have the receipt.</i>

239
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,059
<i>I wanna be crystal clear:
This is yours.</i>

240
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,826
<i>You're wearing it.</i>

241
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,495
- <i>Henry wants me to make sure you know that.</i>
- Wait.

242
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:33,297
Mr. Will McAvoy has just
stepped into my office,

243
00:13:33,331 --> 00:13:34,798
so I need to walk him
through this.

244
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:37,201
- <i>Shit, how much does he know?</i>
- You're on speaker.

245
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:38,368
I don't know anything.
Who is this?

246
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:41,538
<i>Heh-hey, Will!
How was the vaca--</i>

247
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,373
Welcome back.
You look great.

248
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,840
I don't know what
just happened there.

249
00:13:44,874 --> 00:13:48,311
Two weeks in St. Lucia was
just what the doctor ordered, literally.

250
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:50,246
- You've got pictures?
- No.

251
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
Don't worry about it.
TMZ does.

252
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:54,550
- You were down there with Erin Andrews.
- There's a picture?

253
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,485
No, that was a trap,
but I knew you were seeing her.

254
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,322
- All right, seriously, what the hell's going on?
- Something exciting.

255
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:01,590
Hardly anybody who works for me
is where they usually are.

256
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:04,492
- I was in a bar in Da Nang.
- Just now?

257
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:05,993
1969.

258
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,431
I was embedded with
the 144th Artillery for UPI,

259
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:11,600
and I was sitting there
with a warm Coke,

260
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,901
watching a beautiful
Vietnamese woman

261
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,070
doing an exotic dance
right in the middle of everybody.

262
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,739
<i>A beautiful, beautiful woman.</i>

263
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:22,109
And I thought to myself,
"I will never know

264
00:14:22,143 --> 00:14:24,245
what it is to be
with a woman like that."

265
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,648
And at that exact moment,
the woman spun twice,

266
00:14:27,682 --> 00:14:29,983
teetered over,
and fell right into my lap.

267
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,918
That was a story
about how sometimes

268
00:14:31,953 --> 00:14:34,254
things fall
right into your lap.

269
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:36,256
Where's my staff?

270
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,058
The answer to that question
has several parts.

271
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:40,993
First, we're gonna try
Elliot out at 10:00.

272
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,528
He's starting in two weeks.

273
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:45,164
Good. Thank you.
With the right EP, he'll do great at 10:00.

274
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,799
I think so, too,
and I know how much

275
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:48,468
he appreciates your
lobbying hard for him.

276
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:49,869
He really looks up to you.

277
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,403
What's this got to do
with my staff?

278
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:53,538
- He's taking your staff.
- What are you talking about?

279
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:56,375
Well, strictly speaking,
he's taking your EP

280
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,877
and your EP's
taking your staff.

281
00:14:57,911 --> 00:14:59,444
- Wait, Don's going with Elliot?
- Listen--

282
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,046
- Where is he?
- There's no need--

283
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:04,416
- Where is he?
- They're both-- Don got everyone pizza.

284
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,251
<i>They're in one
of the conference rooms.</i>

285
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:07,752
<i>Will!</i>

286
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:10,021
I gave him his first job on the air,
his first job on a panel,

287
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:11,722
his first job
as a substitute anchor.

288
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,025
I make it known to anyone who matters
I'd like to see him at 10:00.

289
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,727
- He poaches Don.
- Elliot didn't poach him. Don asked to go.

290
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,997
- He asked to go? He asked to go?
- Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:21,665
- Because of what happened?
- Absolutely not. That's over.

292
00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:23,233
It's not over.
The story won't end.

293
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:25,102
Did anybody hear
the second half of what I said?

294
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,137
- I made a rousing call--
- It's not why Don's leaving.

295
00:15:27,172 --> 00:15:30,174
- Why is he leaving?
- Oh!

296
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,675
Yeah, I get that
there are moments,

297
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,110
small moments,
infrequent moments,

298
00:15:33,144 --> 00:15:34,678
where I'm not the easiest
guy to work with,

299
00:15:34,712 --> 00:15:36,213
- but who the hell is?
- I am.

300
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:38,147
Well, it helps that you're drunk
most of the time.

301
00:15:38,182 --> 00:15:39,648
It certainly does.
Do me a favor--

302
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:41,483
This is more than unprofessional,
it's uncivilized.

303
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,819
But more than that,
it's unprofessional.

304
00:15:42,853 --> 00:15:44,486
- Just do me a favor, okay?
- Sure.

305
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:46,655
- Try not to make a scene--
- Hey, dickless!

306
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,157
Not you.

307
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,926
You're in a minute.
You.

308
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,861
- Hey, Will.
- Congratulations on the show. You're gonna do great.

309
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:55,030
I'd have called you,
but I didn't know where you were staying.

310
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,664
I kept getting
an out-of-the-office reply--

311
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:58,399
You're taking
my executive producer?

312
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:01,002
- Before you go any further, I strongly objected.
- Did you?

313
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:03,771
- For all the reasons--
- I think this conversation's about me.

314
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,606
Catlike instincts.

315
00:16:05,641 --> 00:16:07,775
- I tried to get in touch with you, but Charlie said--
- You asked to leave?

316
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,077
- I did, but we have two weeks before--
- Because of what happened?

317
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:12,146
- No.
- Because the second half was a rousing call to--

318
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,281
- It has nothing to do with what happened.
- The timing is curious.

319
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,050
Didn't you tell him it doesn't have
anything to do with what happened?

320
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:18,685
Yes, and talk to <i>him</i>
when you're talking to him.

321
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,222
After all the time we spent
working side by side?

322
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,890
I've been your EP for 13 weeks.

323
00:16:22,924 --> 00:16:24,725
That's the longest I've ever
worked with anybody!

324
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,492
I mean, you were the one.
You were my guy.

325
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,660
We were like
the Everly Brothers.

326
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:29,262
You'll interview
some good candidates.

327
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:32,131
Don, please,
I'll replace you in 15 minutes.

328
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:34,934
You know, it wasn't
the anti-American thing, Will,

329
00:16:34,969 --> 00:16:38,371
or even that you aimed a profanity-laced
tirade at a college sophomore--

330
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:41,573
She's talking about suing the university
for mental anguish.

331
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:44,243
- Talking about it to who?
- Mostly Kathie Lee and Hoda.

332
00:16:44,277 --> 00:16:46,278
- Guess who her lawyer is.
- If you say Gloria Allred--

333
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:49,314
- It's your personality.
- What?

334
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:51,383
The reason I'm leaving
and the reason the others are.

335
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,885
I'm affable!

336
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,187
To strangers, to people
who watch you on TV.

337
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,021
You yelled at me
in front of the crew.

338
00:16:57,055 --> 00:16:59,823
- That's what this is about.
- <i>Yes, that's what this is about.</i>

339
00:16:59,858 --> 00:17:01,792
Yeah, you know, I thought
you were talking into my ear.

340
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,160
<i>That's what I'm supposed to do.</i>

341
00:17:03,195 --> 00:17:05,128
I had Stanley McChrystal
on satellite from Kandahar.

342
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:06,930
He's being shot at
by the fucking Taliban

343
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:08,565
and you were yakking in my ear.

344
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,467
I wasn't yakking. I was telling you
not to let him off the hook.

345
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:12,936
Was that something that really
needed to be said four times?

346
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,571
Yeah, because you
let him off the hook,

347
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:16,774
as was pointed out by everyone
with Internet access.

348
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:19,009
You blew that interview
and you took it out on me.

349
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,643
It was two days after the thing
with the student.

350
00:17:20,677 --> 00:17:23,112
I thought it would be a good idea to
show deference to a three-star--

351
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,782
You took it out on me,
you did it in front of the staff,

352
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:28,451
then you took it out on the staff
the way you're doing right now.

353
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,052
The staff isn't here!

354
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:31,854
You're taking
the department heads.

355
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,423
Who the hell knows
who they're taking?

356
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,690
Maggie's standing right there.

357
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:37,025
Her name happens to be Ellen!

358
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,361
<i>It's Margaret.</i>

359
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:42,431
And simply put,
you are a smart,

360
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:44,633
talented guy
who isn't very nice

361
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,501
and the countdown to your retirement
from relevance...

362
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:47,836
- All right.
<i>- ..started the moment</i>

363
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,471
you called conservatives idiots
and liberals losers.

364
00:17:49,505 --> 00:17:51,705
- That's enough.
- A bad reaction to vertigo medicine?

365
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,507
- Don.
- Did you just send that gift-wrapped

366
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,642
to every comedian in the world?

367
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,143
I didn't have a lot
of time to think.

368
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:58,211
- Do you think maybe if you'd let me prep you--
- Don.

369
00:17:58,246 --> 00:18:00,180
- You had a brand!
- I'm a Marine, Don!

370
00:18:00,214 --> 00:18:01,682
I will beat the shit
out of you!

371
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:03,818
I don't care how many
protein bars you eat.

372
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:07,220
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
All right.

373
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:13,259
All right, look,
I'm sorry I said all that.

374
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,595
No, it's easier to say
than the truth.

375
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:18,130
- What?
- You're jumping a sinking ship.

376
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:21,133
You've always been
the smartest guy around here.

377
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,739
I appreciate you promoting me up
as fast as you did.

378
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,407
And I will work
with whoever you hire

379
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,478
to make it a smooth transition
over the next two weeks.

380
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,683
- Is that the afternoon brief?
- Yeah.

381
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,255
I'm--
I'm sorry about all this.

382
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,592
No, no, no.
Good luck with the show, man.

383
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,494
I'm here for whatever you need.

384
00:18:53,064 --> 00:18:54,999
You did let McChrystal
off the hook

385
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,666
because you were gun-shy
after Northwestern.

386
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,768
- He was right about that.
- I didn't let him off the hook.

387
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,404
He's a general.
He's a professional strategist, Charlie.

388
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:02,839
He's schooled
in evasive tactics.

389
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:04,574
Against armies,
not journalists.

390
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:06,342
Chief Brody, Hooper,
and Captain Quint

391
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:09,613
- didn't let Jaws off the hook is what I'm saying.
- All right.

392
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:12,080
- I didn't know.
- What?

393
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:14,282
I didn't know that people
didn't like working for me.

394
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,284
- Do you care?
- No.

395
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,921
Of course I care.
Anybody would care.

396
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,056
But honestly, I don't.

397
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,058
I do.
I am a perfectly nice guy

398
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:24,860
and I have the focus group
data to prove it,

399
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:26,128
so maybe the problem
lies not with me--

400
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:30,131
- I hired a new EP for you.
- What do you mean?

401
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:33,735
- I hired you a new EP.
- You hi-- you--

402
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,236
I'm never going
on vacation again.

403
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,672
You hired a new EP
without my meeting him?

404
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,574
- Her.
- Without my meeting her?

405
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,309
- No, you've met her.
- Who?

406
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:47,814
Charlie, have you hired
to run my show,

407
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,282
without consulting me--

408
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:50,784
You were unreachable.

409
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,485
Only one person knew
how to get in touch with you.

410
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,055
- It was you!
- I had to right the ship.

411
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:58,825
You know that for this particular job,
there's no one better.

412
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:01,427
You're not talking
about Mackenzie.

413
00:20:01,461 --> 00:20:03,095
I had to right the ship.

414
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:05,297
You're too big an asset
to screw around with

415
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:08,233
and your focus group data isn't saying
what it said three weeks ago.

416
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,036
- Charlie--
- She was in Peshawar...

417
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,337
- Oh, my God.
- ..for four months.

418
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:14,273
The Green Zone
for a year before that.

419
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,174
Her guys were filing
stories from caves.

420
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,676
She comes home,

421
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,144
she wants to be an EP again,
have a normal life,

422
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,748
and there's nothing for her at CNN,
nothing for her at ABC.

423
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,718
- I knew that.
- She's exhausted.

424
00:20:26,752 --> 00:20:29,087
Not like at the end
of a long day.

425
00:20:29,121 --> 00:20:31,556
She's mentally
and physically exhausted.

426
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,858
She hasn't had four hours' sleep
in two years.

427
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:38,161
She's been shot at
in three different countries.

428
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:41,565
And she's been to way
too many funerals for a girl her age.

429
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,735
- She wants to come home.
- Yeah, look, I don't blame her.

430
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:48,771
They don't have a job for her in Atlanta,
DC, or New York.

431
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:51,407
Mackenzie-- line up
any 10 people,

432
00:20:51,441 --> 00:20:53,977
eight of them will tell you
she's the best EP in the business

433
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,245
and the other two
will be stupid!

434
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,347
I'm one of the eight,
but it's not gonna happen.

435
00:20:58,381 --> 00:20:59,849
- It's happened.
- No.

436
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,719
She's coming up from DC today
with one of her people.

437
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:05,153
No, listen to what I'm telling you--
I can't give my approval.

438
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,455
The deal's a day away from
being signed-- three years.

439
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,825
I have approval over
my executive producer.

440
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:12,293
- You would think so, wouldn't you?
- I would, yeah.

441
00:21:12,328 --> 00:21:14,229
Business Affairs went
through your whole deal.

442
00:21:14,263 --> 00:21:15,897
I don't have
contractual approval?

443
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:18,233
- No. But you know what?
- I don't have contractual approval?

444
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:21,002
You're up for renegotiation
in 18 months.

445
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,436
I'd have your agent
put that clause--

446
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,639
No, I'm walking down the street
to William Morris.

447
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:27,207
- I'm gonna renegotiate my contract right now.
- It's not gonna go your way.

448
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,911
I generate an annual profit
of $210 million on my own.

449
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:33,781
That's not counting the lead-in freight
I push to 9:00 and 10:00.

450
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,449
That may be tipping money for
this company, but it's not nothing.

451
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,483
- Will.
- What?

452
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,119
When was the last time
you saw her?

453
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:40,620
I don't know.
About three years ago.

454
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,322
Coincidentally, that's the last time
you were a nice guy!

455
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:48,361
Would you like another,
Mr. Skinner?

456
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,196
Yes, please.

457
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,831
<i>Most notably Lehman's
former CEO Richard Fuld,</i>

458
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:56,368
<i>seen here testifying to the House
Oversight Committee on Capitol Hill.</i>

459
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:59,772
<i>The 2,200 pages report a serious
lapse by top executives</i>

460
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,374
<i>and details the accounting
gimmick used by Lehman</i>

461
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:05,678
<i>including the use of something
they call the repo 105</i>

462
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:09,113
<i>to move about $50 billion
in debt off of the books.</i>

463
00:22:09,148 --> 00:22:11,683
<i>They say the company
withheld information.</i>

464
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:14,085
<i>They further outlined
an auditor failure, saying that</i>

465
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,721
<i>Ernst & Young basically
was performing...</i>

466
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,290
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

467
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:20,225
- I'm Mackenzie McHale.
- How can I help you?

468
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:22,561
I'm supposed to be
meeting with Will.

469
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:25,028
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry.

470
00:22:25,063 --> 00:22:27,097
- You're Mackenzie.
- I am. And you are?

471
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:28,599
- I'm Mag--
- Mac.

472
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:32,236
Hey, Don.

473
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,104
Mackenzie gave me
my first summer internship.

474
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:36,973
Don't tell me you're here
to interview for my job.

475
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,609
No, I'm here to do your job.

476
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,310
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

477
00:22:40,344 --> 00:22:42,312
- I don't understand.
<i>- I</i> don't understand.

478
00:22:42,346 --> 00:22:44,314
When were you hired?

479
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,416
- Is Will in his office?
- He's not, but his agent's office

480
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,851
is just down the street and
he should be back any minute.

481
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:56,125
- He's at his agent's office?
- Yes...

482
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,427
- I'm sorry. I gave too much information.
- Yep.

483
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,662
Now I understand.

484
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:01,663
What's your name?

485
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,164
- Maggie.
- Maggie.

486
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:04,666
Let me try to guess
at something

487
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:07,102
and you tell me how close
I am to being right.

488
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,672
This whole move was done behind
Will's back and he just found out now,

489
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:12,373
and he stormed off
to his agent's office

490
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:15,109
to see why he doesn't
have approval.

491
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:19,113
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

492
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,881
Okay.

493
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:25,119
All right, you're going
to see some things.

494
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:30,790
I'm just gonna sit here
till he gets back.

495
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm going to sit here.

496
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:34,994
Good luck.

497
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:38,698
This still looking good to you?

498
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:50,342
You said your name was Maggie?

499
00:23:50,377 --> 00:23:52,678
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am? How old do I look?

500
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:54,179
No! No, no, no.

501
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:55,681
I heard you were
embedded for a while.

502
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:57,616
26 months.
Anything happen while I was gone?

503
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,918
- That's why I called you ma'am.
- So did the Marines.

504
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,852
You sure don't look like
you've been in a war.

505
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:04,289
The first thing I did when I got back
was buy women's clothes.

506
00:24:04,323 --> 00:24:05,890
I maxed out three credit cards.

507
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:07,892
But I figured, "Hey, the economy's booming,
so what the heck?"

508
00:24:07,926 --> 00:24:09,694
- Oh, God.
- I'm kidding.

509
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,531
Oh, excuse me.

510
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,366
It's all right.

511
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:18,968
Hi, Dad.
I'm fine.

512
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:21,271
I left a message for you
and Mom at the hotel

513
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:22,739
because I wanted
to let you know

514
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:25,074
it'll just be the three of us
for dinner tonight.

515
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:28,044
Don can't make it.

516
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:29,913
He has to work late.

517
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:31,348
He just does.

518
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:34,049
You know, with him running
10:00 now, he's so--

519
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,584
And he feels terrible about it.

520
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:39,288
He was really looking forward
to meeting you.

521
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:42,224
I know,
but in this case it's true.

522
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:47,763
So, great. So I'll meet you guys
in the lobby at 9:15.

523
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:49,664
Okay. Bye, Dad.

524
00:24:56,706 --> 00:24:59,674
You okay?

525
00:24:59,709 --> 00:25:04,378
- Oh, I've just got an allergy.
- To what?

526
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:06,380
Oysters.

527
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,720
- I hate lying to my father.
- I wasn't lying.

528
00:25:12,754 --> 00:25:14,688
Yeah. Why won't
Don go to dinner?

529
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,858
He thinks it's too early?

530
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,193
- Don's not my boyfriend.
- He's in a picture on your desk.

531
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,195
<i>It's with a couple of your friends
so it's not obvious,</i>

532
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,997
<i>but it's a picture
of your boyfriend.</i>

533
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,265
I don't care.

534
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,100
- I'm not reporting you to HR.
- Thank you.

535
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,536
Does he want you to do things in the bedroom
you're uncomfortable with?

536
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,037
- No.
- Damn it.

537
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,339
These are just
routine questions.

538
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,874
You put that all together
really fast.

539
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,642
It's not an original story.

540
00:25:41,013 --> 00:25:42,647
My dad knew I was lying.

541
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:46,351
Now he's gonna hate Don,
and that's not what I wanted to happen.

542
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:56,694
- <i>Oh, I'm fine.</i>
- Your eyes are red.

543
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:58,696
Turn and face me.

544
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:03,166
When he calls you tonight
at 11:00 and wants to come by,

545
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:04,702
don't lay on
a tone of voice--

546
00:26:04,736 --> 00:26:07,004
Just tell him real nice that you're
hanging with your roommates

547
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:08,872
and you'll see him at work.

548
00:26:08,906 --> 00:26:12,809
Do that three times.
He'll get the idea.

549
00:26:12,843 --> 00:26:14,744
Are you going
with Don to 10:00?

550
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:17,246
- No.
- Why not?

551
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:19,649
It's just that I was...

552
00:26:20,851 --> 00:26:22,519
Loyalty.

553
00:26:22,553 --> 00:26:24,620
I'm Will's assistant.

554
00:26:24,654 --> 00:26:27,423
No, associate producer.

555
00:26:27,457 --> 00:26:30,426
You're an associate
producer now.

556
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,895
I'm crazy about loyalty.

557
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:34,463
- You'll report to...
- Mac!

558
00:26:34,497 --> 00:26:35,964
- ..him.
- Mac!

559
00:26:35,998 --> 00:26:39,301
Did you know--
Did you know--

560
00:26:39,335 --> 00:26:41,068
- Are you all right?
- Jim, that's Louis Vuitton luggage.

561
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:43,237
I'm fine, thank you.
Can I talk to you a second?

562
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:45,105
Sure. James Harper,
this is Maggie--

563
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,607
- Margaret.
- This is Maggie Margaret.

564
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,075
Margaret Jordan.
Maggie's fine.

565
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,478
Nice to meet you.
Now, please.

566
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:53,948
- Did you hurt anything?
- Mm-hmm, everything, I think, but please...

567
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:58,184
Did you know that Will McAvoy

568
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,853
didn't know that
you were hired as EP

569
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:01,488
and that he's at his
agent's office right now?

570
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:04,123
I didn't know that when the day began,
but I know it now.

571
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,691
I quit my job for this, Mac,

572
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,927
and so did the three other people
you told me to bring.

573
00:27:07,962 --> 00:27:09,495
Our show was canceled,
so we were out of work anyway.

574
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,930
I was offered any other show
I wanted at CNN.

575
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:12,865
- I know, but I wasn't.
- That's not the point.

576
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,867
- Excuse me.
- It's aggravating when you rise to a position of--

577
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,036
You know,
a certain position of--

578
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:18,972
I put down first
and last month's rent.

579
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:21,440
- Do I have a job in New York?
- Yes, of course you do.

580
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:22,775
- You're sure?
- No.

581
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,510
I'm calling Tom Walton
and begging for a job.

582
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,144
- I'll cover hurricanes.
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

583
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:27,346
What? And why
didn't you tell me

584
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,981
there's some kind of problem
with you and Will?

585
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:31,817
Because that's personal.
Do you see me asking personal questions?

586
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:34,353
- When's the last time you were in love with a woman?
- What?

587
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:36,855
When was the last time you had a passionate
relationship with a woman?

588
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,523
Like Hollywood love,
high school love?

589
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,991
You know the only reason
I'm still standing here

590
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,225
is that I have
nowhere else to go, right?

591
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,694
I do know that.
When was the last time?

592
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,796
- Never. That's never happened.
- Right.

593
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,430
And you know how you've always
had a crush on me?

594
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:49,300
- I have never had a crush on you.
- Yeah, it's been cute.

595
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,568
Never had a crush on you,
but go ahead.

596
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,470
The girl you just met,
Maggie--

597
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,438
she's me before I grew into myself
and got hotter with age.

598
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,841
I don't understand why you chose
this moment to lose it!

599
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,143
- Just--
- Why are you afraid to see Will McAvoy?

600
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:02,445
- You have to tell me.
- Hey, jughead, I ain't afraid of nothing

601
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,314
except jellyfish,
which is completely normal.

602
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:07,117
- Now look at the girl. Not a big look, stupid.
- I didn't look at all.

603
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:10,620
You're right.
Okay, just glance over.

604
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:15,992
Cupid, bam!

605
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:18,928
Can we cut to the chase?
What's in this for you?

606
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,897
Now why does it
have to be like that?

607
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:22,164
It doesn't, but it is.

608
00:28:22,198 --> 00:28:25,133
I need Don Keefer to help me
through this transition.

609
00:28:25,167 --> 00:28:26,768
It turns out
Don's dating Maggie

610
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:28,469
and I'm not sure
he's right for her.

611
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:31,072
Really? After knowing them
as a couple for this long, you're not sure?

612
00:28:31,106 --> 00:28:32,641
He's going to be
threatened by you,

613
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,876
so he'll try to impress Maggie,
who's staying with Will.

614
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,578
- You understand?
- Yeah, I'm calling Walton.

615
00:28:36,612 --> 00:28:39,681
- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.
- What?

616
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:43,884
You're right.

617
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:49,023
You've done enough.

618
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:52,860
You've done everything
I've ever asked you to do

619
00:28:52,894 --> 00:28:55,228
and a ton of stuff
I'd never ask anyone to do.

620
00:28:58,699 --> 00:29:01,400
Tell me where you want to work
and I'll make the call.

621
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:03,135
- Look--
- Fly away, little bird.

622
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,638
- Jesus. You know what--
- Something great is about to happen here

623
00:29:05,673 --> 00:29:07,373
and you're gonna want
to be a part of it.

624
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:10,743
- Tell me what the problem is with you and Will.
- I can't.

625
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,980
Put the phone away.

626
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:18,850
This is a solid promise:

627
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:20,619
We're going to do
the best news on TV.

628
00:29:20,653 --> 00:29:23,188
- Either that or...?
- We'll all be filling out job applications

629
00:29:23,222 --> 00:29:26,058
at Dave & Buster's,
but we'll be doing it together.

630
00:29:26,092 --> 00:29:30,628
- Now you just sit here a minute, all right?
- Sure.

631
00:29:30,662 --> 00:29:32,162
- Do you know how to flirt?
- Yes.

632
00:29:32,197 --> 00:29:35,332
- Show me.
- Hi.

633
00:29:35,366 --> 00:29:37,802
Okay, just sit here.

634
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:39,169
We're gonna be great!

635
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:42,006
- Where's the rest of the staff?
- They left.

636
00:29:53,784 --> 00:29:57,120
Hi, Will.
It's good to see you.

637
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,191
This is Jim Harper,
my senior producer.

638
00:30:03,226 --> 00:30:04,960
- The others are coming up--
- Let's go in my office.

639
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:08,196
- Sure.
- Somebody wanna tell Don the lunch party's over

640
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:09,798
and I need someone
on the assignment desk

641
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:12,001
in case there happens to be--
what do you call it-- news?

642
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:14,302
Can I get you
some coffee or anything?

643
00:30:14,337 --> 00:30:16,738
- Water or maybe--
- We're fine.

644
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,453
I tried to get in touch with you
while you were on vacation.

645
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,154
Nobody seemed to know
how to do that.

646
00:30:34,188 --> 00:30:37,390
Or at least they weren't
willing to say.

647
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:43,830
Actually, I've tried
to get in touch with you

648
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:45,732
a lot of times
in the last three years.

649
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:46,867
Did you get
all those e-mails?

650
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:48,101
- Yeah.
<i>- What did you think?</i>

651
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:50,803
- I didn't read them.
- I understand.

652
00:30:50,837 --> 00:30:52,805
There's no need to apologize.

653
00:30:54,474 --> 00:30:56,308
Thank you.

654
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,186
You look good
after your vacation.

655
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
You look rested.

656
00:31:09,254 --> 00:31:10,488
I've never been
to St. Lucia.

657
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,723
- Is it great?
- Yeah.

658
00:31:11,757 --> 00:31:13,191
You were down there
with Erin Andrews?

659
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:14,559
It's not my business.

660
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:16,161
You can go anywhere
with anyone.

661
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:18,462
Thank you again.

662
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,865
Hey, this can work.

663
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,267
In fact, it's gonna work great.

664
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:26,436
I asked my agent to negotiate
a three-year contract.

665
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,038
You know me-- I think
that's the longest contract--

666
00:31:28,073 --> 00:31:30,207
It's not a three-year
contract anymore.

667
00:31:30,241 --> 00:31:33,643
- I'm sorry?
- Not a three-year contract anymore.

668
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:37,379
It's a 156-week contract
that gives me the opportunity

669
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:40,683
to fire you 155 times
at the end of each week.

670
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:42,885
We'll wait a few months
to make sure it's not a story

671
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,688
Bill Carter can shove up my ass.
We'll do it, then.

672
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,990
How did you get
my contract changed?

673
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:50,392
I gave the network back
some money off my salary.

674
00:31:50,427 --> 00:31:52,361
- How much money?
- A million dollars a year.

675
00:31:52,395 --> 00:31:54,562
- You gave back a million dollars a year?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

676
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:56,765
You paid a million dollars to be
able to fire me any time you want?

677
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,401
$3 million. And not any time I want,
just the end of each week.

678
00:32:03,106 --> 00:32:05,907
How the hell much money
do you get paid?

679
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:08,409
- Don?
- Speaking.

680
00:32:08,444 --> 00:32:11,112
You should meet James Harper,
Mackenzie's senior producer.

681
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,647
- Jim.
- Were you with Mackenzie in Afghanistan?

682
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,950
Yeah.
And Iraq.

683
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:18,619
And sometimes
when you're in Afghanistan,

684
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,721
it turns out you're
really in Pakistan.

685
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:22,923
- 26 months.
- You ever produce from the studio?

686
00:32:22,958 --> 00:32:25,691
For about a year in Atlanta
before Mackenzie took me out.

687
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,094
- She's crazy, you know.
- I know.

688
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:29,996
I've never seen anyone love
being an American so much.

689
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,232
And when you factor in she isn't
an American, it's all very--

690
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,300
Yeah, she is American,
actually.

691
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:37,603
Her dad was Margaret Thatcher's
Ambassador to the UN and she was born here.

692
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:39,038
Yeah, and immediately
locked in her room

693
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:40,906
and shown Frank Capra movies
until she was 21.

694
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,108
She's like a sophomore poli-sci major
at Sarah Lawrence.

695
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:46,145
Exactly like that.
Yeah.

696
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:48,413
I guess the only real differences
are her two Peabodys

697
00:32:48,447 --> 00:32:50,382
and the scar on her stomach
from the knife wound she got

698
00:32:50,416 --> 00:32:53,451
covering a Shiite protest
in Islamabad.

699
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:56,088
Welcome.

700
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:58,022
I'm just taking
your temperature.

701
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,258
On a scale of 1-10,
how much trouble am I in with you?

702
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,193
Oh, I'm over it.

703
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:03,727
<i>Hey, do this to me.</i>

704
00:33:03,762 --> 00:33:06,630
Do this to me all you want,
but you can't do it to them.

705
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:08,732
- Who?
- People followed me here--

706
00:33:08,767 --> 00:33:10,701
Jim Harper, my senior producer,

707
00:33:10,735 --> 00:33:13,069
bookers, H&A producer,
desk editors, field producers--

708
00:33:13,104 --> 00:33:15,405
- They can't possibly be my problem.
- Will, come on now.

709
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,973
What do you want from me,
Mackenzie?

710
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,441
They're in the process
of moving.

711
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:19,976
They've put down
security deposits.

712
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,812
<i>They found roommates.
They're looking at preschools--</i>

713
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:25,816
Yeah, they fucked up, Mac!
They trusted you!

714
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,498
You've got a news alert.

715
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,205
Pardon me, Don.

716
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,207
<i>You've got a news alert.</i>

717
00:33:57,612 --> 00:33:59,413
It's yellow.

718
00:34:17,267 --> 00:34:19,557
There's been an explosion
off the coast of Louisiana.

719
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,535
How can there be an explosion
in the middle of the water?

720
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,838
- An oil rig.
- An oil rig.

721
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,845
"Well explosion
in the Gulf of Mexico."

722
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:37,849
All right, Tess,
get on the assignment desk

723
00:34:37,884 --> 00:34:40,018
- and see if this goes anywhere.
- Okay.

724
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:45,023
"Flames reach 150 feet
in the air."

725
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:50,928
If you had read any of my e-mails
or answered my calls,

726
00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:54,598
you'd know that I take responsibility
for everything and...

727
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:56,901
I already did know that
and I already didn't care.

728
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:58,235
That I'm sorry.

729
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,971
- Are you?
- Yes.

730
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:05,008
Mackenzie, I--

731
00:35:05,042 --> 00:35:08,477
I just-- You have no idea how
I've longed to hear those words.

732
00:35:08,512 --> 00:35:10,746
I--

733
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:12,681
I forgive you.
Can you forgive--

734
00:35:12,716 --> 00:35:15,251
- You're being sarcastic.
- Oh, how you know me.

735
00:35:15,286 --> 00:35:17,420
"Emergency rescue crews
arrive on location

736
00:35:17,454 --> 00:35:20,589
at burning well
located 50 miles offshore.

737
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:22,424
12 to 15 people
believed missing."

738
00:35:22,458 --> 00:35:24,259
- It's still yellow.
- Still yellow.

739
00:35:24,294 --> 00:35:26,194
Don, they just haven't
changed the color yet.

740
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,762
Somebody should
tell Will or at least--

741
00:35:27,797 --> 00:35:30,299
I'm not knocking
on Will's door right now,

742
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,100
and you don't work here yet.

743
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:35,137
- So, dude, relax. Anything new?
- <i>No.</i>

744
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:36,771
- There might be.
- There won't be.

745
00:35:36,806 --> 00:35:38,705
An oil rig
in the Gulf exploded.

746
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,874
- Persian Gulf?
- No, the Gulf of Mexico.

747
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:43,411
- Kendra.
<i>- BP Deepwater Horizon.</i>

748
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,947
It's about 50 miles southeast
of Venice, Louisiana.

749
00:35:45,981 --> 00:35:47,815
The Coast Guard
evacuated seven people,

750
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,250
all of them critically injured,

751
00:35:49,284 --> 00:35:51,052
<i>and they're searching
for 11 confirmed missing.</i>

752
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:54,955
- Still yellow.
- Isn't it possible that AP's busy right now

753
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:56,522
and they've got
an intern on the updates?

754
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,524
They may have bigger problems
than the missing crew.

755
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,527
What do you mean? What do you mean
bigger problems than the missing crew?

756
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:05,598
Hang on! Hang on!
Listen to what he said.

757
00:36:05,632 --> 00:36:08,268
- What did you say?
- I said they may have

758
00:36:08,302 --> 00:36:09,969
bigger problems
than the missing crew.

759
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,072
- Why?
- I checked out BP Deepwater Horizon.

760
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,907
That rig is drilling at 18,000 feet
below sea level.

761
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,409
There are only a couple of things
that could have failed.

762
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:19,278
- And if it was the wrong one--
- Pressure.

763
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,780
It would be like trying
to toss a hat on a fire hose.

764
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,115
What the hell are you two
talking about?

765
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,783
It's more than 11 missing guys.

766
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:26,117
There might be
a massive oil spill

767
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,918
50 miles off the coast
of Louisiana.

768
00:36:27,953 --> 00:36:30,455
- I'm sorry, man. Tell me who you are again.
- I'm Jim Harper.

769
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,291
And I may or may not be, but almost
definitely won't be a senior producer here

770
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:34,825
under Mackenzie
if she still has a job,

771
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,061
which sounds like she
probably absolutely doesn't.

772
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,929
Okay, well, whatever it is
doesn't start for two weeks,

773
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,331
so you're still in my newsroom

774
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:42,332
and you're behaving in a way
that is bothering me.

775
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,567
- Gotta be blunt.
- Got it.

776
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:46,736
The truck in Pasadena,
they're five blocks from the courthouse.

777
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,438
<i>Are they covering the Rose Bowl?</i>

778
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,707
<i>And I cannot look
at the same loop of people...</i>

779
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,576
This is Jim Harper.

780
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,645
All right.

781
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,353
<i>For the moment,
your people can have their jobs.</i>

782
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:07,589
Like I said, I have to wait to make the move
because there was a press release.

783
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,090
But when I hire the new EP,

784
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:11,226
who I will hire
by hiring them myself--

785
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,862
whoever it is is going to get to
interview the new people.

786
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:16,197
All right.

787
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:19,635
Well, I appreciate that.

788
00:37:19,669 --> 00:37:21,836
They're really good, Will.
You're gonna want to keep them.

789
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:24,071
- Don't just dump them because of--
- They'll get a fair chance.

790
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:27,041
- Okay.
- I haven't started my script.

791
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:29,410
I'll get out of your way.

792
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:42,288
There's nothing that's more important
in a democracy

793
00:37:42,322 --> 00:37:43,823
than a well-informed
electorate.

794
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:46,092
You know you're still
on this side of the door.

795
00:37:46,126 --> 00:37:48,428
When there's no information or,
much worse, wrong information,

796
00:37:48,462 --> 00:37:50,030
it can lead
to calamitous decisions

797
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:52,065
and clobber any attempts
at vigorous debate.

798
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,733
- That's why I produce the news.
- We're all grateful to you.

799
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,501
- You're spinning out of control.
- No, I'm not.

800
00:37:56,536 --> 00:37:58,470
You're terrified you're going to
lose your audience

801
00:37:58,504 --> 00:38:00,105
and you'd do anything
to get them back.

802
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:02,841
You're one pitch meeting away
from doing the news in 3-D.

803
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:04,342
This isn't nonprofit theater.

804
00:38:04,377 --> 00:38:06,144
It's advertiser-supported
television.

805
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:08,646
- You know that, right?
- I'd rather do a good show for 100 people

806
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:10,848
than a bad one for a million,
if that's what you're saying.

807
00:38:10,883 --> 00:38:12,750
What is it you're talking
to me about right now?

808
00:38:12,785 --> 00:38:14,786
I've come here to produce
a news broadcast

809
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,621
that more closely
resembles the one we did

810
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:20,892
before you got popular
by not bothering anyone, Leno.

811
00:38:20,926 --> 00:38:24,395
I think Jay and I would rather be employed,
if it's all the same to you.

812
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,530
It's not all the same to me,
you punk.

813
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:29,933
I've come here to take
your IQ and your talent

814
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:32,535
and put it to some
patriotic fucking use.

815
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,038
And where does it say that a good
news show can't be popular?

816
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:37,273
- Nielsen ratings.
- We're going to do a good news show

817
00:38:37,308 --> 00:38:39,109
and make it popular
at the same time.

818
00:38:39,143 --> 00:38:40,977
- That is impossible.
- Between your brains,

819
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:44,513
- charm, looks, and affability and my...
- Refusal to live in reality.

820
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:46,616
- ..expertise in producing you--
- It's impossible, Mac!

821
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,251
- Ugh!
- Social scientists have concluded

822
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,220
that the country
is more polarized

823
00:38:51,254 --> 00:38:53,222
than at any time
since the Civil War.

824
00:38:53,256 --> 00:38:56,891
- The Civil War.
- Yes, people choose the news they want now, but--

825
00:38:56,926 --> 00:38:59,694
People choose the facts
they want now.

826
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:02,797
<i>So what you've just described
is impossible.</i>

827
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,366
Only if you think an overwhelming
majority of Americans

828
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,835
are preternaturally stupid.

829
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,202
- I do.
- I don't.

830
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:10,404
And if you let me,
I can prove it.

831
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:13,406
You know what you left out
of your <i>sermon</i>?

832
00:39:13,441 --> 00:39:16,744
That America is the only country
on the planet that, since its birth,

833
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:20,848
has said over and over and over
that we can do better.

834
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:22,650
It's part of our DNA.

835
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:26,520
<i>People will want the news
if you give it to them with integrity.</i>

836
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:29,488
Not everybody,
not even a lot of people-- 5%.

837
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:32,859
And 5% more of anything is what
makes the difference in this country.

838
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:35,528
So we can do better.

839
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:40,900
What?

840
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:43,770
I'm thinking.

841
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:49,541
Yeah, that whole speech
did nothing for me.

842
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:02,653
- I'd like to talk to Don.
- Are you sure?

843
00:40:04,122 --> 00:40:05,756
Right there.

844
00:40:08,927 --> 00:40:10,327
Excuse me.

845
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,763
I don't mind if you sit
somewhere and observe,

846
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:14,865
but I mind you doing
anything else.

847
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,000
You got it, but I just got
a call from a source.

848
00:40:17,034 --> 00:40:18,835
What kind of source?

849
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:21,771
I can't tell you much except that
he's an engineer with BP in London.

850
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:24,808
He says he's sitting in meetings where
they don't know how to cap the well.

851
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:28,611
- Who's the source?
- Can't tell you.

852
00:40:28,645 --> 00:40:30,847
- Ahem, anything else?
- A lot.

853
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:32,682
I got two pages of notes
from my conversation with--

854
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:35,550
- Oh, great.
- Okay. Yeah.

855
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,294
Thanks for calling back.

856
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,535
Yeah.

857
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:56,704
<i>Now I'd like you
to listen to these words</i>

858
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,339
which were written
500 years ago

859
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,342
by Don Miguel de Cervantes:

860
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:05,045
"Hear me now, O thou bleak
and unbearable world.

861
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,848
<i>Thou art base
and debauched as can be.</i>

862
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,684
But a knight with his banners
all bravely unfurled

863
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:15,588
now hurls down
his gauntlet to thee!"

864
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:19,993
That was <i>Don Quixote</i>.

865
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:23,829
Those words were written
45 years ago

866
00:41:23,864 --> 00:41:25,597
by the lyricist
for "Man of La Mancha."

867
00:41:25,632 --> 00:41:27,166
Didn't think you'd know that,

868
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,001
but the point's still the same--
it's time for Don Quixote!

869
00:41:29,035 --> 00:41:31,737
- <i>You think I'm him?</i>
- No, I think I'm him. You're his horse.

870
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:34,006
- He rode a donkey.
- Well, I can't help you there.

871
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,441
- I have to write my script.
- I'll write it for you.

872
00:41:36,476 --> 00:41:39,410
"The volcanic eruption in Iceland
is believed to have started on March 20th

873
00:41:39,444 --> 00:41:41,846
and has led to a worldwide
transportation disaster.

874
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:43,114
The suspension of air traffic

875
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,449
was in no way caused
by America, which I love.

876
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:46,851
You have to believe me."

877
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:48,953
You want me in the same
shouting match as everybody else?

878
00:41:48,988 --> 00:41:52,690
- I want you to not apologize for saying something--
- All right!

879
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:54,391
You got yourself
in the shouting match

880
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,794
when you took vertigo meds
and I'd have you winning it.

881
00:41:56,828 --> 00:41:58,428
And what does winning
look like to you?

882
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:00,798
Reclaiming the Fourth Estate.

883
00:42:00,832 --> 00:42:04,401
Reclaiming journalism
as an honorable profession.

884
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,736
A nightly newscast
that informs a debate

885
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,738
worthy of a great nation.

886
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:13,309
Civility, respect, and a return
to what's important.

887
00:42:13,343 --> 00:42:16,345
The death of bitchiness,
the death of gossip and voyeurism.

888
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,848
Speaking truth to stupid.

889
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,382
No demographic sweet spot.

890
00:42:20,417 --> 00:42:23,319
A place where we all
come together.

891
00:42:25,354 --> 00:42:26,855
We're coming
to a tipping point.

892
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,023
I know you know that.

893
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:30,158
There's gonna be
a huge conversation.

894
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:32,360
<i>Is government
an instrument of good</i>

895
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:35,030
or is it every man for himself?

896
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:37,299
Is there something bigger
we want to reach for

897
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:41,135
or is self-interest
our basic resting pulse?

898
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:43,704
You and I have a chance
to be among the few people

899
00:42:43,738 --> 00:42:46,006
who can frame that debate.

900
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:51,879
- That's-- It's...
- Quixotic?

901
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:55,382
- Don.
- Jesus Christ, we're on it, okay, Jimmy Olsen?

902
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:57,984
We've got 55 seconds for a phoner with
the Coast Guard liaison.

903
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:00,153
That's not nearly enough
and you're chasing the wrong story.

904
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,021
- Oh, brother.
- Listen, Halliburton was the contractor

905
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:03,356
on this special type
of concrete--

906
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,192
Seriously,
you're being disruptive now.

907
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:10,330
Hey, how happy
is Charlie Skinner gonna be

908
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:11,664
when I phone this over to CBS

909
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,232
<i>and he finds out
you had it first?</i>

910
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:14,632
All right, that's it.
Get the fuck out.

911
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,903
Okay.
You're right.

912
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:19,404
Elevator's this way?

913
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:24,609
God damn it.

914
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,645
- What?
- I'm sorry to interrupt.

915
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,113
Can I talk to Mac
for just a second?

916
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:30,314
<i>Your guy here
is a pain in the ass.</i>

917
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:32,383
An oil well exploded
in the Gulf of Mexico.

918
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:34,151
The Coast Guard's searching
for missing crew members.

919
00:43:34,186 --> 00:43:36,053
- I'll fill you in at the 6:00 rundown.
- <i>There's more.</i>

920
00:43:36,088 --> 00:43:38,022
- He doesn't need to hear this right now.
- Let's go outside.

921
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:39,991
No, if Don doesn't want me to hear it,
I'd like to hear it.

922
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:42,960
- Oh, blow me.
- I want you to not use that language in front of women

923
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,928
and to forever not suggest
that image to me.

924
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:46,296
What's on your mind?
Who are you?

925
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:48,698
- Jim Harper, my senior producer.
- Senior?

926
00:43:48,732 --> 00:43:50,867
- Is he old enough to drive at night?
- What happened?

927
00:43:50,902 --> 00:43:52,668
Two calls within five minutes
of each other.

928
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,905
The first one was from a friend of mine
at BP in London saying

929
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:57,340
he's sitting in meetings where
they don't know how to cap the well.

930
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,442
- Jesus.
- The oil is still spilling?

931
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:00,943
Yeah, at a pretty
alarming rate.

932
00:44:00,977 --> 00:44:03,845
The first estimate was
about 10,000 gallons an hour.

933
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,181
My guy says
it's closer to 100,000

934
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,017
and could get as high
as a quarter of a million.

935
00:44:08,051 --> 00:44:09,751
Why is this well different
from other wells?

936
00:44:09,786 --> 00:44:11,553
The depth.

937
00:44:11,587 --> 00:44:13,422
I need one of your staffers.

938
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:14,957
He's-- I don't
know his name.

939
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,658
He sits in the back.
He's-- he's the one with--

940
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:20,361
Are you trying to say
the Indian stereotype of an IT guy?

941
00:44:20,396 --> 00:44:21,963
- Yes.
- Punjab!

942
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:24,098
- I don't think that's his name.
- Why not?

943
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:26,000
Punjab's a character
from "Little Orphan Annie."

944
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:27,435
Tell him about the pressure.

945
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:30,371
Uh, Deepwater Horizon
is aptly named.

946
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:32,540
They're drilling at 18,000 feet
below sea level.

947
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,742
- Is that dangerous?
- Take the Grand Canyon, make it three times deeper,

948
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:37,877
fill it with water,
and poke a hole in the bottom.

949
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:40,747
You can't just yank the pin out of the planet,
and that's what's happened.

950
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:42,515
How do you know all this?
You're the IT guy.

951
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,218
- I'm not the IT guy. I write your blog.
- Are you kidding?

952
00:44:45,253 --> 00:44:47,087
I think we're in the first hours
of a serious story.

953
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,721
- No. I have a blog?
- Not the time.

954
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:51,157
How do you know this stuff?

955
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:53,926
I made a volcano
in primary school.

956
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:56,262
So did I. I didn't know I was
supposed to learn something from it.

957
00:44:56,296 --> 00:44:58,331
- What was the second call?
- My guy at Halliburton.

958
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,999
- What the hell is going on?
- Nothing, Charlie.

959
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,568
- Can we please get back to work?
- A rig exploded in the Gulf?

960
00:45:02,602 --> 00:45:05,770
- It's yellow.
- Not anymore. It just got bumped up to orange.

961
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:08,873
- It's orange.
- Okay, the rig was due to be moved to its next role

962
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:11,642
as a semipermanent production
platform at a new location,

963
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:13,878
and Halliburton was hired
to seal the well with cement.

964
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:15,313
- Who are you?
- Jack something.

965
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:18,283
It's Jim something,
and both of my guys are identifying

966
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:20,685
the failure of the cement's mix
as the cause of the explosion.

967
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,222
But here's the thing-- Halliburton
performed tests on the cement mix,

968
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:27,491
and the tests showed
it was gonna fail.

969
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,759
- Holy Mother.
- Yeah, hang on, Holy Mother.

970
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:31,495
I need to know
who your sources are.

971
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,831
Hey, I don't know you, Scooter.

972
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:37,367
Look, you don't
have to trust me.

973
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,369
She trusts me.
You just have to trust her.

974
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,805
Ha, try another strategy.
How high up is the guy at BP?

975
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,174
High enough to be in on the meetings,
and I never said it was a guy.

976
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,143
Actually, you did.
Does he have an axe to grind?

977
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,911
- No.
- What about the guy at Halliburton?

978
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:51,780
I didn't say he was a guy,
but we'll call him that.

979
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,248
And he is solid.

980
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,050
You guys have to follow up on this,
all right?

981
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:57,352
You're gonna wanna open
with the Coast Guard search

982
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:58,920
and then pivot
to this because...

983
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,555
- Neal.
- Neal says...

984
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:02,657
It's gonna be the biggest
environmental disaster in history.

985
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,626
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

986
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,129
Can we please get back to work and
send the Hardy Boys to their room?

987
00:46:07,163 --> 00:46:09,263
- Neal, tell them.
- After an explosion like that,

988
00:46:09,297 --> 00:46:10,864
the first thing
that's supposed to happen

989
00:46:10,899 --> 00:46:13,967
is the underwater blowout preventer
should automatically close.

990
00:46:14,002 --> 00:46:16,037
The flames are still
150 feet high,

991
00:46:16,071 --> 00:46:18,105
so that obviously
didn't happen.

992
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,640
Now when they get the fire out,

993
00:46:19,674 --> 00:46:21,142
they're gonna send
a submersible ROV

994
00:46:21,176 --> 00:46:22,676
down there to turn
the preventer on manually,

995
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,379
but my source says
"at that depth with that much pressure,

996
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:29,482
it has to be the mechanics
that failed and not the electronics."

997
00:46:29,517 --> 00:46:32,085
In other words, trying it manually
isn't gonna work either.

998
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:35,155
So they're gonna have to build relief wells
and that's gonna take months.

999
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:36,889
Months of oil spilling
into the Gulf

1000
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:39,192
at a rate of 4.2 million
gallons a day.

1001
00:46:39,226 --> 00:46:41,160
And just for the record,
the Gulf of Mexico

1002
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:44,329
contains 643 quadrillion
gallons of water.

1003
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:45,897
I think you may be
overreacting.

1004
00:46:45,932 --> 00:46:47,499
You are dramatically
underreacting.

1005
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:49,268
I'm the only one who's not
dramatically doing anything.

1006
00:46:49,302 --> 00:46:51,270
In four days,
it'll have spilled as much oil

1007
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:52,704
as the Exxon Valdez.

1008
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:54,673
It's a week before the oil
reaches Louisiana shores,

1009
00:46:54,707 --> 00:46:56,608
three days if the wind shifts.

1010
00:46:56,642 --> 00:46:59,877
- Is the wind gonna shift?
- Only if Louisiana's luck stays exactly the same.

1011
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,246
You've gotta tell him
your sources.

1012
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:05,015
I can't.

1013
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,984
He can't trust you
unless you trust him.

1014
00:47:11,655 --> 00:47:13,623
All right, the necessary people

1015
00:47:13,657 --> 00:47:15,358
go into my office,
close the door.

1016
00:47:15,393 --> 00:47:18,495
- I want Mac as a witness.
- <i>Fine.</i>

1017
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:25,234
The BP engineer
is my college roommate.

1018
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:27,269
He's a junior VP.
He's been there a year.

1019
00:47:27,304 --> 00:47:30,573
And how do I know you're not being
fed misinformation by James O'Keefe

1020
00:47:30,607 --> 00:47:32,774
in the hope that I run
with it and make his day?

1021
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:34,443
Who's your Halliburton guy?

1022
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:39,414
My big sister.

1023
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:42,016
<i>She's got a PhD
in mechanical engineering</i>

1024
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,351
and she voted for McCain.

1025
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:45,620
You're telling me you got
not one but two people

1026
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,156
to roll over on their employers
within five minutes?

1027
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,790
I know, it's just lucky.

1028
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,059
- <i>How often do you get this lucky?</i>
- This is my first time.

1029
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:55,162
Um, it's a search
and rescue operation

1030
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:56,963
in which no one
is going to be rescued

1031
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:59,166
because Michael Phelps with
an outboard motor on his ass

1032
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,769
couldn't outswim that fire,
and you're letting a guy who you just met

1033
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:04,505
and a woman who--
I don't know what the hell--

1034
00:48:04,539 --> 00:48:06,206
spin this into the end
of the world.

1035
00:48:06,241 --> 00:48:07,874
But forget that.

1036
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:09,775
If you're wrong
about Halliburton,

1037
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:11,710
that's the first line
of your bio forever.

1038
00:48:11,745 --> 00:48:14,647
"Isn't this the same guy who said
that Halliburton caused that spill?"

1039
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:17,816
And, by the way, you publically
accuse them of negligent homicide

1040
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:20,119
and you're wrong,
they will take you to court.

1041
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:23,088
<i>They will win and they
will end up owning AWM.</i>

1042
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:24,723
<i>They will have
their own record label.</i>

1043
00:48:24,758 --> 00:48:26,791
<i>They will have theme parks.</i>

1044
00:48:33,932 --> 00:48:35,333
Let's throw out the rundown.

1045
00:48:35,368 --> 00:48:37,969
- Attaboy.
- This is out of control.

1046
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:39,804
We're throwing out the rundown.

1047
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:42,606
Gary, see if you can get me
a spokesman from BP on the phone.

1048
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:44,375
- Get me anything--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going?

1049
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:45,876
I was told to put
together a new show.

1050
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,744
Guys, can I have
your attention?

1051
00:48:47,779 --> 00:48:49,980
I'm sorry if I've been
a little inaccessible

1052
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:53,083
or terse lately
or for several years,

1053
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,485
but if I could just see
a show of hands--

1054
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,654
who's going
with Don to 10:00?

1055
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,529
All right, I appreciate
all the hard work.

1056
00:49:06,564 --> 00:49:08,731
And as a token of that appreciation,
I'm giving you guys

1057
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:11,033
two weeks' paid vacation
starting right now.

1058
00:49:11,068 --> 00:49:13,968
- Hold on. You're gonna have her run the show?
- Yeah.

1059
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:15,571
Don't do this, Will.

1060
00:49:15,605 --> 00:49:17,939
I just offered her
the most humiliating contract

1061
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:19,474
since Antonio got
a loan from Shylock.

1062
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:20,975
She took it.
I don't know what that is, but I like it.

1063
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,245
You're gonna do a full hour
on an environmental story

1064
00:49:23,279 --> 00:49:26,014
and you don't wanna at least wait until there's
film of an oil-covered pelican?

1065
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:27,516
It's not just
an environmental story.

1066
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,350
Everywhere I look,
people are dressed up in costume,

1067
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:31,352
screaming about
how bad government is.

1068
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,921
- What's your position?
- That people should know what they're screaming about.

1069
00:49:33,955 --> 00:49:35,789
Are you ready to go
on television and say

1070
00:49:35,824 --> 00:49:37,791
that this well wouldn't have blown up
if there had been more government oversight?

1071
00:49:37,826 --> 00:49:39,427
I'll give you my next paycheck
if it doesn't turn out

1072
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,896
that some department was defunded
or some industry was deregulated.

1073
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:44,765
He'll do it, too.

1074
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,935
I didn't buy any of that bullshit
you said in my office,

1075
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:50,303
but can you start
two weeks early?

1076
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:51,838
You plainly bought it a lot,
and yes.

1077
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:54,207
- I didn't buy it at all, and go.
- Okay.

1078
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,576
But it's obvious now that you
ate it up with a soup ladle.

1079
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:58,378
- Just go.
- Who's my booker?

1080
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,380
- Right here.
- Jim's gonna tell you who to line up.

1081
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,348
Everybody out who doesn't
need to be here.

1082
00:50:02,382 --> 00:50:03,749
Wait!

1083
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,085
Seriously, though,
I have a blog?

1084
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,955
- Now!
- Yeah. It's Gary Cooper from <i>News Night</i>.

1085
00:50:09,989 --> 00:50:12,691
I'm good. I need to speak to someone
about recent legislation.

1086
00:50:12,726 --> 00:50:14,493
You go out around 8:20.

1087
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:16,862
We could send a crew and do that
right from the Coast Guard station.

1088
00:50:16,896 --> 00:50:19,464
Hello, this is Jim Harper. I'm the senior
producer with <i>News Night</i> on Atlantis,

1089
00:50:19,498 --> 00:50:22,133
and we're looking into a story about
the BP Deepwater Horizon rig

1090
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:23,268
that just exploded in the Gulf.

1091
00:50:23,302 --> 00:50:24,669
This is Margaret Jordan
from <i>News Night</i>.

1092
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:26,437
We're looking for someone
from the EPA to comment

1093
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:28,439
on the explosion
at Deepwater Horizon.

1094
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:30,408
Take him to our studio
in New Orleans.

1095
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:33,410
I'm so sorry.
Can I put you on hold? Okay.

1096
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:35,912
Hi, Mike. It's Tess Westin
from <i>News Night</i>.

1097
00:50:35,946 --> 00:50:37,681
We're doing a whole hour
on the explosion.

1098
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:39,549
I really need
your input on this.

1099
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:42,018
You're on speaker with me,
Mackenzie McHale and...

1100
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,620
- Jim Harper.
- Jim Harper.

1101
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:44,788
Margaret.

1102
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:46,055
- Yeah.
- Can you do me a favor?

1103
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,057
There's a government agency
called the MMA,

1104
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,625
the Minerals Management Agency.

1105
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,026
They have some kind of oversight
over offshore drilling.

1106
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,227
I don't know
anything about them.

1107
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:53,562
- Can you write me a short memo?
- Sure.

1108
00:50:53,597 --> 00:50:54,930
- I'll do it.
- I can do it.

1109
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,165
You're not the only one
with loyalty.

1110
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,300
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.

1111
00:50:57,334 --> 00:50:59,067
- I can do this.
- <i>Can you do this?</i>

1112
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:00,636
- You can't just look it up on Wikipedia, Maggie.
- He's right.

1113
00:51:00,671 --> 00:51:02,571
- I wasn't going to.
- She's Will's assistant.

1114
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:04,540
- I'm an associate producer.
- Since when?

1115
00:51:04,574 --> 00:51:06,040
- About two hours ago.
- That's great.

1116
00:51:06,074 --> 00:51:07,309
And you're wasting my time.

1117
00:51:07,343 --> 00:51:08,777
You guys duke it out
over who my boss is,

1118
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:10,111
but I'd like to get
this one thing right.

1119
00:51:10,145 --> 00:51:11,613
Knock it out of the park.

1120
00:51:12,948 --> 00:51:15,850
I need a geologist.
Don, who's our go-to geologist?

1121
00:51:15,884 --> 00:51:17,552
Our go-to geologist?

1122
00:51:17,586 --> 00:51:20,087
There's not a lot
of breaking news in geology.

1123
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:21,955
Dr. James Morris at MIT

1124
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:23,857
and Dr. Marvin Hasbrook
at Stanford.

1125
00:51:23,891 --> 00:51:26,059
Whoever answers
the phone first.

1126
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:29,596
Is the EPA ready to comment?

1127
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:31,465
We're waiting
for a comment from BP.

1128
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:35,336
Are you able to get
the White House on the phone?

1129
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:37,103
- Yeah.
- Then do it.

1130
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:39,339
Halliburton is in it, Sean.
That ship has sailed.

1131
00:51:39,373 --> 00:51:41,441
<i>Studio 1-A,
this is Broadcast Center.</i>

1132
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:44,076
- <i>You're up on router 3.</i>
- Copy that, Center. Router 3.

1133
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,246
No, throw out all the remotes.
It's a whole new rundown.

1134
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:17,441
Thank you.

1135
00:52:35,593 --> 00:52:37,261
Joey, these three
are confirmed,

1136
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:38,728
but you should build all five.

1137
00:52:38,763 --> 00:52:41,631
Got it.

1138
00:52:49,472 --> 00:52:50,940
Will, we've confirmed
these three guests.

1139
00:52:50,974 --> 00:52:52,508
We're waiting on two others.

1140
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:03,285
Two minutes.

1141
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:04,886
Who's our wardrobe supervisor?

1142
00:53:04,921 --> 00:53:06,121
- We don't have one.
- Get one.

1143
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:08,523
Charcoal gray,
navy blue, and black.

1144
00:53:08,557 --> 00:53:10,491
Zegna, Armani, Hugo Boss.

1145
00:53:10,526 --> 00:53:13,061
- He's not gonna look like an elite Northeastern prick?
- <i>He is.</i>

1146
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:15,930
- Let's make that sexy again.
- Was it ever sexy?

1147
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:17,865
Ask the Kennedy brothers.
Oh, Will.

1148
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,067
Don't talk to me unless
you absolutely have to, all right?

1149
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:22,169
I absolutely have to.
I thought this would be a good time

1150
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:23,638
to get a couple
of things straight.

1151
00:53:23,672 --> 00:53:25,372
I'm on TV in 90 seconds.

1152
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:27,041
I don't think this is a good time to
get a couple of things straight.

1153
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:28,576
That's funny,
because I think it's the best time

1154
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:29,644
to get a couple
of things straight.

1155
00:53:29,678 --> 00:53:30,911
Can people hear me in there?

1156
00:53:30,945 --> 00:53:32,345
Not yet.
Now they can.

1157
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:33,447
<i>Take me off.</i>

1158
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:35,649
<i>So I did a terrible thing</i>

1159
00:53:35,683 --> 00:53:37,517
and I don't expect you
to forgive me.

1160
00:53:37,552 --> 00:53:40,554
- Take me off.
- You've got my contract, but the thing you have to know

1161
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:43,790
is that between 8:00 and 9:00,
you are completely mine.

1162
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:46,559
For an hour,
five times a week I own you.

1163
00:53:46,593 --> 00:53:50,028
But in my case, it's for your own good
and for the good of all.

1164
00:53:50,063 --> 00:53:52,832
Say "I understand" so I can
get these guys a sound level.

1165
00:53:52,866 --> 00:53:54,366
I don't see it
working that way.

1166
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,301
- You don't?
- No.

1167
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:58,270
Okay.

1168
00:53:58,304 --> 00:54:00,305
- Where's my graphics producer?
- <i>Right here.</i>

1169
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:02,007
I'm Mackenzie.
What's your name?

1170
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,908
- 60 seconds.
<i>- Jo-- Joey.</i>

1171
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:06,778
- Can I get some quiet?
- Joey, could I have your seat for just a second?

1172
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:10,147
Yes, ma'am.

1173
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:14,452
There you go.
Show that to Will, please.

1174
00:54:14,487 --> 00:54:16,420
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1175
00:54:16,455 --> 00:54:18,522
Will, check out
your preview screen.

1176
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:23,226
<i>Get it off there!</i>

1177
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,061
- <i>Say you understand.</i>
- <i>30 seconds.</i>

1178
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:28,031
Someone's gonna spill coffee on a button
and broadcast that thing.

1179
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:30,801
- Get it off.
- I've got a one-week contract. I don't have a lot to lose.

1180
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,936
I'm just glad nobody's invented
a way to digitally store images

1181
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:35,204
and upload them onto a free website
where anyone can see them.

1182
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,006
Has someone invented a way
to digitally store images?

1183
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,774
YouTube!
YouTube!

1184
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:41,343
Oh, now you're just the crazy guy
shouting "YouTube!"

1185
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,513
- Oh, God--
- Just say you understand.

1186
00:54:43,547 --> 00:54:45,548
- I understand!
- Good!

1187
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,984
You warmed up?
You wanna screw around some more?

1188
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,118
- I'm good!
- <i>10.</i>

1189
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,285
<i>There's no script.</i>

<i>There's nothing

1191
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:53,655
Nothing on the prompter

1192
00:54:53,689 --> 00:54:55,724
<i>And rolling.</i>

00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:19,079
to hit the Gulf of Mexico
since Hurricane Katrina

1199
00:55:19,113 --> 00:55:21,916
and the biggest environmental
catastrophe to stain our shores

1200
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:24,317
since the crash
of the Exxon Valdez.

1201
00:55:24,352 --> 00:55:27,320
An oil rig in the Gulf,
British Petroleum's Deepwater Horizon

1202
00:55:27,355 --> 00:55:29,423
50 miles off Venice, Louisiana,

1203
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:33,026
exploded into flames
shortly after 2:00 PM Eastern time.

1204
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:36,196
Seven crew members have been
evacuated to an area hospital

1205
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,997
where they remain
in critical condition,

1206
00:55:38,032 --> 00:55:39,665
and the Coast Guard
is in the fifth hour

1207
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:41,167
- of a search and rescue mission...
- Tape 2 up.

1208
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:44,170
In the hope of finding 11 crew members
still unaccounted for.

1209
00:55:44,204 --> 00:55:46,539
Our coverage begins
with Sherrie Stone

1210
00:55:46,573 --> 00:55:48,207
at the US Coast Guard Station
in Baton Rouge.

1211
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:50,609
- Sherrie?
- Yes, Will, the Coast Guard got...

1212
00:55:50,643 --> 00:55:52,278
<i>All right, you'll be coming back</i>

1213
00:55:52,312 --> 00:55:55,280
to Rear Admiral Loretta Hill
of the Coast Guard.

1214
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:57,282
Just right after
3:00 PM Eastern time...

1215
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,750
The missing men may be
only the tip of this tragedy.

1216
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:03,921
ACN has learned exclusively
that senior level officials inside BP

1217
00:56:03,956 --> 00:56:06,157
are scrambling to figure out
a way to cap the well,

1218
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:09,026
which, three and a half miles
below the surface of the Gulf,

1219
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,595
is pouring oil into the sea
at a rate of 125,000...

1220
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:14,164
I'm sure you'd like to see some kind of
statement on the screen.

1221
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:15,699
"Our thoughts and prayers

1222
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,634
are with the families
of the missing crew members."

1223
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:20,304
I can help you out with that,
but I'll also need a statement

1224
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:23,474
that says at this hour you don't
know how to cap the well.

1225
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,809
You have about 25 minutes.

1226
00:56:27,377 --> 00:56:28,811
<i>Dr. Morris, this is New York.</i>

1227
00:56:28,845 --> 00:56:30,246
Can you hear me?
Good.

1228
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,715
We'll be coming to you
in about two minutes.

1229
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:35,118
You've got to ask her
why there's no contingency.

1230
00:56:35,152 --> 00:56:37,420
Why is there no contingency?

1231
00:56:37,454 --> 00:56:39,688
Nancy, why are we drilling
three miles underwater

1232
00:56:39,723 --> 00:56:41,157
when we don't have
the technology

1233
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:43,558
to fix the world's
most predictable emergency?

1234
00:56:48,998 --> 00:56:50,365
Jim.

1235
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:51,566
Jim!

1236
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:55,437
Jim. Jim.

1237
00:56:55,471 --> 00:56:57,739
Jim? You have
a hold button.

1238
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:00,341
- Hold, please.
- Jim!

1239
00:57:02,110 --> 00:57:04,178
- You got it?
- I, uh...

1240
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:08,181
- Oh, shit.
- I got it and I think a little bit more.

1241
00:57:09,684 --> 00:57:11,018
- Come with me.
- Okay.

1242
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,486
- Take the pad.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

1243
00:57:13,521 --> 00:57:16,289
Dr. James Morris
of the US Geological Survey

1244
00:57:16,323 --> 00:57:18,792
and Professor of Petroleum
Geology at MIT.

1245
00:57:18,826 --> 00:57:21,427
<i>BP Deepwater Horizon
is engulfed in flames</i>

1246
00:57:21,462 --> 00:57:24,163
and the search continues
for 11 missing crew members.

1247
00:57:24,197 --> 00:57:26,866
We'll be right back.

1248
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:32,171
When we come back,
it'll be Halliburton. Are you ready?

1249
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:34,774
- No statement from BP?
- Don't worry about BP.

1250
00:57:34,808 --> 00:57:38,543
You're going to Halliburton's
spokesperson Dick Warren.

1251
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:42,413
This is beautiful.

1252
00:57:42,447 --> 00:57:46,184
Just sitting here, Charlie.
I'm watching the news.

1253
00:57:49,321 --> 00:57:51,856
Young lady, get on
your Twitter account.

1254
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:54,925
We're doing this
whole broadcast on the fly.

1255
00:57:54,959 --> 00:57:58,595
Will doesn't have a rundown,
it's the EP's first show,

1256
00:57:58,629 --> 00:58:00,197
and she's got the whole thing
in her head.

1257
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:01,932
She's the only one who knows
where we're going next.

1258
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:06,469
It's a feat that requires incredible trust
between the anchor and the EP.

1259
00:58:06,504 --> 00:58:07,971
Say all that.

1260
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:09,872
I can only use 140 characters.

1261
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:12,108
Figure it out.

1262
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:14,010
- We are trying to gather information...
- Sir, please. Please!

1263
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:16,445
As quickly as possibly.
It isn't easy while we're being hounded.

1264
00:58:16,479 --> 00:58:18,748
- Let's just take a breath.
- I'm breathing fine.

1265
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:20,416
Zoneseal 2000.

1266
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:24,120
Your company was hired to provide
Zoneseal 2000 and SCR-100,

1267
00:58:24,154 --> 00:58:27,655
a synthetic, cement-like substance
meant to seal off the well-- Yes or no?

1268
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,759
- Yes, we were, but now you're saying--
- That's all I was saying.

1269
00:58:30,793 --> 00:58:33,261
Now I'm asking if your company
did tests on the substance

1270
00:58:33,295 --> 00:58:35,597
before installing it at the base
of Deepwater Horizon.

1271
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:38,033
We do exhaustive tests
on everything we manufacture.

1272
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:42,036
Do you have the results of these
exhaustive tests done on Zoneseal 2000?

1273
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,537
Now you're being
unnecessarily flippant.

1274
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:46,107
Look, I am not some college
student you can shout at.

1275
00:58:46,141 --> 00:58:48,109
We're not going to commercial
till he answers your question.

1276
00:58:48,143 --> 00:58:50,444
No, you're the spokesperson
for Halliburton.

1277
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:52,412
And I came on this program
voluntarily.

1278
00:58:52,447 --> 00:58:53,513
I don't have subpoena power.

1279
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:55,282
Everyone comes on this program
voluntarily.

1280
00:58:55,316 --> 00:58:57,618
Understand that this is
all happening fast

1281
00:58:57,652 --> 00:59:00,319
and that this is information
that isn't at our fingertips.

1282
00:59:00,354 --> 00:59:02,355
- You don't have the test results at your fingertips?
<i>- For the moment,</i>

1283
00:59:02,389 --> 00:59:03,823
<i>Halliburton's thoughts
and prayers are with...</i>

1284
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:05,424
All of our thoughts and prayers
are with the missing crew--

1285
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,260
Nobody's thoughts and prayers
are with the fire.

1286
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,694
Good to see you again, Will.

1287
00:59:08,729 --> 00:59:10,930
Sir, aren't the test results
on a computer?

1288
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,665
Are they buried in the middle
of a wheat field?

1289
00:59:12,699 --> 00:59:14,466
- <i>We will make the test results...</i>
- It's about time.

1290
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,801
What's the Minerals
Management Agency?

1291
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:18,436
It's the Minerals Management Service,
the MMS,

1292
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:22,107
and they have 56 inspectors
overseeing 3,500 production facilities

1293
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,577
that operate 35,591 wells
in the Gulf region.

1294
00:59:25,611 --> 00:59:28,446
That's according to the Interior Department,
not Wikipedia.

1295
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,314
56 inspectors for 35,000 wells?

1296
00:59:30,348 --> 00:59:33,251
- It gets better.
- We're out. Back in 90 seconds.

1297
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:35,052
- BP statement?
- Hang on.

1298
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:37,454
Inspections for drilling rigs
are required monthly,

1299
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:39,356
but Deepwater Horizon
was only inspected

1300
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,226
nine times in 2009
and six times in 2008.

1301
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:43,895
- What's coming?
- Hang on.

1302
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:47,230
The last inspection was done
20 days ago by Eric Neal,

1303
00:59:47,265 --> 00:59:50,133
who was sent by himself even though
he had only just started his training

1304
00:59:50,168 --> 00:59:51,802
as a government inspector
of drilling rigs.

1305
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:53,736
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1306
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:56,639
- Is it the BP statement?
- Oh, my God, would somebody hit him with a stun gun?

1307
00:59:56,649 --> 00:59:57,447
<i>30 seconds.</i>

1308
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:59,442
What I wouldn't give to have
a phone hook up with this guy.

1309
00:59:59,476 --> 01:00:00,877
- <i>You do.</i>
- What?

1310
01:00:00,912 --> 01:00:02,912
He's on hold.
It's this blinking light.

1311
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:06,882
Maggie...
I am taking you shopping!

1312
01:00:06,917 --> 01:00:08,517
- Will, listen up.
- Phone graphic: Eric Neal.

1313
01:00:08,551 --> 01:00:10,152
- <i>Minerals Management is wildly understaffed.</i>
- N-E-A-L.

1314
01:00:10,187 --> 01:00:11,586
- Jesus.
- <i>We've got the guy--</i>

1315
01:00:11,621 --> 01:00:13,856
Give me all the numbers.

1316
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:15,357
- M-me?
- Give him the numbers.

1317
01:00:15,391 --> 01:00:17,926
- Let's go!
- Okay. Uh, 56 inspectors.

1318
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,660
- <i>10 seconds.</i>
- 3,500...

1319
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:25,099
Take it easy with him.
He's gonna be scared to death.

1320
01:00:25,134 --> 01:00:27,368
In three, two...

1321
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:31,306
Welcome back to breaking news.

1322
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,142
The oil rig BP Deepwater Horizon
has exploded into flames

1323
01:00:35,176 --> 01:00:37,377
50 miles off the coast
of Louisiana,

1324
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:40,314
leaving 11 crew members missing
and feared dead.

1325
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:43,183
We're on the phone with Eric Neal
of the Minerals Management Service.

1326
01:00:43,218 --> 01:00:44,852
Thank you for joining us,
Mr. Neal.

1327
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,487
<i>It's good to-- Thank you.</i>

1328
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,422
Can you confirm
that the MMS employs

1329
01:00:48,456 --> 01:00:50,457
56 inspectors
in the Gulf region?

1330
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:51,926
<i>I believe that's correct.</i>

1331
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,563
And the 56 of you
oversee 35,591 wells?

1332
01:00:56,598 --> 01:01:00,934
- <i>I believe that's correct.</i>
- That's 635 wells for each inspector.

1333
01:01:00,968 --> 01:01:03,103
The wells are required
to be inspected once a month.

1334
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:05,204
- Is that correct?
<i>- The drilling wells, yes.</i>

1335
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:07,807
Is it possible with
so few inspectors and so many wells

1336
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:10,977
to properly inspect
each platform as scheduled?

1337
01:01:12,179 --> 01:01:14,514
<i>Our--
Our budget's very limited.</i>

1338
01:01:14,548 --> 01:01:16,549
A single inspector would
have to thoroughly review

1339
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:19,084
two wells a day,
six days a week for a year.

1340
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:20,986
<i>I know.</i>

1341
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:23,856
Would an easy solution be to
have the oil companies themselves

1342
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:25,625
pay for the cost
of a proper inspection?

1343
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:28,194
<i>Isn't that what
car owners have to do?</i>

1344
01:01:28,228 --> 01:01:32,664
<i>Well, that isn't my field of expertise.</i>

1345
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:34,566
- Statement from BP.
- Right here.

1346
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,100
<i>Mr. Neal, you were sent</i>

1347
01:01:36,135 --> 01:01:38,870
to inspect Deepwater Horizon
19 days ago--

1348
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,405
April 1st, is that right?

1349
01:01:40,439 --> 01:01:42,641
<i>I was, yes.</i>

1350
01:01:42,675 --> 01:01:45,477
Were you aware that dating
back to September 2001,

1351
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:47,878
Deepwater Horizon
had shown five red flags

1352
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,614
<i>or incidents of noncompliance?</i>

1353
01:01:50,649 --> 01:01:53,250
<i>Um, I'm not sure
I'm authorized to speak about that.</i>

1354
01:01:53,285 --> 01:01:55,719
I understand.
I only have two more questions.

1355
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:58,121
Prior to your inspection
of the rig on April 1st,

1356
01:01:58,156 --> 01:02:01,958
<i>how many inspections had you
done of offshore oil drilling rigs?</i>

1357
01:02:03,027 --> 01:02:05,295
- <i>None.</i>
- <i>None?</i>

1358
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:09,265
- <i>Except in training.</i>
- And how long have you been in training?

1359
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,935
- <i>Four months.</i>
- Thank you very much.

1360
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,604
That was Eric Neal with the
Minerals Management Service.

1361
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:17,708
- We have the statement.
- <i>We now have a statement from BP.</i>

1362
01:02:17,742 --> 01:02:19,575
<i>We'll put it up
on the screen for you.</i>

1363
01:02:19,609 --> 01:02:21,911
"The thoughts and prayers--"

1364
01:02:21,945 --> 01:02:23,512
"The thoughts and prayers
of Tony Hayward

1365
01:02:23,546 --> 01:02:25,881
and everyone at BP are with
the missing crew members

1366
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:28,650
of the BP Deepwater Horizon
and their families.

1367
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:30,452
We are looking at
every possible solution

1368
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:31,921
to the problem
of capping the well

1369
01:02:31,955 --> 01:02:34,389
and will, of course,
offer our complete assistance

1370
01:02:34,424 --> 01:02:36,891
to the various US agencies
involved in repairing

1371
01:02:36,926 --> 01:02:40,561
and cleaning up the damage done
by this terrible accident."

1372
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,765
So, glass half-full.

1373
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:46,300
They're offering
to help clean up.

1374
01:02:48,738 --> 01:02:50,238
This is obviously
just beginning.

1375
01:02:50,272 --> 01:02:52,439
We'll be bringing you more
as this story develops.

1376
01:02:52,473 --> 01:02:54,074
Terry Smith
is coming up right now

1377
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:56,043
<i>with the </i>Capitol Report
<i>from Washington.</i>

1378
01:02:56,077 --> 01:02:57,945
I'm Will McAvoy.
Good night.

1379
01:03:35,347 --> 01:03:37,783
<i>Did the White House call?</i>

1380
01:03:37,817 --> 01:03:40,651
Gibbs wants to know what we know
and how we know it.

1381
01:03:40,685 --> 01:03:42,419
We're not giving up
the new guy.

1382
01:03:42,453 --> 01:03:45,355
Hey, the news alert's at red.

1383
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,792
- We got it right.
- We got the spill right.

1384
01:03:47,826 --> 01:03:49,593
We don't know what we're doing
with Halliburton.

1385
01:03:49,627 --> 01:03:51,561
- We don't know what's gonna happen--
- God, you're a pussy.

1386
01:03:51,596 --> 01:03:55,398
- You know, I'm just being--
- And it's not like you said the sorority girl

1387
01:03:55,432 --> 01:03:58,268
is responsible for setting
the hemisphere on fire.

1388
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,435
Give the Internet an hour.

1389
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,237
That's exactly
what it'll say we said.

1390
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:04,974
- I'm too old to be governed by fear of dumb people.
- I'm not.

1391
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,644
You're older than you think.

1392
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:11,847
Don't learn that the hard way.

1393
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,883
You didn't bring her in
to right the ship.

1394
01:04:14,918 --> 01:04:17,319
You brought her in
to build a new one.

1395
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,821
You knew Don
would go with Elliot.

1396
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,624
- You orchestrated the whole thing.
- Yeah.

1397
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,860
For a long time now,
I badly wanted to watch

1398
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,094
the news on my TV at night.

1399
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,065
Then it occurred to me--
I run a news division.

1400
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:33,968
She's indifferent to ratings,
competition,

1401
01:04:34,002 --> 01:04:36,871
corporate concerns, and,
generally speaking, consequences.

1402
01:04:36,905 --> 01:04:39,406
Good, 'cause you just
described my job.

1403
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:41,843
I'm Don Quixote,
you can be Sancho,

1404
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:44,744
she'll be Dulcinea,
and everyone out there is the horse.

1405
01:04:44,778 --> 01:04:47,547
Donkey. How did you know
about that conversation?

1406
01:04:47,581 --> 01:04:49,182
I know everything.

1407
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:52,986
Anchors having an opinion
isn't a new phenomenon.

1408
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,956
Murrow had one and that
was the end of McCarthy.

1409
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:58,091
Cronkite had one and that
was the end of Vietnam.

1410
01:04:58,125 --> 01:05:01,727
- I'm not those guys.
- I'm betting all my money on you're wrong.

1411
01:05:01,761 --> 01:05:03,762
You know what, kiddo?

1412
01:05:03,796 --> 01:05:06,332
In the old days
of about 10 minutes ago,

1413
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:08,234
we did the news well.

1414
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:12,037
You know how?
We just decided to.

1415
01:05:20,379 --> 01:05:22,413
<i>Will...</i>

1416
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:27,018
I fucking loved what
you said at Northwestern,

1417
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:30,221
and that's why
I brought her here.

1418
01:05:42,934 --> 01:05:45,302
<i>Neal.</i>

1419
01:05:45,336 --> 01:05:49,505
- Welcome to the show, mate.
- Thanks for everything. Take care.

1420
01:05:49,539 --> 01:05:51,007
- Hey, good show.
- Good show.

1421
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:52,408
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

1422
01:05:52,442 --> 01:05:54,777
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>
- <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

1423
01:06:03,786 --> 01:06:05,887
- Excuse me. Hey.
- Oh, hi.

1424
01:06:05,922 --> 01:06:09,791
I didn't have time before
to say great job.

1425
01:06:09,825 --> 01:06:11,960
Are you kidding?
You were like Batman.

1426
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:13,161
I am, actually.

1427
01:06:13,195 --> 01:06:14,996
I felt like the cape
was a little campy,

1428
01:06:15,031 --> 01:06:17,065
but I still have the car
and the utility belt.

1429
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:20,367
- Right.
- Yeah.

1430
01:06:20,402 --> 01:06:23,103
I shouldn't... say things.

1431
01:06:23,138 --> 01:06:25,039
Well, that was huge.

1432
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:26,874
- I just answered my phone.
- Well--

1433
01:06:26,909 --> 01:06:29,911
Don, we got off
on the wrong foot.

1434
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:31,979
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I appreciate that.

1435
01:06:32,013 --> 01:06:34,582
Another night when I haven't spent the day
getting my ass kicked, okay?

1436
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,115
You got it.

1437
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:39,052
- Are your folks down in the lobby?
- Yeah.

1438
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:40,854
How about I come down
and say hi?

1439
01:06:40,888 --> 01:06:42,823
We get to meet.
I'll apologize in person.

1440
01:06:42,857 --> 01:06:44,591
I'll come back upstairs
for a couple of minutes

1441
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,159
so it looks like I'm working.

1442
01:06:46,193 --> 01:06:48,194
You call me when
you're done with dinner.

1443
01:06:48,228 --> 01:06:49,863
It's a compromise.

1444
01:06:51,598 --> 01:06:53,532
You!

1445
01:06:59,673 --> 01:07:01,373
Your name is Margaret Jordan.

1446
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:05,644
Yes, it is.

1447
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:08,713
That was a good show, Will.

1448
01:07:10,649 --> 01:07:12,650
Mackenzie, I was wrong,
you were right.

1449
01:07:13,586 --> 01:07:15,553
What did everybody else run?

1450
01:07:17,456 --> 01:07:19,090
What did they run, Don?

1451
01:07:19,124 --> 01:07:23,327
Flights resumed in Europe and the
iPhone prototype that was left at a bar.

1452
01:07:23,362 --> 01:07:25,328
They all closed with the oil rig,
though.

1453
01:07:25,363 --> 01:07:28,699
- Spill?
- Search and rescue.

1454
01:07:35,439 --> 01:07:37,841
We should go.

1455
01:07:37,876 --> 01:07:40,242
Good night, guys.

1456
01:07:41,912 --> 01:07:43,813
Night.

1457
01:07:56,659 --> 01:07:58,226
I don't know
what you're miming.

1458
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,228
Just...

1459
01:08:01,731 --> 01:08:04,065
You're fine.

1460
01:08:25,587 --> 01:08:27,687
Can I talk to you a second?

1461
01:08:27,721 --> 01:08:29,789
8:00 to 9:00 is over.

1462
01:08:33,293 --> 01:08:36,128
I understand.
I just wanted to mention something.

1463
01:08:36,163 --> 01:08:39,398
Hang on. Enough of this shit
about being disengaged.

1464
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:43,836
Guys, great job tonight.

1465
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:46,638
These things are done by teams,
and I've got the best team in television.

1466
01:08:46,673 --> 01:08:48,407
I'm gonna make sure
each and every one of you

1467
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:50,609
knows how important
you are to me.

1468
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:54,613
- This isn't our control room.
- No.

1469
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:56,648
Then screw it.

1470
01:08:59,586 --> 01:09:01,553
Will.

1471
01:09:04,423 --> 01:09:07,325
You won't remember this,
but the first time

1472
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,760
you met my parents,
you had flowers for my mother.

1473
01:09:10,795 --> 01:09:12,629
You took my father
to an Orioles game

1474
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:14,598
and then you met us for dinner.

1475
01:09:14,632 --> 01:09:16,500
And I wanted to tell you...

1476
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:22,038
that you were perfect.

1477
01:09:23,608 --> 01:09:26,041
Like I said, you wouldn't remember,
but I wanted to thank you--

1478
01:09:26,076 --> 01:09:29,712
The Orioles won 4-3 on a walk-off double
from Miguel Tejada

1479
01:09:29,746 --> 01:09:31,247
with runners
on first and third.

1480
01:09:31,281 --> 01:09:34,217
Your father ordered a beer
and I ordered a Diet Coke.

1481
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:36,785
And he said, "McAvoy,
you're a Republican nitwit

1482
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:38,887
and every word you've ever said
or written about China

1483
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:41,456
is incomprehensible bollocks.

1484
01:09:41,491 --> 01:09:43,758
But for reasons
passing understanding,

1485
01:09:43,792 --> 01:09:46,027
my Mackenzie seems to be
in love with you.

1486
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:47,862
So you can have a pint
on a hot summer's day

1487
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:50,832
without earning
my disapproval."

1488
01:09:50,866 --> 01:09:53,001
We ended up having three.

1489
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:01,408
You two idiots were drunk
when you met us for dinner?

1490
01:10:01,443 --> 01:10:04,645
Yeah.

1491
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,549
Your dad's feeling all right?

1492
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:12,218
Charlie says you're physically
and mentally exhausted.

1493
01:10:13,854 --> 01:10:15,588
I've been exhausted
since I was 30.

1494
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,490
Everybody's exhausted.

01:10:20,461 --> 01:10:22,562
I just wanted to come back
and be in a newsroom.

1496
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:27,733
Well, this one's
yours for a week.

1497
01:10:27,768 --> 01:10:30,302
- Good show tonight.
- You, too.

1498
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,075
It wasn't vertigo medicine.

1499
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:39,010
I thought I saw you
in the audience.

1500
01:10:39,045 --> 01:10:40,412
That's how I got flustered.

1501
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:43,582
I thought I saw you,
but it turned out to be someone else.

1502
01:10:45,584 --> 01:10:47,718
No, wait.

1503
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:28,117
