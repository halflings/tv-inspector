1
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,671
Climate controlled stacks,
energy efficient,

2
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
now mind you
the whole collection

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,320
could probably fit on a Kindle,

4
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,714
but at least
the cadets will have

5
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
another place to
get out of the rain.

6
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,840
Did you have much
input on the design?

7
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,109
I approved the blue prints.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,839
If something's gonna
have my name on it,

9
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,553
I want to make damn sure
they build it right.

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,315
I think my husband fancies
himself a bit of an architect.

11
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,272
Well, Jefferson
designed Monticello...

12
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,953
He also fucked his slaves.

13
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,474
Luckily I don't have any,

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,916
so that particular temptation
hasn't presented itself.

15
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,636
The Sentinel, South Carolina's
premiere military college.

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,952
They taught me the values
of honor, duty and respect.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,713
They also hazed me,
tried to break me,

18
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,553
and senior year,
nearly expelled me

19
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,350
when I volunteered for a Senate
race and my studies suffered.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,114
But that didn't stop them
from soliciting a hefty sum

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,431
for their new library
30 years later.

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,478
How quickly poor grades
are forgotten

23
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,478
in the shadow of
power and wealth.

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,031
Your drink is only about half
as full as it should be, Frank.

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,713
Are you trying to get me drunk?

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,032
Drunk, passed out in the gutter
so I can steal your wife.

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,991
Did you get
the email about the Riflemen?

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,116
What email?

29
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,554
From my office.
About the invitations.

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,034
I was hoping
they would be here.

31
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,436
I'll check the list, but I
don't remember any email...

32
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,716
Oh, not a problem.
I was just wondering.

33
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,314
Shit, Frank, I'm sorry...

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,675
Don't you sweat
it for a second.

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,672
In fact, here's how you
can make it up to me,

36
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,672
freshen my drink.
That I can do.

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,518
Congratulations, Congressman.

38
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,320
Remy, nice to see you here.

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,721
Gerry and all the folks at
SanCorp give you their regards.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,439
Well, I'm sorry
they couldn't make it.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,556
Where's Claire?

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,553
She's here somewhere,
fending off admirers.

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,719
SanCorp was very disappointed
she turned down their donation.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,995
I can imagine.

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,278
And they're also concerned about
Peter Russo running for governor.

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,919
Now, how do you
know about that?

47
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,397
Three-quarters of Pennsylvania sits
on top of the Marcellus Shale.

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,437
If I can't find out who's
running for governor,

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,440
I don't deserve a dime of
what they're paying me.

50
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,591
This Watershed Bill
Russo sponsors

51
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,955
places a lot of
restrictions on drilling...

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,238
Remy, Congress is in recess and
this weekend is not about work.

53
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,437
I apologize,
you are absolutely right.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,159
Is SanCorp your only account?

55
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,999
I have plenty.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,759
But my other clients didn't pay

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,553
for your library, or my
plane ticket down here.

58
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,472
Yes,
nice little junket for you.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,478
I do hope you're
taking in the sights.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,153
This isn't my first
trip to Charleston.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,119
But I'll bet it's your first
time not as my Press Secretary.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,270
It is.

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,041
Who else you have coming in?

64
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,032
I didn't want to
pack tonight too much.

65
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,759
You know,
these receptions are usually

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,559
just for the money people,
like yourself.

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,436
<i>Normally, this is
where I would start</i>

68
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,193
<i>to drone on about the
Sentinel's history,</i>

69
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,033
<i>its philosophy, its
yadda, yadda, yadda...</i>

70
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,711
<i>But I'm gonna save that for
my big speech tomorrow,</i>

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,474
<i>and that way I'm not gonna
bore y'all to tears twice.</i>

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,713
<i>Tonight we're
gonna turn it over</i>

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,433
<i>to a man who
needs no introduction,</i>

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,712
<i>'cause we all know what
a son of a bitch he is.</i>

75
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,790
<i>Seriously, though,</i>

76
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,997
<i>Frank Underwood exemplifies
all the virtues</i>

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,271
<i>we try to instill
in our graduates.</i>

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,480
<i>We're so proud to call
you an alumnus, Frank,</i>

79
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,991
<i>and to have your name as a
permanent fixture on our campus.</i>

80
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,995
<i>Congressman Frank Underwood.</i>

81
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
<i>Thank you, President Higgins.</i>

82
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,399
<i>I first want to thank
SanCorp Industries</i>

83
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,752
<i>for providing the funds to
make the library possible.</i>

84
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,032
<i>When I matriculated
here as a young cadet,</i>

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,635
<i>Jimmy Carter had just
been elected President.</i>

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,915
<i>After I graduated,</i>

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,600
<i>I wished that I could have had
another four years, just like Jimmy.</i>

88
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,391
<i>Well,
neither of us got our wish,</i>

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,751
<i>but I left this campus
with fond memories.</i>

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,832
<i>The first time I ever...</i>

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,997
<i>♪ Old times

92
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,198
<i>♪ Look away!

93
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,078
I got your damn email.

94
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,958
<i>♪ I wish I was in Dixie</i>

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,116
How long has that
light been like that?

106
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,360
I don't know. A month, maybe.

107
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,161
And nobody's come to fix it?

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,680
Nobody don't fix
nothing around here.

109
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,955
Well have you asked?

110
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,309
I'm watching.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,838
Leave it alone.
I'm used to it now.

112
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,075
Oh...

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,156
Better, huh?

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,230
Now it's too dark.

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,913
What'd you do that for?
Listen, Ma.

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,229
I'm running for governor.

117
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,879
I'm gonna announce
in a few days.

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,633
That's why I came up to Philly.

119
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,949
There's a community
meeting tomorrow.

120
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,190
I'm gonna talk to
the shipbuilders

121
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,555
about a plan to
bring their jobs back,

122
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,279
so they support me
in the election.

123
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,398
I don't know nothing about that stuff.
It's over my head.

124
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,757
Okay, listen, there's
gonna be some stories

125
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,433
coming out about me,
in the news,

126
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,034
about my past.

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,350
I just wanted to
give you a heads up,

128
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,630
so it doesn't
catch you off guard.

129
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,916
I don't watch the news no more.
Bunch of garbage.

130
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,959
You want to see some
pictures of Kevin and Sarah?

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,560
Too dark to look at pictures.

132
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
No, no, it's on my phone,
you don't need any light.

133
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,115
Get it away from me.
I hate those things.

134
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,759
Brain cancer.

135
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,672
It wasn't just up the stairs, it
was up three flights of stairs,

136
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,752
in the science building.

137
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,154
And Gluckenheimer,
what he did...

138
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,632
"Well, you look lovely
today, Mrs. Governor."

139
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,757
And the thing took a dump.

140
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,680
Right. And they
couldn't get it back...

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,920
You can get a cow up three flights of
stairs, but you can't get it down!

142
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,880
And that's why in the end he said,
"Who wants steak for dinner?"

143
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,036
How are you boys doing?

144
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,110
We're good.

145
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,429
- You think I'm fat?
- Take the Fifth.

146
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,950
Seriously, Phil here thinks
I got fat with old age.

147
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,718
You're a big man with
an even bigger heart.

148
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,075
There you go!

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
She says you're chubby.

150
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,678
I think I'm going to go back to the hotel.
Okay? Have fun.

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,796
I love this woman.

152
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,994
Don't let him get
into too much trouble.

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,955
They'll have grounds for impeachment
when we're done with him.

154
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,440
We better get another drink
before they close up.

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,795
You're comin' with
me to help carry them.

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,241
You're gonna be
the waiter tonight.

157
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,631
Lazy-ass cadet. Lazy-ass cadet.

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,836
Hold on a second there,
partner.

159
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,880
You had no idea we were coming?

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,229
Complete surprise.

161
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,356
I thought Higgins might've...

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,521
No, he played it perfectly.

163
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,596
Made me think you
weren't coming at all.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,710
Are you kidding?

165
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,401
We wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

166
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,196
On the library, are they
gonna put Frank or Francis?

167
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,350
Francis.

168
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,996
It's the same as the name above the
door in my office in the Capitol.

169
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,753
Francis is
better for libraries.

170
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,599
Frank is better
for bumper stickers.

171
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,433
I got a few of those.

172
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,240
Does anybody ever actually
call you Francis?

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,834
Claire does.
She's the only one.

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,680
She seems like a real prize.

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,070
She is.

176
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,957
Bar was already shut down,
but look what I scored.

177
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
Hey, Caroline.

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,830
What do you want?

179
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,036
Is Paul around?

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,111
Paul, did you invite him here?

181
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,160
Did you ask him here after
we said all those times

182
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,793
that we're not gonna
let him bother you?

183
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,996
He screwed you over
one too many times.

184
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,190
Who you talking about?

185
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,999
I'm talking about Peter
Russo at the front door.

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,595
Did you ask him here, or did
he just come on his own?

187
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,194
Does he know as soon as
we're finished with him...

188
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,316
Stop.

189
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,754
No, I'm not gonna
stop until you

190
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,481
actually deal with it
and get rid of him.

191
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,478
Paul, you got a minute to talk?

192
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,074
There's nothing to talk about.

193
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,473
I want to apologize for when I
saw you last time in Washington,

194
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,596
how I treated you.

195
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,796
Is that it?

196
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,916
And I want to talk
about the shipyard.

197
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,517
I got a plan to fix it.

198
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,516
You don't want everything
going into the Roth IRA.

199
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,954
Five, ten grand a year,

200
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,475
and I'll set you up with a
nice diversified package,

201
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,677
low risk, high yield.

202
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,269
I think Claire and I have things
pretty well under control.

203
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,278
If I brought a senior U.S.
Congressman into the fund,

204
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,031
that would really up my
stock in the company.

205
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,839
What're you all gabbing
about back there?

206
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,713
We were talkin'
about the old library.

207
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,960
Yeah, what's happening to it?

208
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,520
They gonna tear it down?
I don't know.

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,957
They could gut it, they could
turn it into a student center.

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,037
Hey, we should sneak in there.

211
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,873
Like we used to.

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
Do it. I'm game.

213
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
What the hell, why not?

214
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,479
There you go, that's it.

215
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,594
It's a library!

216
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,520
The Association
had about $3 million

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,194
saved up in reserve
for emergencies.

218
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,796
But you split that up between
12,000 members, it's nothing.

219
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,917
Couple weeks' groceries.

220
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,554
There's a bill I'm working on.

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,956
Major federal funds
going towards

222
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,080
public parks, green commercial
spaces, cleaning up waste sites.

223
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,357
That's construction jobs,
park management, retail...

224
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,715
How many?

225
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,718
Five thousand jobs.
That's not even half...

226
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,870
It's a start. How soon?

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
A year, maybe two...

228
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,954
Two fucking years?

229
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,952
What're we
supposed to do until then?

230
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,599
Listen, there's a community
meeting tomorrow...

231
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,716
I heard.

232
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,916
I'm gonna go over
everything in detail.

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
You gonna be there? I
wasn't planning on it.

234
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,874
I'd like you to be there.

235
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,996
Everybody respects you.

236
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,280
You want me to vouch for you?

237
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,239
Listen,
I'm gonna tell you something

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,993
that only a handful
of people know.

239
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,909
I'm running for governor.

240
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,473
I announce soon.

241
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,791
But I need the Association
behind me before I do that.

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,639
Now I know I let you
down with the shipyard,

243
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,234
but if I win
the governor's race

244
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,880
I can get
everything back on track.

245
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,360
You show up on my doorstep
asking for my forgiveness,

246
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,635
and now you want me
to be your lapdog?

247
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,677
After I lost my fucking job?

248
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,234
Okay, this Watershed Bill
is just the beginning.

249
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,391
If I'm governor,
there's so much I can do.

250
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,194
Yeah, it's bullshit. You
just want to use me.

251
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,760
It's not like that.

252
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,149
Yeah, it's exactly like that.

253
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,756
Jesus Christ.
You fucking politicians.

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,069
Paul...

255
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,430
Claire.

256
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,875
I didn't realize you and
Frank were staying here.

257
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,275
We always stay here when
we're in Charleston.

258
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,114
You know that, Remy.
The '08 campaign...

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,714
I promise it was a coincidence.
My assistant booked it.

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,234
Is Frank around?

261
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,630
He's not. He's off cavorting
with his old classmates.

262
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,310
Hmm.

263
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,472
You want to sit down
and have a drink?

264
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,197
They booked me the bridal suite.
There's champagne on ice...

265
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,474
My, my, you've grown very confident
since you worked for Francis.

266
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,233
I've always been confident,
Claire.

267
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,391
You never would've
invited me upstairs.

268
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,675
Never had the bridal suite.

269
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
The staff always stayed in the
Best Western four blocks away.

270
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,438
Enjoy your champagne.

271
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,796
I wasn't suggesting
anything more than a drink.

272
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,110
Weren't you?

273
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,516
Purely being polite.

274
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,469
Good night, Remy.

275
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,400
The bridal suite's on the top
floor, at the end of the hallway,

276
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,470
if you change your mind.

277
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,910
Good night, Claire.

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,917

got a lot smaller.

Surprise.

I went through puberty.

I can totally
see you here at 16.

300
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,834
Ooh!

301
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,357
Got in some trouble
on this bed, huh?

302
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,994
Woke up the whole block.

303
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,561
Hey, how'd it go with Paul?

304
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,119
He told me to fuck off.

305
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,709
Which is what my mother told
me, in her own special way.

306
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,436
Am I gonna meet her?

307
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,476
You don't want to meet her.

308
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,598
I just want to stop by,
say hey, see her face.

309
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,598
Christina, it was really sweet
of you to come up here.

310
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,910
Seriously.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
I'm officially
convinced that you're

312
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,154
the most amazing woman
I've ever been with.

313
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,596
But I meant it when I said I
wanted to take this trip alone.

314
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,360
This thing tomorrow isn't
gonna be pleasant.

315
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,474
Which is why I came. To be here for you.
Moral support.

316
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,069
I know these people, they're
going to lay into me big time.

317
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,637
Tomorrow's an important
day for the campaign.

318
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,600
Don't fight me on this.

319
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,550
Okay.

320
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,315
So do I get a hotel?

321
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,959
Do I stay here?

322
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,351
Come on, don't be like that.

323
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,398
A hotel would be
more comfortable.

324
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,351
But it would be a waste of
valuable campaign funds.

325
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,792
Oh, campaign funds.

326
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,517
You see that crack
up in the ceiling?

327
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,590
Mmm-hmm.

328
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,191
I used to fall asleep
staring at it every night.

329
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,597
I know every inch and curve.

330
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,436
It's dark in here.
I'm scared of the dark!

331
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,079
Get out of the way!

332
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,560
Hey, hey!

333
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,160
Big fucking gamble, my man.

334
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,679
Let there be light!

335
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,752
What are you thinking about?

336
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,710
How come you and Frank
have never had kids?

337
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,355
You've never had kids.

338
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,630
<i>Yeah, but I'm not married.</i>

339
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,353
Answer the question.

340
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,552
We just decided not to.

341
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,353
There wasn't some
big conversation.

342
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,280
I think you're lying.

343
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,160
<i>Think whatever you want.</i>

344
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,119
You honestly never
thought about it?

345
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,029
I mean, yeah,
maybe once or twice.

346
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,672
I mean, I don't feel
there's some void.

347
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,680
<i>I'm perfectly happy without.</i>

348
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,550
What about you?

349
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,116
Can you imagine me wiping a
baby's ass and changing nappies?

350
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,954
No, I can't.

351
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,794
Actually, yes, I just did, I'm going
to have to get off the phone.

352
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,712
<i>You've ruined everything.</i>

353
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,515
We really should get off. It's
been over an hour I think.

354
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,630
Okay.

355
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,996
Go on then.

356
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,912
I'm hanging up right now.
No, I am.

357
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,755
Yeah! Let's go, Ken, let's go.

358
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,109
Go, go, go.

359
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,911
Yeah, come on. Giddy up, come on.
Don't quit on me.

360
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,633
I lost count.

361
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,433
Come on,
don't quit on me.
Don't quit.

362
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,231
No. Oh, God.

363
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,995
You win.

364
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,111
But it's not a fair fight.

365
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,592
You run a rafting company. I
sit behind a desk all day.

366
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,672
I'd love to see
your ass with a paddle

367
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,757
bouncing through
a class-four rapid.

368
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,193
If I can whip
Congress into submission,

369
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,039
I'm not afraid of
a little white water.

370
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,117
You can't tame a rapid, Frank.

371
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,356
My heart is beating so fast. If I
have a heart attack it's your fault.

372
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,800
Mine too.

373
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,550
Here.

374
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,154
I need another drink.

375
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,590
I think I'll have another, too.

376
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,994
Don't bogart that.

377
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,837
Do you think
this place made us?

378
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,276
How do you mean?

379
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,914
When I walked on campus today I
wondered, did it mean anything?

380
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,512
If it's just a place
we spent four years

381
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,632
of our lives or was there more?

382
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,750
I don't know.

383
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,030
I do know you
were always the guy

384
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,000
who was going to get a
building named after him.

385
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,112
I knew that the moment I saw you
cuss out the drill sergeant

386
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,600
when we were knobs.

387
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,719
The library is a sham.

388
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,232
Higgins asked me a favor, I
asked someone else a favor,

389
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,119
they slapped my name on it.

390
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,953
Politics. Like everything else.

391
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,509
Not everybody gets
asked those favors.

392
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,159
Or knows how to
deliver on them.

393
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,550
In 50 years, they'll just
replace it with something else,

394
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,518
just like they're doing
with this for mine.

395
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,435
You still built something.
However long it lasts.

396
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,637
The library doesn't matter.

397
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,712
But I want to think
that this place did.

398
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,551
I think it meant
a lot to us, then.

399
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,080
And what about us?

400
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,393
Honestly, I haven't really
thought about it that much.

401
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,949
It's a long time ago.

402
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,599
We were so close.

403
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,430
Like brothers.

404
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,920
More than brothers.

405
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,440
We were kids, Frank.

406
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,953
We messed around
a couple of times.

407
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,117
I was so drawn to you...

408
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,758
I could always make you laugh.

409
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,360
How did we lose touch?

410
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,478
You went to law school.
I joined the army.

411
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,117
You ran for Congress.
I moved to Colorado.

412
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,520
Thirty years goes by.

413
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,593
I got children older
than we were back then.

414
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,354
Do you have anyone, Frank?

415
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,035
I have Claire.

416
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,960
Besides Claire.

417
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,836
I have, from time to time.

418
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,597
If I want someone, I want them.

419
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,270
It's attraction.

420
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,429
It made me happy to
make you happy, Frank.

421
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,791
Didn't see any harm in it.

422
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,315
You know why I love rafting?

423
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,230
When you're on the water,

424
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,472
all you're thinking about is
what's right in front of you.

425
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,112
Everything is in the moment.

426
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,396
I don't really have time
to think about the past.

427
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,717
You meant something to me.

428
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,280
I believe that.

429
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,960
All gone.

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,395
I don't feel so well...

431
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,749
You gonna be sick?

432
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,072
No. No, I just...

433
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,069
Take a break.

434
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,958
Can we just stay here for a little bit?
Until I feel better.

435
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,718
Take as long as you like.

436
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,598
I got nowhere to go.

437
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,873
A few more weeks
and we'll be through.

438
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,519
A few more weeks
and we'll be through.

439
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,353
And I won't
have to look at you.

440
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,233
And I won't
have to look at you.

441
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,520
Ugly, ugly, ugly you.

442
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,559
It's almost 7:00.

443
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,276
I don't even remember
going to sleep...

444
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,195
Come on.

445
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,877
1,100 acres of development.
Yes.

446
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,990
30% public parks.

447
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,036
Yep.

448
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,190
45% shopping and office space.

449
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,350
Yes.

450
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,159
25% middle-income housing.

451
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,550
You going?

452
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,750
Is it required?

453
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,950
I don't think so.

454
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,157
Who is he that they're
naming the place after?

455
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,550
Some guy who went here.
I think he's dead.

456
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,235
We had to set up the chairs yesterday.
It was hot as shit.

457
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,754
That sucks.

458
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,269
I'm gonna try to get some
shut-eye before the ceremony.

459
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,589
I'll see you all later?

460
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,637
Later it is.
Hey, Frank,
before I forget,

461
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,679
here's my card, so your
money manager can call me.

462
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,950
Get some rest.

463
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,714
Claire.

464
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,834
You look like you're hurting.

465
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,394
It was an all-nighter.

466
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,960
Was it fun at least?

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,641
It was fun.
I need to get some shut-eye.

468
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,435
Remy's staying here.

469
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,433
He harassing you
about the donation?

470
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,115
Oh, nothing I can't handle.
Go get some rest.

471
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,350
Were you good?

472
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,510
Not bad.

473
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,275
I wasn't a starter, but I
got my time on the court.

474
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,354
I think you look sexier
now, all grown up.

475
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,755
Congressman?

476
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,950
We're ready for you.

477
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,675
<i>You said two years.</i>

478
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,156
<i>Yeah, I think two years
is a realistic estimate.</i>

479
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,230
<i>If it passes at all.</i>

480
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,356
<i>Which I think it will.</i>

481
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,556
<i>You think or you know?</i>

482
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,511
<i>I can't predict 100%, but
I'm confident it will.</i>

483
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,235
<i>You think, you're confident,
you can't predict 100%,</i>

484
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,515
<i>how does any of that help us?</i>

485
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,750
<i>I'll tell you something,</i>

486
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,799
<i>I'm 100% unable to pay
my mortgage right now.</i>

487
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,237
<i>I'm 100% unable to buy
my kids school supplies.</i>

488
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,676
<i>We supposed to live off
my husband's disability?</i>

489
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,114
<i>There'll be paid training
programs available.</i>

490
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,760
<i>How much will they pay?</i>

491
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,997
<i>Granted, it's less than
you made at the shipyard.</i>

492
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,236
<i>So how much?</i>

493
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,476
<i>It's about $6 an hour.</i>

494
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,112
<i>That's not even minimum wage.</i>

495
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,270
Horseshit, Russo!

496
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,350
<i>You have to see it
as an investment.</i>

497
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,035
<i>The training programs are
a valuable resource...</i>

498
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,270
<i>You're not getting it.</i>

499
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,591
<i>I can't afford to
make investments.</i>

500
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,031
<i>$6 an hour puts my
family on the street.</i>

501
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,635
What, do you want
me to work five jobs?

502
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,838
<i>If you get a part-time job, that
and the training program...</i>

503
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,195
<i>You want to know what I think?</i>

504
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,590
<i>I think you sit
around in Washington</i>

505
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,030
<i>coming up with all
sorts of fancy numbers</i>

506
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,117
<i>and solutions that
look good on paper,</i>

507
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,317
<i>but that doesn't cut
it for the rest of us.</i>

508
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,234
You said you had our backs,
you lying piece of shit!

509
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,832
<i>We don't eat paper for dinner. You
can't put a paper roof over your head.</i>

510
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,312
<i>When we all voted for you,</i>

511
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,312
<i>I didn't think that every
one of those votes</i>

512
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,392
<i>was another nail in
our own coffins.</i>

513
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,275
Please, everybody, just
sit down for 10 minutes,

514
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,960
<i>we can go over this
proposal point-by-point.</i>

515
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,157
<i>And you can get the
information you need</i>

516
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,437
<i>to get the resources
that you want...</i>

517
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,314
It's like they don't
want to find a solution.

518
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,920
They're scared.

519
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,480
I understand
that they're scared,

520
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,994
but that doesn't mean
they can't listen...

521
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,600
You don't know
these people, Christina.

522
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,753
I worked in your office
for three years.

523
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,753
I spoke to them, I took their
calls, I replied to their emails...

524
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,320
You didn't grow up with them.

525
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,550
I don't need to
grow up hand-to-mouth

526
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,875
to empathize with
the fact that...

527
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,952
They're not interested
in empathy.

528
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,917
The house keys
are in my jacket.

529
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,520
I'll call you.

530
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,000
Peter.

531
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,440
I said I'll call you.

532
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,039
Do your homework or
Sister Mary Joseph...

533
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,518
You didn't do it...
Don't lie to me.

534
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,632
I used to use the same
ploy with my parents.

535
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,639
Baloney.

536
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,193
We do the homework,
and then we eat.

537
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,555
Who's hungry?

538
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,593
- What do you guys want?
- Hamburger.

539
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,074
- Pizza.
- No.

540
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,629
No pizza, you guys
can eat that every...

541
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,751
Sweetheart,
take the kids upstairs.

542
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,075
How'd you get in here?

543
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,958
You still keep the spare key behind
the loose brick on the porch.

544
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,591
You break into my house? You
scare my kids like that?

545
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,433
We gotta talk, Paul.
We talked last night.

546
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,556
Now get out.

547
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,512
I can convince these people,
but I need your help.

548
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,279
Leave my house. Sit down.

549
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,750
I don't want to
have to hurt you

550
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,876
with my children upstairs,
Petey.

551
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,950
Then help me.

552
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,116
This is your last chance.

553
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,190
I'm not going anywhere.

554
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,474
Get back upstairs!

555
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,474
What are we doing?

556
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,794
I don't want to
fight you, Petey.

557
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,791
I don't want to
fight you either.

558
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,996
I will, but we don't have to.

559
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,074
What do you want me to do?

560
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,194
<i>You elected me
to represent you.</i>

561
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,881
<i>But I couldn't forestall
the inevitable.</i>

562
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,270
The shipyard was closing.

563
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,913
If not this year, then next, or the year after.
We all know that.

564
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,309
I could have lied to you. I could
have pretended to do more.

565
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,120
But I don't believe
in living in the past.

566
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,317
I only care about the future.

567
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,999
Here's another truth that's
gonna be hard to swallow...

568
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,958
I'm all you've got.

569
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,033
Nobody in Washington gives
a fuck about you. No one.

570
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
He's right.

571
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,236
Whatever you think of Petey, we
either go with him or we got nothing.

572
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,474
Now does what I'm
offering you come

573
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,120
anywhere near what
you want or deserve?

574
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,150
No.

575
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,039
But you gotta open your eyes and
take what's in front of you.

576
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,236
We can build on that.

577
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,070
5,000 jobs becomes 10, then 15.

578
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,200
Not in the snap of a finger, but
faster than doing nothing will.

579
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,512
Can I count on all of you?

580
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,351
All right,
I'll take that as a yes.

581
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,520
We'll need your
contact information,

582
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,761
so we can send you materials
to share with your friends.

583
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,560
Now, let's talk about the way the
money's gonna get phased in.

584
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,478
It's gonna happen in six stages.
Stage one...

585
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,551
<i>♪ Oh, say,
does that star-spangled</i>

586
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,475

<i>♪ And the home of the brave?</i>

589
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,152

<i>But I don't blame you.</i>

<i>When I was your age, why,</i>

616

<i>Harmony.</i>

621

<i>It's not about what's

and march 20 miles,</i>

630
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,396
<i>but these days I'm lucky I
got up these three steps.</i>

631
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,994
<i>I want to thank you very much.</i>

632
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
<i>This is a great honor.</i>

633
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,956
<i>I want to thank
President Higgins,</i>

634
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,272
<i>and of course, the love
of my life, Claire.</i>

635
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,115
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

636
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,673
Are you okay? Yes.

637
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,753
Hey, Ma.

638
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,557
This is Christina. I told
you about her yesterday.

639
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,233
Hi, Mrs. Russo. Hey.

640
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,554
We just came by to say goodbye.

641
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,160
We have to catch
a train in about an hour.

642
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,356
Okay.

643
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,480
They still haven't fixed that light?
Uh-uh.

644
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,070
Things went well today.

645
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,197
I think the folks in the yard
are going to get behind me.

646
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,430
Peter did a great job.

647
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,193
Hand me that blanket.

648
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,872
AC in here is nuts.

649
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,714
What happened to your hand?

650
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,877
I got in a fight. Did you win?

651
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,629
Yeah. I guess I did.

652
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,550
That's my Peter.

653
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,552
So you're fucking my son?

654
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,680
Lighten up.
I'm just messing with ya.

655
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,790
Excuse me?

656
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,910
Hold on a second.

657
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,992
Yeah?
Yeah, my mother's in room 409.

658
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,639
She has a light out that
needs to be replaced.

659
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,638
All right. I'll take care of it.
Okay, thanks.

660
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,639
Look, baby, you put that pink thing
on, I'm telling you. It's just...

661
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,440
What you want me to wear? You
want me to wear that little...

662
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,759
Hold on. What is it?

663
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,754
The light in my mother's room.

664
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,160
Right. I told you I'll
take care of it later.

665
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,879
No. You'll take care of it now.

666
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,036
I gotta go.

667
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,475
And turn the AC down while
you're in there, too.

668
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,876
Yes, sir.

669
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,790
Thank you very much.

670
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,950
You're very welcome, sir.

671
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,156
Take care of yourselves.

672
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,432
Real proud of you, Frank.

673
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,961
I hate to admit it,
but I feel the same.

674
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,950
Well, having all you here
is what made it special.

675
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,958
Now, you stay in touch.
Will do.

676
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,959
See you, buddy.

677
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,914
Beautiful ceremony, Frank.

678
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,799
Yeah, they did a good job.

679
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,109
Your speech.

680
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,120
I'm glad I was here for that.

681
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,356
Me too.

682
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,880
You should come out
to Salida sometime.

683
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,561
I'll take you out on
the Arkansas River.

684
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,636
I should do that.

685
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,790
Anytime you want.

686
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,470
Yep.

687
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,315
All right.

688
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,000
Francis...

689
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,594
Edward has the car ready.

690
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,035
I'll be right there.

691
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,999
Take your time.

692
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,792
You hear from Peter?

693
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,752
Looks like
the shipbuilders
are on board.

694
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,194
Tomorrow morning
we start working

695
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,754
on his draft for his
announcement speech.

696
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,876
Got it.

697
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,320
And I want the brief on the
mark-up for the Watershed Bill...

698
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,914
I got that with me.

699
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,913
Ride with me to the airport, we
can go through it in the car.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
