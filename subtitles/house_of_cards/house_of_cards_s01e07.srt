1
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,597
Vice President Matthews.

2
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,753
Mr. Vice President.

3
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,916
Mr. Vice President.

4
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,196
Frank.

5
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,310
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stand on your mark.

6
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm fine right here.

7
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,674
Two minutes, people.

8
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,510
So they pull me from the car, both
legs broken, fractured skull,

9
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,875
punctured lung.

10
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,076
My heart stops.

11
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,796
Two full minutes.

12
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,233
They're pumping my chest.
Nothing.

13
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,754
They grab the defibrillators.

14
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,110
Nothing.

15
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,196
Third time,
the pistons start firin'.

16
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,237
Doctors tell me
it's a miracle I'm alive.

17
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,789
But seriously, you talk about
a wake-up call from God.

18
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,910
You don't get to come
back from the dead twice.

19
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,593
The President of
the United States.

20
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,676
Good morning.

21
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,712
The Education Reform and Achievement
Act that I sign into law today

22
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,912
will affect every child and
parent in the United States,

23
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,598
will ensure a better educated
workforce for decades to come,

24
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,550
and will reinforce America's pre-eminence
as an intellectual superpower.

25
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,000
And I'd like to thank
one man in particular,

26
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,910
who never lost sight
of the larger mission,

27
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,959
who spearheaded this
bill from the beginning.

28
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,918
And that's
Congressman Frank Underwood.

29
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,275
Invited guests, please join us in
the East Room for refreshments.

30
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,192
Media,
we will convene immediately

31
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,198
in the Briefing Room
for our conference.

32
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,559
Linda, thank you so
much for all the help

33
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,353
you gave us in
getting this bill passed.

34
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,433
No, thank you, Frank. This was
your baby from the beginning.

35
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,240
I appreciate you standing your
ground on this one, Frank.

36
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,039
I'm smart enough to
admit when I was wrong.

37
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,913
I was just telling Frank
we should set up a weekly,

38
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,360
so he can keep us up-to-date on
what's going on in the House.

39
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
That sounds like a great idea.

40
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,470
Congratulations, sir.

41
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,790
Garrett...

42
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,994
I was wondering if we could
talk for a few minutes.

43
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,197
That thing I mentioned
a couple of weeks ago,

44
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,475
about the jobs tax credit...

45
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,598
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
Jim, and I think it's a good idea,

46
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,315
but I'd like to look over my
notes first, if you don't mind,

47
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,999
so I can talk about it
intelligently with you.

48
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,999
Sir, you have your call
with the Prime Minister.

49
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,030
Busy man.

50
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,310
Yes, he is.

51
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,074
Frank, I hear that
you are heading up

52
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,920
the special election
in my home state.

53
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,036
Peter Russo.

54
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,920
We're trying to keep that under the
radar until he officially announces.

55
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,200
In fact, we're not even working

56
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,390
out of my office
until that happens.

57
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
Where are you working from?

58
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,354
The basement of my house.

59
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,269
Any reason why the DNC didn't
ask my advice on the candidate?

60
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,431
Well, I thought they passed
it by you, or that Linda did.

61
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,000
Nobody did.

62
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,554
Well, that is unacceptable.

63
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,233
And I have major doubts
about Russo.

64
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,999
His inexperience?

65
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,279
Yes. And he's urban-based. I don't know
if he'll connect with rural voters.

66
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,113
Look, frankly that's one
of my concerns as well.

67
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,714
We're working on that.

68
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,235
But if you were to come
out and stump with him,

69
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,789
that would go
a long way to convince...

70
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,076
Frank, I can't stump for
somebody I don't believe in.

71
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,874
It's early days yet. I'd ask
you to keep an open mind.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,959
And let me know if you want me to set
up a meeting between the two of you.

73
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,159
Because, sir, an endorsement from
you would be a big coup for him.

74
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,876
It's good to see you,
Mr. Vice President.

75
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,070
Frank.

76
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,518
Congressman Underwood.

77
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,073
Ms. Barnes.
I was under the impression

78
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,879
you didn't want to
cover the White House.

79
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,189
<i>Slugline just got
access yesterday.</i>

80
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,595
I know.

81
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,672
<i>I left The Herald because I didn't
want to cover the White House,</i>

82
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,876
and now here I am.

83
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,316
Access isn't the same
as a ball and chain.

84
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
Am I only gonna see you
at bill signings now?

85
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,672
I haven't heard from you
in three weeks.

86
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,319
Insecurity bores me.

87
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,073
I feel the same way
about condescension.

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
Your place. This evening. And I'll
text when I'm about to arrive.

89
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,679
What if I'm busy?

90
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,718
You're just afraid I'm
gonna stand you up again.

91
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,951
I just want to make sure
it's worth my while.

92
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,954
It'll be worth your while.
This'll make up for last time.

93
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,795
It's a piece of history. From
the President's hand to yours.

94
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,111
You believe in all that higher power
stuff they talk about in the room?

95
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,555
I believe there are things
beyond our control.

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,199
Who or what's controlling
them, that I don't know.

97
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,274
I don't believe in God. Heaven.
Hell. None of it.

98
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
Too much Catholic school?

99
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,394
Maybe.

100
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,836
I'm not saying you have
to believe in God, Peter,

101
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,513
or anything for that matter.

102
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
But you shouldn't
rule anything out.

103
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,630
I should go.

104
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,040
It's on the campaign.

105
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,391
Our cross tabs show
81% of likely voters

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,361
are willing to consider
a recovering alcoholic.

107
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,960
Now, those numbers dip a little

108
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,918
when you introduce
cocaine, but not by much.

109
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,270
Randy?

110
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
It's a risk,
but it'll make waves.

111
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,200
Free coverage across the board.

112
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,761
The narrative has
to be redemption,

113
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,393
a phoenix from the ashes.

114
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,920
Well, let's not
focus on the ashes.

115
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,469
We don't want people to
think Peter was a disaster.

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,631
No, no.
We focus on the positive.

117
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,758
A "fresh start" and a "clean start"
both did well in focus groups.

118
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,150
"Clean start" sounds too
much like "clean slate."

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,230
I like "fresh start."

120
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,316
Yeah, I do too.

121
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,754
How we doing on
the fundraising?

122
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,877
The alcoholic thing will turn off
some of the in-state donors,

123
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,996
but it's an off-year election.

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,470
We can hit up the usual suspects
in New York and California.

125
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,995
Walter, how vulnerable are we?

126
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,719
I'm not prepared to
answer that question.

127
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,073
Peter and I have yet to perform

128
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,759
the holy sacrament
of confession.

129
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,478
We still need to address
the shipyard closing, too.

130
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,994
Claire's helping us with that.

131
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,835
We are pushing a bill called the
Delaware River Watershed Act

132
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,673
and I think it's going to bring

133
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,553
about 5,000 jobs
into Peter's districts

134
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,756
over the next three years.

135
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,876
We have a draft
of the bill completed.

136
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,078
Peter's in the process
of securing co-sponsors.

137
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,277
And who have you called,
by the way?

138
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,560
I have some emails out, but most
of them wanna see a bill first.

139
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,478
Have you set up a meeting
with the shipbuilders yet?

140
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,550
I don't think
they're gonna back me.

141
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,030
That's the entire point
of the bill, Peter.

142
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,873
Well,
if I go to them and I say,

143
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,634
"Hey, some of you maybe
will get your jobs back,

144
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,195
"not tomorrow,
but three years from now,

145
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,317
"and most of you won't be getting
your jobs back anyway..."

146
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,631
All right, let's put a pin in
this until we get more sponsors.

147
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,712
I have to go to the office.
I'll catch you all later.

148
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,871
Okay, let's move on
to our field plan.

149
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,474
I want to go through the
regions one by one...

150
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,789
Francis.

151
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,590
We spent six weeks
on that bill.

152
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,512
It'll be fine.
He'll come around.

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,233
I'll see you later tonight?

154
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,640
I have an appointment.

155
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,074
So I won't see you
until morning.

156
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,516
I'll be back before you get up.

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,560
I appreciate your taking
the time today, sir.

158
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,074
Did you get that
tax credit memo

159
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,554
the economic
research team
put together?

160
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,030
You didn't ask me here
to talk about memos.

161
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,794
I know small talk
when I hear it, Linda.

162
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,317
The President has asked that you
take a step back from Pennsylvania.

163
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,676
You've been taking a lot of trips
there, meeting with legislators...

164
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,752
It's my home state.
There's a jobs crisis.

165
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,194
We can't afford
to play favorites.

166
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,920
The message is 50 states,
one solution.

167
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,957
Not one state, 50 solutions.

168
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,431
I never expected to be involved
in every policy or decision,

169
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,592
but I have been completely
cut out of everything.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,832
We value your input, Mr. Vice
President, but right now, we can't...

171
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,990
Don't condescend, Linda.

172
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,351
No one even asked me who I
thought should fill my seat.

173
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,399
Why is Frank Underwood leading
the charge on that, not me?

174
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,874
That is a DNC issue.

175
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,912
We are staying out of
it and so should you.

176
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,515
And so I'm supposed to just cut
ribbons and go to funerals?

177
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,874
You know
what you signed up for.

178
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

179
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,953
I didn't get my pen.

180
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,716
Your pen?

181
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,876
From the bill signing.

182
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,192
We'll see what we
can do about that.

183
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,440
I can see your security guy.

184
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,914
Meechum?

185
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,634
He's cute.

186
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,633
He'd never go for you.

187
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,995
Why not?

188
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,878
You're too intimidating.

189
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,031
He's the one with the gun.

190
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,920
But you're the one
with the Congressman.

191
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,910
Uh-uh.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,832
We'll talk after.

193
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,593
We'll talk before.

194
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,754
Peter Russo.

195
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,512
Pennsylvania's first district.
He's gonna run for Governor,

196
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,071
fill Matthews' seat. It's
an exclusive profile.

197
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,550
With someone
no one's ever heard of.

198
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,710
What's the angle?

199
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,393
Alcohol, drugs.

200
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,199
He's a kid from the streets.

201
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,272
I want the profile to come
out as soon as he announces,

202
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,556
and I'd like it to be kind.

203
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,472
I don't write puff pieces.

204
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,950
Then get someone
else to write it.

205
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,633
I thought you had
something for me.

206
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,155
It's too easy for people
to link me as your source.

207
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,959
It's dangerous.

208
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,790
I don't benefit from handing
out headlines to other people.

209
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,631
Generosity is its
own form of power, Zoe.

210
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,755
<i>Step six.</i>

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,073
<i>Take the opposite edge
and fold it into a...</i>

212
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,800
<i>Step seven.</i>

213
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,112
<i>Turn the model over
and fold both edges</i>

214
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,953
<i>to the center of the model.</i>

215
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,993
You always wear
sunglasses at night?

216
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,469
How did you find me?

217
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,794
I figured you had
to be in government.

218
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,320
I kept googling till
I found your picture.

219
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,357
This won't work,
what you're doing.

220
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,879
That was a one-time deal. You don't
get to keep coming back for more.

221
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,314
I'll go to the police.

222
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,995
They'll laugh in your face.
Look at you.

223
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,752
If the police won't listen to
me, I'll call TV stations.

224
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,473
I know the names...

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,157
Douglas Stamper, Peter
Russo, Frank Underwood.

226
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,194
You are walking down a road
you do not want to walk down.

227
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,196
Please, I won't call anyone.

228
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,714
But I need your help.

229
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,951
I don't have anywhere to go. I
don't have anyone I can call.

230
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,557
I've had to do things. And I
don't want to do it anymore.

231
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,791
That's all I've got right now.

232
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,600
Find a place to stay and
let me know where you are.

233
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,757
I'll figure something out.

234
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,510
You hungry?

235
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,593
What's your name?

236
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,910
Sapphire.

237
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,635
No. What's your name?

238
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,080
Rachel.

239
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,438
Your ex-wife. Anything uncouth?

240
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,510
How do you mean?

241
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Bondage, orgies, water sports?

242
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,110
No. Definitely not.

243
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,032
Narcotics?
She wasn't into that.

244
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,873
Not even a little ganga?

245
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,519
Okay, once in a blue moon.

246
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,590
Ever with your children?

247
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,790
God, no!

248
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,870
Ever in front of them?

249
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,475
Look, I'm not the world's best
dad, but I would never do that.

250
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,358
Fine. Let's move
on to prostitution.

251
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,760
How long is this gonna take?

252
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,600
Until there's nothing I
don't know about you.

253
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,710
I wrote all this down.

254
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,599
I've been doing this a
long time, Congressman.

255
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,956
I know when I've scraped
all the shit off the shoe.

256
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,474
Prostitution.

257
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,079
After my divorce, I took a trip to Thailand.
It was about two weeks.

258
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,150
How many women?

259
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
Ten. Fifteen.

260
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,040
I... I don't know.
It was a bit of a blur.

261
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,913
There were drugs?

262
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,990
Yes.

263
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,757
Opium, speed, some smack.

264
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,433
Powder or needles? Both.

265
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,749
Would any of these women
know who you are?

266
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,354
No. None of them spoke English.

267
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,039
And I never mentioned
I was a congressman.

268
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,760
Have you mainlined heroin
back here in the States?

269
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,953
Just once.
Any scars on your arm?

270
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,714
No. I was mainly into cocaine.

271
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,392
What about prostitutes here in D.C.?
How often?

272
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,641
I fucked around a bit, okay?

273
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,910
Details, please.

274
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,713
Do you get off on this
or something?

275
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,641
Does a doctor enjoy it
when he cups your balls

276
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,399
and asks you to cough?

277
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,476
You wanna know how
many times I came?

278
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,950
I honestly don't care
whether you win.

279
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,077
But if you do, work with me.

280
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,959
How often did you solicit
prostitutes in D.C.?

281
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,077
Once every two or three months.

282
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,232
Sometimes more frequently,
sometimes less.

283
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,039
Do you have reason to believe
any of them were underage?

284
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,952
Jesus! No. Look, they
were mostly high-end.

285
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,280
That doesn't mean they were 18.

286
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,720
I need a fucking break!

287
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,633
What's going on?

288
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,473
He's an amateur, Frank.

289
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,392
If I can get under his
skin in less than an hour,

290
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,039
how do you think he'll
hold up under the press?

291
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,230
It'll be a turkey shoot.

292
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,152
All right. I'll speak to him.

293
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
Frank, it's just, it's not gonna work.
I'm gonna get crucified.

294
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,275
You'll be fine. We've got
a crack team behind you.

295
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,080
It doesn't matter how good the team is.
With my past? Come on.

296
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,311
From the very beginning, I
said this was the plan.

297
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,232
You agreed to it. I
didn't think it through.

298
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,837
We have to tackle this head-on,
or the GOP will crucify you.

299
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,276
We have to steal their
ammunition from them.

300
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,552
Honesty is your best
defense and offense.

301
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,994
I'm the one that
has to get in front of

302
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
these cameras
and say this shit.

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,193
They don't have to say it.
I do.

304
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,033
Peter...
I wanna be governor. I do.

305
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,799
But not this way.
I just can't do it.

306
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,960
If you weren't unsure now, there'd
be something wrong with you.

307
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,394
I expected this.

308
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,790
Not easy,
what we're asking you to do.

309
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,276
It's okay to
vacillate a little.

310
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,519
I'm not trying to throw
a wrench in the works.

311
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,353
I know you're not.
I'll tell you what.

312
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,511
You take the rest of the day off.
You go back to your office,

313
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,632
you catch up with whatever
you have to catch up on,

314
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,753
you get a good night's sleep,
you go to a meeting tomorrow,

315
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,752
and then you come here and we'll
talk the whole thing through.

316
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,320
Can you give me at least that?

317
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,790
Yeah. Okay, Frank.

318
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,156
Good.

319
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,118
What's going on with all
the little sculptures?

320
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,359
I found a flower on
the dining room table

321
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,353
and a bird on the
nightstand a few days ago.

322
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,754
It's a swan.

323
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,399
You made them? Yes.

324
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
A new hobby?

325
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,830
No.

326
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,150
It's an interest.

327
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,476
May I bring up something
else I've noticed?

328
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,834
What's that?

329
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,470
You...

330
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,794
Standing in front
of the refrigerator.

331
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,351
Is there a reason you haven't
talked to me about it?

332
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,000
I haven't felt the need to.

333
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,560
Is it bad?

334
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,119
It's not pleasant.

335
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,198
But, no, it's not bad.

336
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,670
What can I do?

337
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,109
Nothing.

338
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,720
If there were something,
I'd ask.

339
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,594
Did you think it was
weird that I called you?

340
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,279
Totally weird.

341
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,677
Except for the fact that I
was planning on calling you.

342
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,553
Really? Why?

343
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,318
<i>I was a real grade-A bitch
to you at The Herald,</i>

344
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,199
and I almost apologized when I
saw you at the White House,

345
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,350
but I chickened out.

346
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,080
So, anyway, I am drunk
enough, and I am sorry.

347
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,832
Why did you call me?

348
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,391
I was just wondering how things were
going at the old stomping ground.

349
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,437
Here you go. Thank you.

350
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,671
It's just not
the same since Tom left.

351
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,639
And I don't blame you
for doing what you did.

352
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,756
But this new guy?

353
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,198
<i>Six years running EW Online does
not a managing editor make.</i>

354
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,592
Would you ever want
to come work with us?

355
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,877
I mean,
it'd be a huge fucking deal.

356
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,112
<i>Chief Political Correspondent of
The Herald moves to Slugline?</i>

357
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,237
Did Carly Heath
put you up to this?

358
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,036
No. Not at all. But if you
want, I could talk to her.

359
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,274
You think she would go for it?

360
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,040
Honestly, I don't know.

361
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,158
She's got this sort of
anti-establishment "fuck you" attitude.

362
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,314
Conventional news bores her.

363
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,477
But if you had
something gritty to show...

364
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,036
I've got a story
if you want it.

365
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,679
It's pretty fucking great.

366
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,399
You would give away a story?

367
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,834
If you're not interested...

368
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,718
No, I'm interested.

369
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,630
If I seem a little hung-over,
it is because I am.

370
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,831
A lot hung-over, actually.

371
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,678
God, I almost had
a couple of months,

372
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,638
and then last night, I...

373
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,230
Well,
I don't remember much,
so...

374
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,631
But anyway, here I am.

375
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,315
Keep coming back.

376
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,754
It works if you work it.

377
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,036
Thank you for sharing, Diane.

378
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,159
I'm Doug, and I'm an alcoholic.

379
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,669
Hi, Doug.

380
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,120
One of the things I do
for a living is count.

381
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,076
I count votes.

382
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,556
Yeas, nays,
neutrals, abstaining.

383
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,239
And I'm good at it.

384
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,514
But the most important count I
do has nothing to do with work.

385
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,912
It's the number of days
since April 4, 1999.

386
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,194
As of this morning,
that's 5,185.

387
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,238
The bigger that number gets,
the more it frightens me,

388
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,154
because I know all it takes is
one drink to go back to zero.

389
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,837
Most people see
fear as a weakness.

390
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,910
It can be.

391
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,872
Sometimes for my job, I have
to put fear in other people.

392
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,680
I know that's not right.

393
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,117
But if I'm honest, like the
fourth step asks us to be,

394
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,032
I have to be ruthless,

395
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,670
because failure
is not an option.

396
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,399
The same goes for my sobriety.

397
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,316
I have to be
ruthless with myself.

398
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,232
I have to use my fear.

399
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,039
It makes me stronger.

400
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,272
Like everyone in this room,
I can't control who I am.

401
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,438
But I can control the zero.

402
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,349
Fuck the zero.

403
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,878
Thanks for sharing. It
works if you work it.

404
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,120
Who would like to share next?

405
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,959
<i>Was he at the meeting? He was.</i>

406
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,320
I tried to find him afterwards,

407
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,959
but he was gone before I
could catch up with him.

408
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
<i>Did he say anything? No.</i>

409
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,115
He never shares.
He looked preoccupied.

410
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,469
You think he'll show
up at the house today?

411
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,829
<i>I have no idea.</i>

412
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,593
He's not answering my calls.

413
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,753
<i>Mine neither. Anything
else I need to know?</i>

414
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,153
I hear silence.
I don't like that sound.

415
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,959
<i>Something came up.
I'm handling it.</i>

416
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,434
Something serious?

417
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,000
Serious but solvable.

418
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,520
Do I wanna know more?

419
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,120
<i>I don't think you do.
We'll be okay.</i>

420
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,193
I might have to involve Nancy.
I'm hoping I won't have to.

421
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,034
<i>But if I do, she'll have no
knowledge of anything damaging.</i>

422
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,998
All right.
Use your best judgment.

423
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,594
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

424
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,359
I've gotta go.

425
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,476
Miss Gallagher?

426
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,192
Can the Congressman
have a moment?

427
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,395
Things are...
They're complicated.

428
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
I realize that,
but he truly needs you.

429
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,390
I don't know what
I could say to him.

430
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,791
I think just showing up would
do him a world of good.

431
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,394
Today is tough. The Speaker
has a full schedule...

432
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,676
Look, I already spoke to Bob,
and he said he'd be fine

433
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,234
if you took
the rest of the day off.

434
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,198
In fact, he said it'd be
fine if you wanted to take

435
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,237
the next six months off. What?

436
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,951
I want you to be
deputy campaign manager.

437
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,157
You work under Nash Aarons.

438
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,954
No. I spent years being Peter's crutch.
If you just want me there...

439
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,555
Well, of course we want you there
to help, but not as a crutch.

440
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,919
Peter is a talented young man
with a lot of potential.

441
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,434
He knows this,

442
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,274
but he needs to hear it
from someone other than me.

443
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,993
Someone he truly cares about.

444
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,158
I'm sorry.
This is just a lot right now.

445
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,873
Well, you don't have to
make a decision now,

446
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,076
but at least talk to Peter.

447
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,157
I mean, there's no harm
in that, now, is there?

448
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,720
10 grand.

449
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,674
We divert it from
your campaign accounts.

450
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,796
We itemize it
so it looks like...

451
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,036
Wait.

452
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
You want me to pay for this?

453
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,994
Use Frank's re-election fund.

454
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,197
Commissioner, the majority of
the money that you've raised

455
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,714
has come from people
we've sent your way.

456
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,918
And you sent them because I sprung
your boy, Russo, in the first place.

457
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,351
We're even.
I don't owe you shit.

458
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,241
There's a girl in trouble.
Let's help her out.

459
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,156
Not my problem.

460
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,230
It could be.

461
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,710
We put her back on the streets,

462
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,876
there's no telling
what she could do.

463
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,351
I'm a hell of a lot more
afraid of the U.S. Attorney

464
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,440
than I am of some hooker.

465
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,513
This is a very inexpensive
insurance policy.

466
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,193
I already broke
the law once, Doug.

467
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,919
There's no fucking way
I'm gonna mess

468
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,753
with campaign
finance regulations.

469
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,559
I don't even wanna
be hearing this shit.

470
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,877
Funeral for the former ambassador
of Japan tomorrow at 9:30,

471
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,276
followed by a luncheon with the
National Board of Directors

472
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,238
for the Girl Scouts of America.

473
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,039
Mr. President. Jim.

474
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,873
After that, you've got a meet
and greet with the finalist...

475
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,429
I'll catch up with you
in a minute.

476
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,155
This way, sir.

477
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,390
Hi.

478
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,350
Hey.

479
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,070
What are you doing here?

480
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,400
The Congressman
wanted me to come over.

481
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,030
Why?

482
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,236
He wants me to work
for your campaign.

483
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,114
Deputy manager. Frank!

484
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,311
He said you're
having some doubts.

485
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,280
I was just about to tell him
that I decided not to run.

486
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,478
Okay.
If you've made up your mind,

487
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,512
then I should
probably get going.

488
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,320
Did he tell you about the whole plan?
About coming clean?

489
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,110
Yeah, he did.

490
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,440
I have Kevin and Sarah
to think about.

491
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,512
Everyone has a past.
Not like mine.

492
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
You don't know half the
things I've done, Christina.

493
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,795
My kids read. Their friends read.
I can't take that chance.

494
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,273
Look, if you don't want to
run, then you shouldn't.

495
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,954
I do wanna run. I wouldn't have

496
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,640
let it go this far
if I didn't want it.

497
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,358
Then maybe it's a good thing,

498
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,671
confronting your past,
even for your kids.

499
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,560
They're a lot stronger than
you give them credit for.

500
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,237
Look, if Underwood, if the DNC,

501
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,472
if they all think
you can do it, then...

502
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,950
I don't care what they think.
I care what you think.

503
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,590
I think you'd be great.

504
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,840
So, she really wants this?

505
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,519
That's the impression I got.

506
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,276
What about ego? I don't need
to be dealing with a diva.

507
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,430
She's not a diva,

508
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,433
she's an award-winning journalist
with 15 years experience.

509
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,671
You told me
she treated you like shit.

510
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,075
There was some friction.

511
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,435
So why are you
going to bat for her?

512
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,200
Don't we want to work
with the best people?

513
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,760
Plus, it'd be big for the site.

514
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,513
<i>The Herald's senior
political writer?</i>

515
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,761
Sure, but she's so old guard.
Everything's by the book.

516
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,956
There's no bite to it.

517
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,032
She told me about a
profile she's working on.

518
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,156
It's got serious bite.

519
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,390
What is it?

520
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,354
She can tell you herself.
You should talk to her.

521
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,273
Here's the deal.

522
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
My children stay
out of the limelight.

523
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,234
No photo ops, no press.

524
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,195
We wouldn't dream of it.

525
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,070
Okay.

526
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,714
Let's do this.

527
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,355
No.

528
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,436
Where you from?

529
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,076
Outside of Lynchburg.

530
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,435
Virginia?

531
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,510
Yeah.

532
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,237
Are your parents still living there?
No. I can't.

533
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,112
If I find a place for you
to stay for a while,

534
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,152
can I count on you to be smart?

535
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,239
What kind of place?
A nice place.

536
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,719
A safe place until we can
figure out something permanent.

537
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,792
But I need to know that you won't
pull anything like this again.

538
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,960
Promise me.

539
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,076
I promise.

540
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,913
Look at me when you say it.

541
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,795
I promise you.

542
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,113
How you doing on money?

543
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,638
I don't have
enough for tomorrow.

544
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,469
What are you doing?

545
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,234
I thought you wanted me to...

546
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,919
You said you were
done with that.

547
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,874
I'll be in touch.

548
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,271
If you own up to
some of the shenanigans,

549
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,000
sweep the rest under the
rug, you might have a shot.

550
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,639
How much do we
have to sweep under?

551
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,876
Well, that kid had a talent
for covering his tracks.

552
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,400
I've highlighted all the items
I think you should admit to.

553
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,437
The rest I wouldn't mention.

554
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,832
It's a lot not to talk about.

555
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,473
I need your help with something.
Right now?

556
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,960
Yes. Is it important?

557
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,599
Because you told me I could
leave early this weekend

558
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,876
to go visit my daughter
down in Virginia.

559
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,480
You have a guest room
in your house, right?

560
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,758
Well, it's Mary's
old room, but, yes.

561
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,395
I need you to put someone up for a while.
A young woman.

562
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,675
What? Who?

563
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,029
Her name is Rachel.

564
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,520
I can't tell you
anymore than that.

565
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,829
I don't understand.
Why do you need...

566
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,555
No questions, Nancy. I just
need you to do this for me.

567
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,400
I wouldn't be asking
if it weren't serious.

568
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,914
Put up for how long?

569
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,832
I don't know.
It could be a while.

570
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,674
I'm supposed to put up a complete
stranger and not ask any questions?

571
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,832
Nancy, please. You're the
only person I can trust.

572
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
Is something illegal going on?

573
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,120
No. She's just a girl in trouble
who needs a place to stay.

574
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,276
We have to be discreet.

575
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,510
Can I at least meet her first?

576
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,750
I need to know now.

577
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,756
Okay, I guess.

578
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,000
Thank you.

579
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,440
There's no catch, Larry.

580
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,036
Your district gets over $20
million if the numbers hold.

581
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,274
And most of
the money is earmarked

582
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,959
for economic development,
not research.

583
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,513
That's great, but I need
more than your support.

584
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,273
I need you to be a sponsor.

585
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,320
Fantastic, Larry.

586
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,392
Great. I'll put you down.

587
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,634
You too. Bye.

588
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,556
So that just leaves
Clayburn and Price?

589
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,960
With Jennings on the fence.

590
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,474
And I know Roger.
I'll call him.

591
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,600
And I'll track down these
other two over the weekend.

592
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,871
Really good work today, Peter.

593
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,199
Do you know
where I put my purse?

594
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,714
It's right here.

595
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,553
Did you make those? I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

596
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,712
This? I've been fooling
around with it a little bit.

597
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,995
Can I see?

598
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,680
Sarah learned how to make
these birds in her art class.

599
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Then she taught it to Kevin,
and they got obsessed,

600
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,718
and there were little pieces of
paper all over the apartment.

601
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,200
Do you wanna take
them for the kids?

602
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,680
No. I can't.

603
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,753
Please. I'll just throw
them out eventually.

604
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,991
Thank you. They'll love them.

605
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,915
So you should bring the kids by the
house sometime so I can meet them.

606
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,356
Kevin and Frank can
play the video games.

607
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,756
He told you that?

608
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,996
I was a little surprised,
I have to admit.

609
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,436
If anybody knew he came
home every day to...

610
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,840
It's embarrassing.

611
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,354
There's worse secrets to have.

612
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,514
Yeah, there are, I suppose.

613
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,511
I'll call you Monday after I
talk to Clayburn and Price.

614
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,193
Okay, great.
Have a good weekend, Peter.

615
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,999
You too.

616
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,077
I had Linda talk to
the Vice President.

617
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,150
He'll keep his nose out of it.

618
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,270
I appreciate that.

619
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,353
He's a good man, but this is a very
delicate moment in the campaign.

620
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,436
He starts
spreading doubts, and...

621
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,510
He's a pain in the ass.

622
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,200
We all know it. You don't
have to mince words, Frank.

623
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,436
I have to say, sir, the
Vice President has a point.

624
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,274
I'm not 100% sold on Russo.

625
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,830
Do we really wanna go with
someone this untested?

626
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,195
Frank?

627
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,675
We're grooming him, sir.

628
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,274
When do you announce?
Next month.

629
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,350
That's not enough time.

630
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,470
What do you see in him?

631
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,315
I was wondering the same thing.
There's not that much to see.

632
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,317
What I see is a recovering alcoholic
with a history of drug abuse.

633
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,913
What? Excuse me, Frank?

634
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,356
But he's clean now.
Has been for a year.

635
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,636
This is a redemption story,
Mr. President.

636
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,320
This is a bright young man who's
put his life back on track.

637
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Now he wants to help put
Pennsylvania back on track.

638
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,994
Drugs, Frank?

639
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,877
People love an underdog, Linda,

640
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,241
and people love someone who
stands up after they've fallen.

641
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,877
Combine those two, it's a
very powerful narrative.

642
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,840
All of our polling indicates
this is gonna work.

643
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,719
You want us to endorse someone
with a history of substance abuse?

644
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,759
Let us get his story out there and
watch it connect with the voters.

645
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,399
All I care about
is a win, Frank.

646
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,392
And I believe Russo
is our best chance.

647
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,000
This is not a Hail Mary,
Mr. President,

648
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,520
this is
a well-thought-out game plan.

649
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,636
Mr. President...

650
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,189
I realize that I sometimes
think out of the box,

651
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,990
but the last time I did, we
signed an education bill.

652
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,919
All right.
We won't stand in your way.

653
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,121
But if it backfires, Frank...

654
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,311
I'll guide Peter
every step along the way.

655
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,153
We will not
disappoint you, Mr. President.

656
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,670
Okay.

657
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,110
Thank you, sir.

658
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,114
Linda.

659
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,715
I didn't plan on telling
them so much so soon,

660
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,269
but if I didn't, Linda
would've swayed him.

661
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,829
There's no better way to
overpower a trickle of doubt

662
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,673
than with a flood
of naked truth.

663
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,991
This is why the Education
Bill was so important.

664
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,397
It bought me influence precisely
when I needed it most.

665
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,200
How long have you
been drinking?

666
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,556
A long time. Since I was a kid.

667
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,677
How old were you when you
had your first drink?

668
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,836
Nine.

669
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,274
Nine years old? Yeah.

670
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,080
My dad gave me a beer
for my ninth birthday.

671
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,834
When did you first
start using drugs?

672
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,833
I won't go into
too many specifics

673
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,355
other than to say I had
a few minor brushes

674
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,279
with marijuana and cocaine in
the past but not recently,

675
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,481
and only a handful of times.

676
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,355
No other drugs besides
marijuana and cocaine?

677
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,476
No.

678
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,795
Under what circumstances?

679
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,793
Occasional social gatherings.
That's the most I'll say.

680
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,678
Ever while you were
in public office?

681
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,991
No. Never.
My chief problem
was alcohol.

682
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,111
And you've been
sober how long now?

683
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,475
A little over a year.

684
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,438
And what made you
want to get sober?

685
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,555
Two things.

686
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,240
My children, whom I love more
than anything else in the world,

687
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,719
and my renewed faith in God.

688
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,390
Zoe.

689
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,870
Lucas.

690
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,753
I was just in the neighborhood,
and I thought...

691
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,674
No. That's a lie. I was at
the bar around the corner.

692
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,712
The one with the...

693
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,719
And I remembered that time that
I dropped you off after work.

694
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,760
I knew it was...

695
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,240
This block.

696
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,712
And I buzzed,
and then I waited...

697
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,916
You're wasted.

698
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,110
I'm pretty wasted.

699
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,672
Do you wanna know a deep,
dark secret?

700
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,835
Now we don't work together...

701
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,680
Anymore.

702
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,830
Lucas...

703
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,679
I'm really flattered.

704
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,359
But I'm just not in a place

705
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,717
where I'm even thinking
romantically right now.

706
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,073
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,310
I...

708
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,030
Yeah.

709
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,675
Hey, hey!

710
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,510
You want me to
pull up now, sir?

711
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,880
I still have my key.

712
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,710
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need anything.

713
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,154
Thank you.

714
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,837
Hey, I got us wine, but I can't
find a corkscrew anywhere.

715
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,434
Give it to me.

716
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,914
I need a pen.

717
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,076
The pen the President gave you?

718
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,150
That'll work.

719
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,434
Did you talk to Ms. Skorsky?

720
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,310
I did. She said it was intense.

721
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,991
<i>I think Carly's gonna offer
her a job at Slugline.</i>

722
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,309
Was that your doing?

723
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,795
Janine expressed interest.

724
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,239
I took the next step.

725
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,114
Well done. Always
good to be owed favors.

726
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,671
I was wondering. Do you
ever think about my age?

727
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,114
No. Does my age bother you?

728
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,441
You must have other lovers,
men that are younger than me.

729
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,119
No. Not that I would mind.

730
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,192
I am married, after all.

731
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,035
I don't have time
for other lovers.

732
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,110
Hmm.

733
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,230
Shit.

734
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,712
It's turned. Give me that.

735
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,196
You could've
just stepped on it.

736
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,310
I have asked the super to get
an exterminator in here,

737
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,516
and he won't do it.

738
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,990
So any time I see a cockroach,
or a spider, or whatever,

739
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,549
I try and trap it, and then
I leave it by his door.

740
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,634
You really ought to get your parents
to let you borrow some money.

741
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,552
Then you wouldn't have to
live in the third world.

742
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,996
I would never
take money from them.

743
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,401
Because they don't have it,
or because you don't want it?

744
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,840
Because I don't want it.

745
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,755
It's Father's Day, you know.

746
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,396
It is?

747
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,880
You should call your father.

748
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,915
I'll call him tomorrow.

749
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,161
Tomorrow you'll be the daughter
that forgot Father's Day

750
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,561
instead of
the one who remembered.

751
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,439
Go ahead. Call him.

752
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,030
Hey, Dad. Sorry it's so late.

753
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,555
'Cause you weren't home the
last time I called her.

754
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,111
There's so little she'll ever
reveal to me or I to her.

755
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,357
I bet her father
knows even less.

756
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,194
I'm sure she's speaking
half an octave higher.

757
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,511
Same voice she had
when she was 16.

758
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,599
Telling him all about her new
job, how much she misses him,

759
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,797
and sorry she didn't
send a card.

760
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,634
Telling him everything
but the truth.

761
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,031
Just like she wouldn't tell me
about that young man downstairs.

762
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,634
I'm calling now, all right?

763
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,313
You're gonna make
me feel bad about it.

764
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,878
It was the best thing
that could've happened.

765
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,110
I didn't fit in there.

766
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,314
I've been called worse, Dad.

767
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,711
There's a value
in having secrets.

768
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,713
Creatures like myself,
like Claire, like Zoe,

769
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,315
we wouldn't be
ourselves without them.

770
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,314
But Peter Russo, on the other hand,
he's trapped by his secrets.

771
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,357
What I'm trying to do is
give him the opportunity

772
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,834
to set himself free.

773
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,309
I don't know.

774
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,755
I don't know yet.

775
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,834
After all, we are nothing more or
less than what we choose to reveal.

776
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,151
What I am to Claire is
not what I am to Zoe,

777
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,039
just as Zoe is not to me
what she is to her father.

778
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,958
Probably Thanksgiving.

779
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,597
'Cause I don't think I can
make it back before then.

780
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,870
Okay. I'll try.

781
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,990
I said I'll try.

782
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,714
For Christmas?

783
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,595
No.

784
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,830
Uh-uh.

785
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,156
No. I'm not seeing
anyone right now.

786
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,199
I don't feel like it.

787
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,234
Because I'm not
interested in that.

788
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,835
I would tell you, Dad.

789
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,590
Uh-huh.

790
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,110
Yeah.

791
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,510
Okay.

792
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,120
Don't be worried about me.
I'm fine.

793
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,116
Yeah.

794
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,072
Dad, I'm in...

795
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm in a really
great place right now.

796
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,434
I'm gonna try.

797
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,520
I'm gonna try to come, okay?

798
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,319
Happy Father's Day.

799
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,952
Aren't you gonna wish me
a happy Father's Day?

800
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,240
You don't have any children.

801
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,236
Don't I?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
