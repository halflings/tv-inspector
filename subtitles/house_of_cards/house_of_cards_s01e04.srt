1
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,960
It's there for leverage

2
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,087
so that we can lock down
performance standards.

3
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,922
You don't toss around their
right to collective bargaining

4
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,174
like a poker chip.

5
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:52,134
If we don't, they won't budge.

6
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:54,094
Has Marty Spinella seen this?

7
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:55,764
Not the version I showed him.

8
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:57,182
So you lied to his face.

9
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,934
No. I revised the parameters of my promise.

10
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:00,935
Which is lying.

11
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:02,187
Which is politics...

12
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,564
the sort you're well versed in, Bob.

13
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,024
Here's some politics for you.

14
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:07,818
I allow this to go to the floor,

15
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,861
I get murdered next election.

16
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,863
This is coming from the President.

17
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,449
Last time I checked,

18
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,117
I was still a Democrat, Frank,

19
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,536
and you were too.

20
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,746
Are you telling me the President isn't?

21
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:21,624
Because he's acting a hell
of a lot like a Republican.

22
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,292
I thought Bob was on our team.

23
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,712
Just sit him down with
the President ten minutes.

24
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,547
We won't touch collective bargaining.

25
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,340
Are you interested in my advice on this,

26
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:30,842
or do you just want me
to deliver the message?

27
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:32,678
I'm always interested
in your advice, Frank.

28
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:35,138
Birch is right. You're going
to burn a lot of bridges.

29
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:36,765
The President should at
least sit down with him

30
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:37,974
and let him make his case.

31
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,643
You tell Bob

32
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:41,729
I'm happy to schedule a
meeting with the President

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,231
once he's set a date to
put this bill on the floor.

34
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,816
The President can fuck himself.

35
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,276
This is the platform. It's what he ran on.

36
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:50,111
I don't give a shit what he ran on.

37
00:02:50,113 --> 00:02:52,741
He can't steamroll the house.

38
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:53,907
And don't forget,

39
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,243
you work for me, Frank, not him.

40
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,703
If he wants something on the floor,

41
00:02:56,704 --> 00:02:58,996
he's gonna have to talk to me directly.

42
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,750
I know you take a lot of
pride in your manhood, Bob,

43
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:03,334
and it's impressive,

44
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:04,669
but as big as it is,

45
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,629
Linda can still shut the door on it.

46
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,884
Tell Vasquez the bill is dead.

47
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,514
That's not the first time

48
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:17,099
he's pulled that stunt on me.

49
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,475
Probably should have held my tongue,

50
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,976
but I just couldn't resist the chance

51
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,270
to see him shrivel.

52
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:25,982
Good morning.

53
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,192
Frank.

54
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:29,571
Mr. President.

55
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:31,281
Linda.

56
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:33,700
Let's strike the anti-collective
bargaining provision

57
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:34,868
from the bill.

58
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:36,160
Linda and I have talked it over,

59
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,704
and I think she's right on this.

60
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,539
Tell Bob he can come by tomorrow afternoon.

61
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,332
Sir, respectfully, I do not think

62
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,167
you should give him the satisfaction.

63
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,252
Well, give me a reason.

64
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:45,670
Makes us appear weak.

65
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:47,088
There's an opportunity for you

66
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,466
to establish your supremacy.

67
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:49,842
We should seize it.

68
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,176
But without Birch's cooperation,

69
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,595
we're fighting an uphill battle

70
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,388
before we even get the bill to the floor.

71
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:55,473
Frank, we discussed this.

72
00:03:55,474 --> 00:03:56,766
Sir, if you give in now,

73
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,643
Birch will walk all over you

74
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:00,144
for the next four years.

75
00:04:00,145 --> 00:04:02,688
I can get this bill on
the house floor as is.

76
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,148
I promise you.

77
00:04:07,945 --> 00:04:09,571
All right, Frank. Show me what you can do.

78
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:10,823
Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:17,537
That was her trying to
take credit for my idea.

80
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:20,332
Advice she wouldn't take
from me... unacceptable.

81
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,125
I will not allow her to sell my goods

82
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:24,210
when she cuts me out of the profits.

83
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,130
I specifically told her no interviews.

84
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,465
She disobeyed me...

85
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:28,842
not just once.

86
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,301
At least eight times in the past month.

87
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,719
She stays, Tom.

88
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,180
She has no respect for
my authority, Margaret.

89
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:36,265
I said she stays.

90
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,642
There are rules.

91
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:38,852
There's a way of doing things.

92
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:39,894
If I have a reporter...

93
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,312
two freshmen girls

94
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:43,189
are moving into their dorm room together.

95
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,483
One of them's from Georgia,

96
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,234
one of them's from Connecticut.

97
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:48,111
The girl from Connecticut's
helping her mother

98
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:49,363
put up curtains.

99
00:04:49,364 --> 00:04:50,865
The girl from Georgia turns to them

100
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,908
and says, "hi. Where y'all from?"

101
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,243
The girl from Connecticut
says, "we're from a place

102
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:57,913
where we know not to end a
sentence with a preposition."

103
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:01,834
The girl from Georgia
says, "oh, beg my pardon.

104
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:03,085
Where y'all from...

105
00:05:03,086 --> 00:05:04,086
Cunt?"

106
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,006
You heard that one before?

107
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,926
A version of it. With softer language.

108
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,761
Tom, we don't need people
who follow the rules.

109
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,471
We need people with personality.

110
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:17,017
We want Zoe's face, her energy.

111
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,143
We want to get her on
TV as much as possible.

112
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,730
It helps us cut through the noise.

113
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,148
See what I'm saying?

114
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:26,151
I hear you, Margaret.

115
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:28,404
Thank you, Tom.

116
00:05:31,114 --> 00:05:32,700
Thank you.

117
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:39,080
Come in.

118
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:43,837
Oh. I, uh, thought...

119
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:46,965
I wanted to say hi to Evelyn.

120
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:48,884
Evelyn?

121
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,260
This was her office.

122
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:52,303
I don't think she works here anymore.

123
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:54,096
- Oh.
- Gillian Cole.

124
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:55,766
I came on board a couple of weeks ago.

125
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,267
Gillian. World well.

126
00:05:57,268 --> 00:05:58,936
Yeah.

127
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,145
I've heard great things.

128
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,230
Remy Danton.

129
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:03,190
You work with Claire?

130
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:04,233
In a way.

131
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,777
Hello, Remy.

132
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,194
Claire.

133
00:06:07,195 --> 00:06:08,696
I see you've met Gillian.

134
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:09,989
Yes, just now.

135
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,741
She's doing fantastic work for us,

136
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,034
as you can see.

137
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:14,577
Red is completed wells,

138
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:17,329
green, uh, potential sites,

139
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:18,665
yellow approved sites,

140
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,167
and blue are the filtration centers.

141
00:06:21,168 --> 00:06:23,754
Nice. So you liking it here?

142
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:25,798
Yeah. My staff and I are loving it.

143
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,340
Claire's opened a lot of doors for us.

144
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:28,801
Sounds like Claire.

145
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,761
Shall we head to my office?

146
00:06:30,762 --> 00:06:32,304
Gillian, nice to meet you.

147
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,973
Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:33,974 --> 00:06:35,181
What happened?

149
00:06:35,182 --> 00:06:37,810
Things got complicated.

150
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,897
San corp was in a difficult situation.

151
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,398
I would have thought you'd step up

152
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,817
when things were difficult,

153
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:45,652
not hold the donation hostage.

154
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:47,570
Well, things are less complicated now.

155
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:49,656
The donation is back on the table.

156
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,201
I had to fire half my staff.

157
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,453
Now you can hire them back.

158
00:06:55,455 --> 00:06:56,831
San corp is prepared

159
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:58,415
to double its initial commitment...

160
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:01,293
1.5 million, lump sum, this quarter.

161
00:07:01,294 --> 00:07:03,462
- Why?
- Public relations. Same as before.

162
00:07:03,463 --> 00:07:05,631
And what do they want from Francis?

163
00:07:06,757 --> 00:07:08,174
Things are square with Frank.

164
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:09,510
We're only talking about the C.W.I.

165
00:07:09,511 --> 00:07:10,636
But why double it?

166
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:11,971
Because I said they should.

167
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:13,764
The more they give, the more you can do.

168
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,017
The more you can do, the better they look.

169
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,061
And that's why they hired Glendon Hill...

170
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,146
to make them look good.

171
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,313
And they also hired you

172
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,481
to get traction in congress.

173
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,816
Not in this case.

174
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,027
We want a long-term partnership, Claire.

175
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,278
This is an investment in the future.

176
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,197
We're not attaching strings.

177
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:32,450
I'll think about it.

178
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,243
They'd really love to move quickly on this.

179
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,914
I said I'll think about it.

180
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,249
Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.

181
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,584
I need it in writing.

182
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,462
And with more than an hour's notice.

183
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,673
Yeah, I know that, but
you have to understand

184
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,008
we... we have a plan.

185
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,634
We have a way that we do this,

186
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,844
and when you...

187
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,725
okay.

188
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,309
Fine.

189
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,312
Yeah. Yeah. Bye.

190
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,359
Madeleine has decided to have

191
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,486
a spur-of-the-moment trip to Orlando

192
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,488
with her latest eharmony catch.

193
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,531
No heads-up, no warning.

194
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,615
The kids?

195
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,368
They get out of school at 2:30.

196
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:14,453
I can do the shipbuilders meeting.

197
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,164
You sure?

198
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,249
Yeah, it's just a public affairs team.

199
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,334
I'll brief you, and then
you can call them tomorrow.

200
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,711
Go get your kids.

201
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,936
Hey.

202
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,652
Remy came by this morning. To the office.

203
00:08:45,653 --> 00:08:46,904
What does he want?

204
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,447
The donation's back on the table.

205
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,325
They've doubled it to 1.5 million.

206
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:53,828
- You said no, right?
- I didn't.

207
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:56,873
He doesn't want anything from you, Francis.

208
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:58,917
Come on, Claire. You know better than that.

209
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,585
I specifically asked.

210
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:01,920
Maybe not right now,

211
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:04,589
but look, I invented this guy, all right?

212
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,007
It's a slippery slope. You open the...

213
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,801
Think of what I can do with this money.

214
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,386
I can hire back the people I let go.

215
00:09:09,387 --> 00:09:10,846
I can help accelerate the funding

216
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,848
for the projects that
Gillian has brought in.

217
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,767
Let's find another way to raise the money.

218
00:09:14,768 --> 00:09:16,435
But it's right there at my feet.

219
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,980
Claire, I have too much
on my plate right now.

220
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:21,149
I can't have San corp
breathing down my neck again.

221
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,733
I can't have Remy...

222
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:24,110
look, it is Remy.

223
00:09:24,111 --> 00:09:26,237
He knows me too well. It's dangerous.

224
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:29,532
Look at the bigger picture here.

225
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:32,828
I'm asking.

226
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:34,955
No. You're not.

227
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:41,920
Claire.

228
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,339
I'll tell you what I told him.

229
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,674
Which was?

230
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:47,010
I'll think about it.

231
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,687
I know there's been some tension,

232
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,439
and I'm probably more
to blame than you are.

233
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,233
But I'd like to put that behind us.

234
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,610
Zoe,

235
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,905
you're going to be our new
White House correspondent.

236
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,283
What about Janine?

237
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,535
I promoted her to Midwest Bureau chief.

238
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:12,995
She's okay with that?

239
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:14,371
She wants to give up the White House?

240
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:15,956
It's the decision I've made.

241
00:10:15,957 --> 00:10:19,543
It's just that Janine
has so much experience.

242
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:21,337
I thought you'd be more excited about this.

243
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:25,841
I'm sorry. I... I just
thought you brought me in here

244
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:27,844
to... I don't know.

245
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:29,470
To fire you.

246
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,681
Maybe.

247
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:34,309
Water under the bridge.

248
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,560
We're starting over.

249
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,814
So are you ready to take this on?

250
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,817
Can I think about it?

251
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:45,821
People usually don't have to think about it

252
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:47,365
when they're offered the White House, Zoe.

253
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,699
Just a day or two.

254
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,284
Janine is booked for a flight

255
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,451
to Chicago on Friday.

256
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,828
I'll let you know before then.

257
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,164
I just need to...

258
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,541
thank you. Thank you, Tom.

259
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:07,261
David Rasmussen is the majority leader,

260
00:11:07,262 --> 00:11:08,762
which means he's one step above me

261
00:11:08,763 --> 00:11:10,264
and one below Birch,

262
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:12,307
which is akin to being
between a very hungry wolf

263
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:13,725
and a very quarrelsome sheep.

264
00:11:13,726 --> 00:11:15,394
Let's see if he stays with the herd

265
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:16,770
or joins the pack.

266
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,688
David. You mind if I join you?

267
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:21,024
Please. A salad, huh?

268
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,361
Yes. I'm trying to take
better care of myself.

269
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:24,695
Good man. Diet?

270
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:26,989
Diet, exercise, everything.

271
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,535
You ought to take better
care of yourself too.

272
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,829
Well, they should stop
serving such good pizza.

273
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,332
Oh, I'm not talking about the food.

274
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,126
I'm talking about Birch.

275
00:11:40,296 --> 00:11:42,214
You are never going to be speaker

276
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,632
unless you do something about it.

277
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,508
I'm very satisfied where I am.

278
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:47,552
- Oh, come on.
- For the time being, yeah.

279
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:48,678
Time being never.

280
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,264
The only way you become speaker

281
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,266
is if Birch loses his district or retires,

282
00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:53,642
neither of which is going to happen

283
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:55,394
before you and I have dentures.

284
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,020
I'm not happy where this
conversation is going, Frank.

285
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:59,356
If you want it, and I know you do,

286
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,733
there's a way.

287
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:02,484
Okay. Right. I can't...

288
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,322
all you need is a simple
majority... 218 votes.

289
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:07,740
We're going to get at
least 205 out of the G.O.P.,

290
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,491
and after that, all you
need is 13 Democrats.

291
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,202
You and I make two.

292
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:12,454
Are you out of your mind?

293
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:17,417
Just consider it for a moment.

294
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,212
You want to collude with the Republicans?

295
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,630
I don't want to, but I would

296
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,382
if you become speaker in the process.

297
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,591
Never been done before.

298
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,718
There's a first time for everything.

299
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,012
This is ridiculous.

300
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,347
The Republicans would love a chance

301
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,265
to knock Bob down a peg or two.

302
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,475
And you want to help them.

303
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,976
I want to help us.

304
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:37,438
Bob will not play ball
with the White House.

305
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,858
Now, you're a reasonable
man, David, and he's not.

306
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,488
You know what I am?

307
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:46,239
I'm a discreet man.

308
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,531
You're lucky for that.

309
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,368
I'm not going to mention this to Bob,

310
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:51,244
but if you ever bring it up again,

311
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:53,246
I won't have a choice.

312
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,503
Looks like he opted for the herd.

313
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,887
Claire. I'd like to put an
order for the water filters

314
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,515
and the well-digging equipment
for the South Sudan project.

315
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:11,640
Can we talk about the budget?

316
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:13,809
- How much?
- 200,000.

317
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:15,020
For one project?

318
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:16,897
I know it's a lot, but it'll be

319
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:18,815
our flagship project in Africa,

320
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:20,775
and we would be the
first organization there

321
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:22,152
to work on this scale.

322
00:13:22,153 --> 00:13:24,570
I'd like to go over the specifics first.

323
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,947
I have the budget right here.

324
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:27,115
Let me just grab my messages,

325
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,325
and then I'll come in to you.

326
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:30,827
Okay. I'll be in my office.

327
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,454
Any calls while I was out?

328
00:13:32,456 --> 00:13:35,833
They're on the desk, and
this came by messenger.

329
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:17,419
Adam. It's Claire.

330
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:23,174
Yes. I know. It has.

331
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,429
No reason. I was just thinking about you.

332
00:14:30,015 --> 00:14:32,059
You're right. It is a lie.

333
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,145
I do have a reason.

334
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:36,314
I need to use you.

335
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,107
The White House is where news goes to die.

336
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:39,650
Everything's canned.

337
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:41,152
These perfectly prepared statements...

338
00:14:41,153 --> 00:14:42,487
it's a prestigious job, Zoe.

339
00:14:42,488 --> 00:14:44,822
Used to be, when I was in ninth grade.

340
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,365
Now it's a graveyard.

341
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:48,618
The only halfway interesting thing they do

342
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,496
is throw a big dinner party once a year

343
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:51,955
where they pat themselves on the back

344
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:53,999
and rub shoulders with movie stars.

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,208
Who needs that?

346
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,709
Every day since you started here,

347
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,337
you've begged me to move you up, and now...

348
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,588
my goal in life is not

349
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:01,381
to climb up the herald's ladder

350
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,509
one rung at a time until
I've got my own stationery.

351
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,969
Some of us value a career
at a paper like this.

352
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,555
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for that to come off...

353
00:15:08,557 --> 00:15:10,975
well, it did, and you skipped
a few rungs, by the way.

354
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,310
Do what you want to do, Zoe,

355
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,061
but if you want me to be your cheerleader

356
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,771
and say, "yeah, turn it down," I won't.

357
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:17,482
I would have killed for that job

358
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:18,858
when I first started here.

359
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,327
Put Fichtner in the "leaning yes" column.

360
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,995
Don't you think he's a neutral?

361
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,121
He hates Birch.

362
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,289
Yeah, but he owes Birch

363
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,541
for the ways and means appointment.

364
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:35,000
Put him in "neutral." Who else?

365
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:38,795
Ramirez is a neutral?

366
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:41,006
Oh, this list is so shaky.

367
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,757
Any one of them leaks it to Bob...

368
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,301
no, what we need is one name,

369
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:47,763
one person who can deliver 12.

370
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:50,433
The black caucus.

371
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:54,479
Womack.

372
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,647
What can we offer him?

373
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:56,772
What does he need?

374
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:58,400
Let me pull up his file.

375
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:03,988
Here we go.

376
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,491
McCudden air force base

377
00:16:05,492 --> 00:16:07,284
employs 3,000 people in his district.

378
00:16:07,285 --> 00:16:08,994
It's on the D.O.D.'s
chopping block this year.

379
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:10,580
Who do we know on the Brack commission?

380
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:12,415
That's dangerous.

381
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,832
The trail leads back to us

382
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,418
trying to influence
the D.O.D. or the Brack.

383
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,587
No, no, no. What we do
is we close another base.

384
00:16:17,588 --> 00:16:19,505
We leave enough money
in the D.O.D.'s budget

385
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:21,674
to keep Womack's base off the list.

386
00:16:21,675 --> 00:16:23,092
What we need...

387
00:16:28,473 --> 00:16:30,517
Is someone we own.

388
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,439
Dad, I'm hungry.

389
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,565
Coming, buddy.

390
00:16:36,566 --> 00:16:38,900
Here we go.

391
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:41,278
With cheese.

392
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,363
Without cheese.

393
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:45,408
Um, dad?

394
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:46,618
Yeah.

395
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,786
That looks pretty disgusting.

396
00:16:49,787 --> 00:16:51,664
Yeah, it looks disgusting.

397
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:54,459
It's not how it looks, it's how it tastes.

398
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,461
And a fork would be nice.

399
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,630
Shit. Okay. Hold on.

400
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,969
Hello.

401
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,554
Good evening, Mr. Russo.

402
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:07,097
There's a Mr. Underwood here to see you.

403
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:10,142
Uh... Okay. Send him up.

404
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,241
Hi, there.

405
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,285
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,203
This is Kevin, this is Sara.

407
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:31,331
Hi. I'm Frank. Nice to meet you both.

408
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:33,082
- Do you work with dad?
- I do.

409
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,084
Congressman Underwood is daddy's boss.

410
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,920
I thought you didn't have a boss.

411
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,006
Everybody has a boss, sweetheart,

412
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:40,716
even congressmen.

413
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,092
Why don't you take your
dinner and go into the bedroom?

414
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,219
- But I wanted to watch TV.
- Go now.

415
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,472
Cute kids.

416
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,807
Yeah, I like them.

417
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:48,974
Can I get you a drink?

418
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:50,976
No, I won't be here long.

419
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,187
Yeah. Have a seat.

420
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:54,438
Oh, thanks.

421
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,398
Is that a ps vita?

422
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,526
Uh...

423
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:01,780
Which games does he have?

424
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:03,281
All of them.

425
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,491
I have a console at home.

426
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,992
I play sometimes to relax.

427
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:08,161
I ought to get one of these for the car.

428
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:14,083
So, Peter, we need to close the shipyard

429
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:15,293
in your district.

430
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,671
The Brack hearing is tomorrow.

431
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:18,172
You won't put up your usual fight.

432
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,299
You have zero testimony to add.

433
00:18:22,092 --> 00:18:23,553
I can't do that.

434
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:24,804
Yes, you can, Peter.

435
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,347
I spent months on that testimony.

436
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:28,766
I lobbied the commission.
My entire office...

437
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,476
I'm sure you've done splendid work,

438
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,395
but unfortunately it
can't come to fruition.

439
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,397
- Why?
- Politics.

440
00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:36,567
There's forces bigger than
either of us at play here.

441
00:18:36,568 --> 00:18:37,901
It's 12,000 jobs.

442
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:39,444
I know. It's a shame.

443
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,613
Keeping that shipyard open
is what got me elected.

444
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:43,114
Those people are my friends.

445
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,242
I'm not here to debate this, Peter.

446
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,411
The base will close.

447
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:48,995
The only question is, will you make it

448
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,789
a swift death or a painful one?

449
00:18:52,374 --> 00:18:54,710
No way. I won't sit on my hands.

450
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:57,589
I sympathize that this is
gonna be difficult for you.

451
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,340
And I don't know how yet,

452
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:02,343
but I will make it up to you, Peter.

453
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:05,555
I'm a powerful friend to have right now,

454
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:07,557
perhaps your only friend,

455
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,268
so don't defy me.

456
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:24,450
Love of family.

457
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:26,619
Most politicians are permanently chained

458
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,413
to that slogan... family values.

459
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:31,206
But when you cozy up to hookers

460
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,333
and I find out,

461
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:35,044
I will make that hypocrisy hurt.

462
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:41,050
Did you get the present I sent you?

463
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:44,971
You wouldn't really call it a present.

464
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:48,349
Well, more of a gentle reminder, maybe.

465
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,811
Mm, more heavy-handed than gentle,

466
00:19:50,813 --> 00:19:52,062
which surprised me.

467
00:19:52,063 --> 00:19:53,856
It's not really your style, Francis.

468
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:57,109
But, yes. I got it.

469
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,612
I like that one.

470
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:00,780
I do too.

471
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:02,156
But the first one's better.

472
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,825
You think?

473
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,701
Something special tomorrow?

474
00:20:05,702 --> 00:20:07,870
Adam Galloway's coming down from New York.

475
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:09,121
What for?

476
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,874
Because I need some of his photographs

477
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,752
for the silent auction
at the gala next month.

478
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,173
You speak to Remy yet?

479
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:20,216
I haven't.

480
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:25,347
If you want to look
inviting, wear the black one.

481
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,979
Hello.

482
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,858
Oh. Okay. Great. Thanks.

483
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,324
Adam?

484
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,793
How is it the world keeps spinning

485
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,503
and you manage to stay ahead of it?

486
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,049
David's on board with this?

487
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,300
It was his idea.

488
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:01,552
Then why isn't he here?

489
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,678
Well, we have to be careful

490
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,762
until it's a done deal.

491
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,014
I don't know, Frank.

492
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,056
Think about it, Terry.

493
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,392
You could become the first

494
00:21:07,393 --> 00:21:08,935
African-American majority leader

495
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,478
in the United States congress.

496
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,231
Let's make some history.

497
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,401
You don't care about history.

498
00:21:16,402 --> 00:21:18,862
You just wanted me because
I can round up the votes.

499
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,531
I need the votes, and
I do care about history,

500
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:22,991
but most importantly, Terry,

501
00:21:22,992 --> 00:21:24,910
you know how to lead.

502
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,329
You're the head of the
black caucus for a reason.

503
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,958
So David becomes speaker,
I become majority leader...

504
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,543
and I stay on as whip.

505
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,212
Why don't you want majority
leader for yourself?

506
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:36,923
I'm satisfied where I am.

507
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,465
Maybe one day, when you become speaker,

508
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,342
you'll bump me up.

509
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:42,504
This is the sort of thing
that there's no turning back.

510
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:45,682
I can throw a cherry on top.

511
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:49,061
McCudden stays open.

512
00:21:50,604 --> 00:21:51,646
How?

513
00:21:51,647 --> 00:21:53,398
You don't want to know how.

514
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,733
You just want the headline

515
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:57,069
when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.

516
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,783
- 12 votes?
- 12 votes.

517
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:04,660
I can get you 10, probably 11.

518
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:07,246
It's so refreshing to work with someone

519
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:09,040
who will throw a saddle on a gift horse

520
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,750
rather than look it in the mouth.

521
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:21,260
That's nice.

522
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,977
Wow.

523
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:31,354
I found her in a village outside Amravati.

524
00:22:31,355 --> 00:22:32,940
Her name was Tiala.

525
00:22:32,941 --> 00:22:35,191
She died three weeks
after I took that picture.

526
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:36,735
Oh, that's awful.

527
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,904
You can have them all if you like.

528
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:42,366
I love your hair short.

529
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:47,288
Do you have plans tonight?

530
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:50,917
No.

531
00:22:50,918 --> 00:22:53,336
Is Frank expecting you home?

532
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,463
I'm sure he'll be home late.

533
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:57,507
Get dinner with me.

534
00:22:58,676 --> 00:22:59,927
What time is your train?

535
00:22:59,928 --> 00:23:02,262
I don't book round-trip tickets.

536
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,392
It's going to be a
while before I can leave.

537
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:08,936
What time will you be done?

538
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,398
Probably around 8:00.

539
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:16,777
I'll pick a place,

540
00:23:16,778 --> 00:23:18,403
let you know.

541
00:23:31,334 --> 00:23:32,794
Ah. David.

542
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:34,921
How are you, Joe?

543
00:23:34,922 --> 00:23:38,008
I'm behind you. Let's do this.

544
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,093
Do what?

545
00:23:40,554 --> 00:23:42,220
Keep your cards close.

546
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,764
I like that.

547
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:30,146
Hi. Yeah. This is room 1214.

548
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:34,609
I'd like a bottle of the Weinbach, please.

549
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,531
Yeah. Actually, could
you make that two bottles?

550
00:24:40,449 --> 00:24:42,118
Thank you.

551
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,078
Sit down. You're making me nervous.

552
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,712
- You still smoke?
- From time to time, yes.

553
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:59,343
I quit. These are an illusion.

554
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:02,013
You want?

555
00:25:02,014 --> 00:25:03,389
Sure.

556
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:07,165
What?

557
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,710
Not now.

558
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:11,920
Okay.

559
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:14,006
I should go.

560
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:16,967
- I just... it seemed...
- I know.

561
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:20,304
We can't start this again.

562
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:23,140
When I end something, I end it.

563
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:27,102
So why'd you have me come all
the way down from New York?

564
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,189
It was a mistake.

565
00:26:30,774 --> 00:26:32,275
I'm sorry, Adam.

566
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,110
I should've kept it business.

567
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,906
Side of you I like the least.

568
00:26:50,002 --> 00:26:52,380
There are no mistakes, Claire.

569
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:11,691
- Hi.
- Hello.

570
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:14,361
- More wine?
- Mm-hmm.

571
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,116
How was your day?

572
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:22,994
- Good.
- Adam well?

573
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:24,996
He is.

574
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,750
We just had dinner.

575
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,460
Hmm.

576
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:34,006
I e-mailed Remy on the way home.

577
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:36,175
I told him I'm not taking the money.

578
00:27:41,222 --> 00:27:42,807
Thank you.

579
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,935
I appreciate that this was not easy.

580
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:47,229
Well, we don't like easy, do we?

581
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,649
Oh, the evidence would suggest it.

582
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,777
Is it all right if the Holburns
come over for dinner Wednesday night?

583
00:27:53,778 --> 00:27:56,322
I want Felicity to buy
some tables for the gala.

584
00:27:56,323 --> 00:27:58,782
Yeah, of course.

585
00:27:58,783 --> 00:28:01,118
I'm going to need congressmen
and senators there.

586
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,537
- You need to call in favors.
- Done.

587
00:28:03,538 --> 00:28:05,123
Not a few, a lot.

588
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,499
I'll start making calls in the morning.

589
00:28:08,793 --> 00:28:11,087
Adam donated ten photographs.

590
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:13,214
That was generous of him.

591
00:28:16,634 --> 00:28:19,262
He's staying at the mandarin.

592
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:23,184
And you?

593
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,269
Here.

594
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:35,029
But the proving grounds' importance

595
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,990
stems far beyond it's
strategic geographic value.

596
00:28:37,991 --> 00:28:41,994
A.P.G.'s research and
development of military materiel

597
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:45,581
is central to our nation's
counter-terrorism efforts.

598
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:47,709
The base houses research laboratories

599
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,294
for preventative medicine

600
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,796
as well as a wide variety
of training grounds

601
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:53,631
for military personnel.

602
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:56,592
A.P.G. is also a job creator.

603
00:28:56,593 --> 00:29:00,722
It provides 400 million
dollars in payroll annually,

604
00:29:00,724 --> 00:29:03,767
and nearly half a billion
dollars in contracts.

605
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:06,854
Thank you for the opportunity
to testify before you today.

606
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:10,274
Any questions for the
congresswoman from Maryland?

607
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:12,193
No.

608
00:29:12,194 --> 00:29:15,530
Those in favor of removing
the aberdeen proving ground

609
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,532
from the list of closures?

610
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:19,034
Aye.

611
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:20,827
So noted and removed.

612
00:29:22,038 --> 00:29:24,081
Okay, we'll next consider

613
00:29:24,082 --> 00:29:26,166
the Philadelphia naval shipyard.

614
00:29:26,167 --> 00:29:29,044
Would the congressman from
Pennsylvania's first district

615
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:31,171
like to offer testimony?

616
00:29:39,306 --> 00:29:41,474
I have no testimony to offer.

617
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,483
Yeah, but the difference
that we're gonna make...

618
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:53,027
Uh, Terry, let me call you right back.

619
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,820
Terry Womack?

620
00:29:54,822 --> 00:29:56,698
Possibly.

621
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,742
I've had three members of
the Black Caucus tell me

622
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,953
they're backing my play
for the speakership.

623
00:30:00,954 --> 00:30:02,580
- Interesting.
- I have a sense

624
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,957
you've been disseminating
some misinformation.

625
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,376
No. I'm afraid it's you
who are misinformed, David.

626
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:10,170
You don't have three members
backing you. You have ten.

627
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:13,424
I made it very clear I
didn't want any part of this.

628
00:30:13,426 --> 00:30:14,968
Yes, you made it crystal clear.

629
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,553
Then why are you telling people?

630
00:30:16,554 --> 00:30:18,846
Because they don't know
you made it crystal clear.

631
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,265
I have to go to Bob with this.

632
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,476
He'll think you organized a coup,

633
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:26,271
got cold feet, and are
making me the scapegoat.

634
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:28,523
David, if I pick up this phone right now

635
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:30,525
and leak this story,

636
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:32,735
Bob will have no choice but to drop you,

637
00:30:32,737 --> 00:30:36,282
even if he believes your version of events.

638
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,370
You wanna take a seat?

639
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:46,917
- Uh, Freddy?
- Yeah, Frank?

640
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:50,004
You better make it a half order.
I got a big dinner tonight.

641
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,547
Sure thing.

642
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,467
Slaw?

643
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:56,178
- Always.
- You got it.

644
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,808
Here you go.

645
00:31:02,684 --> 00:31:04,102
- Oh...
- Ohh!

646
00:31:04,103 --> 00:31:05,646
So, what's the latest?

647
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,314
Oh, you know, Frank. Same old shit.

648
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,732
Almost got killed last weekend.

649
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,485
- Here?
- No.

650
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:13,196
State fair down in Virginia.

651
00:31:13,197 --> 00:31:15,865
Me and my brother hauling
this smoker down there,

652
00:31:15,866 --> 00:31:19,035
and this fucking minivan
had a fridge strapped on top.

653
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:22,163
A fridge strapped on
top of a minivan, Frank.

654
00:31:22,164 --> 00:31:23,706
That's stupid.

655
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,291
Well, that fridge slipped loose.

656
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:27,293
Boom! Right in front of us.

657
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:29,337
I had to swerve to the
left. Barely missed it.

658
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,507
But now that smoker is fishtailing,

659
00:31:31,508 --> 00:31:33,551
almost hit a hatchback in the next lane.

660
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,719
Swerved to the right.
Barely missed that too.

661
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,638
- Jesus.
- Oh, man, it was real.

662
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:39,931
But, you know, that's
why God gave us reflexes.

663
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:43,143
So we can move the fuck
out of the way when a fridge

664
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:45,229
come out of nowhere.

665
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,065
- How them ribs?
- You know how they are.

666
00:31:48,067 --> 00:31:51,653
- You know I like to hear it.
- Perfection, Freddy.

667
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:53,655
Perfection.

668
00:31:53,656 --> 00:31:56,282
- You go on ahead, Frank.
- Thank you, Freddy.

669
00:31:56,283 --> 00:31:57,701
Mm-hmm.

670
00:31:57,702 --> 00:31:59,411
Well, this is a surprise.

671
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:01,746
- You usually text.
- Where are you?

672
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,373
On the other side of the tracks

673
00:32:03,374 --> 00:32:05,375
trying to find the meaning of life.

674
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,001
Did you find anything for me?

675
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:08,671
You mean anything newsworthy?

676
00:32:08,672 --> 00:32:11,716
Uh, I actually didn't call to badger you.

677
00:32:11,717 --> 00:32:13,634
Yes, you did, but that's
part of your charm.

678
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:15,177
No.

679
00:32:15,178 --> 00:32:19,223
I wanted to tell you
that I've been promoted

680
00:32:19,224 --> 00:32:21,392
to White House correspondent.

681
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:29,359
I'll have to travel with the
press corps, be at briefings,

682
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,237
but I can work around all that.

683
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:34,573
If you need me. It won't change anything.

684
00:32:34,574 --> 00:32:36,241
Oh, on the contrary.

685
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:37,784
This changes everything.

686
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:39,327
No. I can be flexible.

687
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:41,747
I'm not interested in
someone who's flexible,

688
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:43,707
I'm interested in someone who's available.

689
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,250
So you think I should turn it down?

690
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:46,961
That's entirely up to you.

691
00:32:46,962 --> 00:32:49,505
Well, I mean, it's not official yet.

692
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:51,633
- I could...
- Oh, look, I've got to go,

693
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:54,843
but call me, you know, if you
find yourself available again.

694
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:03,852
You see, Freddy believes that
if a fridge falls off a minivan,

695
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,564
you better swerve out of its way.

696
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:08,817
I believe it's the fridge's
job to swerve out of mine.

697
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,411
Hey, Janine...

698
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:22,498
Keep walking, Zoe. I really don't
want to talk to you right now.

699
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,375
It's not like I asked him for it.

700
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:26,461
- He just called me into his office, and...
- Oh, please.

701
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,213
You've been gunning for my job
since the day you bounced in here

702
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:30,674
with a lollipop in your mouth.

703
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,924
Congratulations.

704
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:34,010
I'll send you a bottle of champagne

705
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,012
from the Middle West,
wherever the fuck that is.

706
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:39,056
I'm gonna turn it down.
You don't have to leave.

707
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:40,809
Are you trying to rub this in or something?

708
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,269
Please believe me. You
should be in the White House.

709
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,773
I don't want it. I never did.

710
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:49,610
I was hoping we could go see Tom together.

711
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,571
- I want him to know that we both...
- Get the fuck out of my face.

712
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,906
I'm asking. For real. I don't want the job.

713
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,660
Then you're an even bigger
idiot than I thought you were.

714
00:33:57,661 --> 00:33:59,370
Go. Before I get violent.

715
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:21,853
Peter?

716
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,941
- Hello?
- But the Bering Sea

717
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,152
is a violent and unpredictable force.

718
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,572
Hi. Uh, my name is Christina.

719
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,782
- I work with your dad.
- He's not here.

720
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:36,534
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

721
00:34:36,535 --> 00:34:38,411
He said he'd be back in a little while.

722
00:34:38,413 --> 00:34:40,831
Uh, when was that?

723
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:44,626
When he dropped us home from school.

724
00:34:44,627 --> 00:34:46,795
He left his phone here.

725
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:51,675
Are you dad's girlfriend?

726
00:34:51,676 --> 00:34:53,260
No. No. I, uh...

727
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,845
I just... I... I work for your dad.

728
00:34:54,846 --> 00:34:57,055
Then why do you have the
keys to his apartment?

729
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:01,936
Will you make us pop-tarts?

730
00:35:01,937 --> 00:35:05,231
An enormous 60-foot rogue
wave struck the Aleutian...

731
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:07,316
It was just sublime, Claire.

732
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:09,611
- Thank you.
- I don't think I'll eat for a week.

733
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:12,154
Does that mean no room for dessert?

734
00:35:12,155 --> 00:35:14,323
I'd love to, but, uh, none for me.

735
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:16,242
Why don't you and I head downstairs

736
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:18,203
for a little Brandy and some cigars?

737
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:21,415
- Cubans?
- You don't think I smoke anything legal, do you?

738
00:35:23,501 --> 00:35:25,544
- Dessert for you?
- No. No, thanks.

739
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:27,421
But I will take a refill
of this Chardonnay, though.

740
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:30,549
Of course. Oh, this is
almost out. I'll grab another.

741
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:48,610
I hate how they just hit you like that

742
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:50,737
with no warning.

743
00:35:50,738 --> 00:35:52,781
You get night sweats too?

744
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:57,745
I, uh...

745
00:35:57,746 --> 00:36:00,623
This is very new to me.

746
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,708
Does Frank know?

747
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:06,462
I haven't... we haven't... no.

748
00:36:06,463 --> 00:36:09,256
I'm sorry. We don't
have to talk about this.

749
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:13,135
No. It's fine. I'm just, uh...

750
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,931
It's fine. I feel better now.

751
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:18,099
- Could I have a little bit more?
- Sure.

752
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,685
Just say when.

753
00:36:19,686 --> 00:36:22,896
Charles is driving tonight, so...

754
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:25,357
And when.

755
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:28,193
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

756
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:35,451
So, you mentioned, when
you invited me, the C.W.I.

757
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:38,746
You're having a gala
and launching some new...

758
00:36:38,747 --> 00:36:40,331
Yes, that's right.

759
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,291
We just brought on this
brilliant young woman

760
00:36:42,292 --> 00:36:45,003
who's going to help us
expand our efforts overseas.

761
00:36:45,004 --> 00:36:47,046
- Claire, I will save you the trouble.
- So we'll...

762
00:36:47,047 --> 00:36:50,174
Charles and I would be
delighted to contribute.

763
00:36:50,176 --> 00:36:52,386
Well, that's very
generous of you, Felicity.

764
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:55,389
Well, you were such a darling, getting
us tickets to the Jefferson Ball.

765
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,141
- Oh, that was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.

766
00:36:58,142 --> 00:36:59,810
It was...

767
00:36:59,811 --> 00:37:02,437
People in this town
don't go out of their way

768
00:37:02,438 --> 00:37:04,356
to be nice to each other.

769
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:07,776
Fourteen years Charles and
I have been here, and...

770
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:09,945
Anyway, um,

771
00:37:09,947 --> 00:37:12,615
I'm grateful to have a friend.

772
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,786
How much do you need?

773
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:30,259
Christina, what the
fuck are you doing here?

774
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,553
Shh. They're sleeping.

775
00:37:39,643 --> 00:37:41,938
Peter.

776
00:38:31,281 --> 00:38:33,158
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, kiddo.

777
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,160
Would you take your brother downstairs?

778
00:38:35,161 --> 00:38:38,080
- I'll be there in a second.
- Okay. Bye, dad.

779
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:41,291
- Bye.
- Bye? Where they going?

780
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:44,003
I'm taking them to their grandmother's.

781
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,422
I was able to get a hold of
Madeleine, and I told her...

782
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:48,424
Oh, fuck. You didn't tell her?

783
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:52,137
No, I didn't. But I should have.

784
00:38:52,138 --> 00:38:54,305
I told her that you had to travel for work,

785
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:56,975
which is the last time I ever lie for you.

786
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:00,227
Look...

787
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,522
what happened, Peter?

788
00:39:02,524 --> 00:39:05,442
I'm... I'm sorry about the Brack hearing.

789
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,653
- I was...
- Fuck the Brack hearing.

790
00:39:07,654 --> 00:39:09,822
What about your kids?

791
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,826
After I drop them off, I'm done.

792
00:39:13,827 --> 00:39:16,495
I am no longer your girlfriend.
I no longer work for you.

793
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:18,288
No... hey, Christina...

794
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:21,208
I don't want to hear it, Peter.
There's no excuse this time.

795
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,344
- I don't have much time, Frank.
- I'll make it short.

796
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,388
- The President?
- No. The speakership.

797
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:35,015
David's making a play.

798
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:37,433
- What?
- He came to me for support.

799
00:39:37,434 --> 00:39:39,435
My first thought was
to tell you right away,

800
00:39:39,436 --> 00:39:41,730
but then my second thought
was to ignore my first thought,

801
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:44,108
because we have the votes, Bob.

802
00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:46,485
If there had been a party
revolt, I would've known about it.

803
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:49,030
We don't need the whole
party to revolt. We need 13...

804
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:52,075
13 Democrats, plus the
other side of the aisle.

805
00:39:52,076 --> 00:39:53,617
Are you out of your mind?

806
00:39:53,618 --> 00:39:55,578
People have been asking
me that a lot lately.

807
00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:57,205
I'm inclined to start saying yes.

808
00:39:57,206 --> 00:39:59,415
Who are they... the 13?

809
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:01,459
David and I are two, Terry Womack,

810
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,046
and ten members of the
black caucus make another 11.

811
00:40:04,047 --> 00:40:05,797
Is the President behind this?

812
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:07,216
No. He doesn't have a clue.

813
00:40:07,217 --> 00:40:10,052
This was David's plan executed by me.

814
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:12,054
But there is an out for you, Bob.

815
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:14,431
I can sway Womack either way

816
00:40:14,432 --> 00:40:18,351
as long as you make him
the next majority leader.

817
00:40:18,353 --> 00:40:20,354
And...

818
00:40:20,355 --> 00:40:22,815
- The education bill.
- Now we're on the same page.

819
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:24,984
I can't do that. You know I can't.

820
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:28,071
You're the speaker, Bob. You
can do anything you'd like.

821
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:33,367
And I have to say, appointing the first
African-American majority leader...

822
00:40:33,368 --> 00:40:36,537
why, that isn't a bad legacy to have.

823
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,084
I'm sorry. I changed my mind.

824
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:41,752
I thought about it, and...

825
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:44,421
Thinking about it was what
those two days were for.

826
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:46,966
And then I thought about it
some more, and I realized I...

827
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:49,426
Jesus Christ, you're fucking unbelievable.

828
00:40:49,427 --> 00:40:53,097
Look, Tom, I appreciate the fact
that you took a chance on me, but...

829
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:54,431
No, I don't think you do.

830
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:56,976
I don't think you appreciate anything.

831
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:59,729
I think you're an ungrateful,
self-entitled little c...

832
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,689
Little what?

833
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,609
Little what, Tom? Say it.

834
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:07,695
Cunt. You're a cunt.

835
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:14,327
What are you doing?

836
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:16,037
Don't you dare...

837
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:18,415
you don't even know what I'm typing.

838
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,459
- Get out, Zoe.
- Just a second. I'm almost done.

839
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,378
Get out. You're fired.

840
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:26,299
Whatever you have to tell yourself, Tom.

841
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,466
Get out!

842
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,053
So should I press "send"?

843
00:41:31,054 --> 00:41:33,222
I think I should.

844
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,436
Call me whatever you want,

845
00:41:38,437 --> 00:41:40,522
but you should remember, these days,

846
00:41:40,523 --> 00:41:43,859
when you're talking to one person,
you're talking to a thousand.

847
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:02,545
Well, you'll say you
wanted to spend more time

848
00:42:02,546 --> 00:42:04,339
focusing on your home district.

849
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:07,258
You'll say Womack is the
right man to fill your shoes.

850
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:10,386
You won't make waves.
You won't do interviews.

851
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,930
You'll suck it up and be a team player.

852
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,392
This was Frank's idea.

853
00:42:15,393 --> 00:42:17,644
I told you he was gonna
try to blame me on it.

854
00:42:17,645 --> 00:42:19,271
Ask around. Talk to Womack.

855
00:42:19,272 --> 00:42:20,856
I did. He said you came to him.

856
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:23,775
He's fucking lying, Bob! I would never...

857
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:25,236
shut up, David.

858
00:42:25,237 --> 00:42:28,322
Do you understand how you're to behave

859
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:29,948
when we make the announcement?

860
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,742
And if I don't play along?

861
00:42:31,744 --> 00:42:34,829
Then the D-triple-C will
pour everything it's got

862
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,874
into your primary opponent's
campaign next cycle.

863
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,876
We'll cleave you from the herd

864
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,587
and watch you die in the wilderness.

865
00:42:44,256 --> 00:42:46,841
Tell us now, David.

866
00:42:53,766 --> 00:42:56,685
If you think it's best, Robert.

867
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:59,521
And just think, he could have been a wolf.

868
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,683
You made yourself available.

869
00:43:34,684 --> 00:43:36,894
I quit.

870
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:38,771
Fuck that place.

871
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:41,607
It was a prison. I'm free now.

872
00:43:41,608 --> 00:43:43,359
Congratulations.

873
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,819
Where are you?

874
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,862
- In a car.
- So am I.

875
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:48,365
Where you headed?

876
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:51,327
- Home.
- So am I.

877
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,120
To your home or mine?

878
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:54,621
Is that an invitation?

879
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:56,957
It's whatever you want it to be.

880
00:43:56,958 --> 00:43:59,542
- You sound tipsy.
- I am.

881
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:02,838
I just spent the last two hours
drinking Long Island Iced Teas.

882
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:06,968
What's your address?

883
00:45:12,995 --> 00:45:15,164
Do your parents know you live like this?

884
00:45:16,082 --> 00:45:19,001
No. They haven't visited.

885
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:21,795
Are you cared for?

886
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:23,631
How do you mean?

887
00:45:23,632 --> 00:45:27,386
Do you have a man who cares for you?

888
00:45:27,387 --> 00:45:30,138
- An older man.
- No.

889
00:45:31,348 --> 00:45:33,934
But you've been with older men before?

890
00:45:34,893 --> 00:45:35,936
Yes.

891
00:45:35,937 --> 00:45:38,355
Then you know they hurt you,

892
00:45:38,356 --> 00:45:40,690
and after they hurt you,

893
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:43,236
they discard you.

894
00:45:44,404 --> 00:45:46,531
You can't hurt me.

895
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,535
Take your heels off.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
