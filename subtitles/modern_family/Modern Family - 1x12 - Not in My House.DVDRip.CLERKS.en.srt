Beautiful morning, isn't it?

It's a shame you
have to work, huh? Yeah.

3
00:00:07,466 --> 00:00:09,718
Anyway, I'd like a large
sausage and pepperoni-

00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,970
It's my stuff, okay?

5
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:13,763
Just keep your hands
off my stuff!
Hey!

6
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:16,057
I didn't put my hands
on your stuff.

00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:19,311
Hey! Just a second, Derek.
What is the problem?

8
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:21,563
Alex read my journal.
I did not!

9
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:24,024
Why would I even want to
read your stupid journal?

10
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:27,652
Because it contains
the details of a life,
and you don't have one!

11
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,113
Oh!
Alex, don't read
Haley's journal.

Sorry. My daughters.

Oh. What grade are you in?

Oh, that's my wife, Claire.

16
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:42,042
Luke was using my computer for this.

17
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,711
I'm gonna have to,
uh, call you back.

18
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,006
He told me he needed it to do homework,
and then I find this, a-a picture...

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,969
of a topless woman,
with the biggest boobs I have
ever seen, driving a tractor.

20
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:59,309
Okay. Um- Uh, first of all,
that's a combine, not a tractor.
Phil!

21
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,937
Phil! It is smut,
and our 10-year-old
is looking at smut!

22
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:05,148
It's disgusting!
Completely unacceptable.

00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,484

That was my picture.

00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,945
Well, not really mine.
There's this guy at work
who sends out these links.

Doesn't matter who.
Gil Thorpe.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,617
He sent out another one
of the same woman dressed
as a battleship.

00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,619
You know, the-

And then one of the Transformers-
And then it-

29
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:24,417
Anyway, I had every intention
of telling Claire.

30
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:27,254
I just wanted her
to calm down first.

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,048
Where are you going?
I'm going to pick up Luke
from his sleepover.

32
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,259
We need to talk to him
about this now.

33
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:34,719
Claire, this is a very
delicate situation.
Mm-hmm.

34
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:38,306
If we don't handle it right,
Luke might end up having an
unhealthy attitude about sex...

35
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,308

Okay, fine.

38

But I am telling him
that every time he looks
at porn, God kills a puppy.

00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,528
Maybe I should be the one
to talk to him.

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,890
Okay, forgive me for trying
to make our home beautiful.

149
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,143
You know, if I can put up
with those, you can put up
with a piece of art.

150
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,773
This is not art.
This is an unholy mix
between man and beast.

151
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:06,944
But, fine, if you love it so much,
put it wherever you want.

152
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,364
Thank you. Where you going?
To get some more pillows?

153
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,702
No, don't worry.
It'll be a long time before
I bother you again with my pillows.

Why is Dad in Luke's room
with the door closed?

155
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,086
They are having
a little talk.
Is Luke being punished?

156
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,130
Is that just your favorite thing,
when your brother or sister
gets into trouble?

157
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:28,800
My favorite is when
they're both in trouble.

158
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,511
So, what'd he do?
Did he cheat on a test?
He's a cheater.

159
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,262
He did not cheat on a test.

160
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,431
Did he lie?
He lies all the time.
Alex.

161
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,519
Alex.
Sorry. I'm just
worried about Luke.

I appreciate your concern,

- Mmm. How'd it go?

Well, he was really embarrassed,
but everything's-
everything's fine now.

173
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,389
What'd you say?
Well, you know,

174
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:19,726
- I kinda promised him we'd
keep everything between us.
- Mm-hmm.

175
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,438
Matter of fact, he'd be
mortified if you brought
it up with him... ever.

- Oh, God, really?
- Yeah.

That actually makes me
feel kinda bad.

Well, you're probably just
feeling a little tense
from all this.

I know I am.

You know what might
help the situation?

Where's your mind?

Something "house"
something.

Come on. Move this thing along!

Okay, this man is in crisis.

He could have a family health issue
or a personal health issue
or a financial matter.

Stop. You're getting all this from
"something house something"?

you always do this.

It's like you're
incapable of hearing
anyone's sad story...

without making it
your job to fix it.

to do with the gardener.

- Okay, let's go.
- No, please.

I know it's killing you
not to get back there
in the middle of that.

Oh, no, no, no, no. We are
going. These folks can find
their own way out.

- It's a puppet show, Mitch.

always add the word "gay"
where it doesn't belong?

different from us,

have been looking at?

290
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,651
Yeah. It was just so freaky.

291
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,112
I couldn't stop looking.
I know, sweet pea.

292
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:49,657
But the important thing is
you did stop looking.
Yeah.

293
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,784
After about an hour.

294
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:56,539
Okay. Well,
it's perfectly normal to be
curious about these things.

295
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,582
Some parts were funny.
Mm-hmm.

296
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,127
And some parts
just seemed crazy.

297
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,588
Well, I hope you realize
that some of those parts
weren't real.

298
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,340
Obviously.
[Chuckles]

299
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,926
But they can be
totally real, right?
Hmm.

300
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,554
Like Anne Frank's?
What?

301
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,514
All I know is it really
made me wonder about Haley.

302
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,309
That's disturbing, sweetie.
Why Haley?
[Footsteps Approaching]

303
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:19,061
It was her journal.

304
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,938
You read my journal?
You little creep!

305
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,731
I'm sorry!
I couldn't help it.

306
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,441
Wait. Haley's journal too?

307
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,861
Luke, you are now banned
from the computer.
What?

308
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,571
What happened?
Who's in trouble?

309
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,282
- Luke read my journal!
- I told you it wasn't me!

310
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,576
- You know, I'm gonna kill you.
- Haley, calm down.

311
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,995
Wait, you're not even gonna
yell at him? That was private.

312
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,372
Oh, please.
The most shocking thing
in there was your spelling.

313
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,957
You read it too?

314
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,792
Am I the only one
who hasn't read it?

315
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:44,795
I was looking through
the computers in the house
for pornography.

316
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,507
- Sick.
- Not for me. I wanted to see
what you guys are looking at.

317
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,342
So you're violating our privacy.

318
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,094
When I find out that my children...

319
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:55,431
are looking
at a naked picture online,
they don't have any privacy.

320
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,267
- Who was looking
at naked pictures?
- That doesn't matter.

321
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,060
I wasn't.

322
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,980
Wasn't me.
That's gross. I'm 10!

323
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,773
Wait a minute.
What's wrong
with you people?

324
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,650
If it wasn't you,
who was it?
[Door Opens]

325
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,320
Mangia!

326
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,158
Rosa, thank you
for coming.
Gracias.

327
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,453
Carlos, let me know how it
works out with that dentist.
Victor, you owe me a dance.

328
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,455
[Cameron]
Yes, I'm a caring person.

329
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,708
And without Mitchell,
I would just keep giving
and giving and giving.

330
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:28,255
I'm like a big runaway charity truck
and Mitchell is my off-ramp
full of safety gravel.

331
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,218
He knows how to say no.
He always can put himself first.

332
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:36,513
He certainly can turn his back
on someone suffering. Um-

333
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,976
No, really. Keep going.

334
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,272
- He-
- Don't keep going!

335
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:48,108
Muchas gracias.
Hey, good-bye.

336
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,986
- That was nice.
- [Knocking]

337
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,783
- Oh, God. Dad.
- Looks like I missed
the party, huh?

338
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,493
What is-
What is that doing here?

339
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:00,829
He is a gift
for you and Cam.
Thank you.

340
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,166
He lost his monocle on the drive.
Head was out the window.

341
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,461
Well, they love that.
Let's put him here for now.

342
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,296
- [Mitchell]
I don't want that.
- I think he's cute.

343
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,007
Let's give him a chance.
I came as soon
as I heard your message.

344
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:14,009
You said that somebody
was getting married?

345
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,513
Gloria, there you are.
I've got good news.

346
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,186
What's the matter?

347
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,984
Honey? Hey.

348
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,194
I'm really sorry.

349
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,780
That picture
was just something
that someone sent me.

350
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,284
Doesn't matter who.
Gil Thorpe.

351
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,912
Anyway,
I don't do that stuff.

352
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,123
You're all the porn I need.
That's-
Uh-

353
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,125
Honey, it's fine.

354
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,836
It's fine. Mmm.

355
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,256
Now, it's fine.

356
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,592
[Claire]
I couldn't care less
about the picture.

357
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,971
I was just upset
when I thought it was Luke.

358
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,182
Haley, honey,
I really wish you would give me
a hand with all this laundry.

359
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,184
You never, ever-

360
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,645
[Claire]
Haley's off in her own world.

361
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,315
Alex has never
really been a kid.

362
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,067
But Luke is my baby.

363
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:17,323
Is it really too much
to ask that he stay
a sweet, innocent kid...

364
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,408
forever?

365
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,369
[Door Opens, Closes]

366
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,458
Hey, buddy.
Um- Here. Sorry.

367
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,460
We'II dribble later.

368
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:33,339
Um, I just, uh-
I just want to say I'm sorry.

369
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,800
I never meant to blame you
for that whole picture thing.

370
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:41,764
Your mom sort of thought it
was yours and I should have
stopped it, but I didn't.

371
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,724
So what was the picture of?

372
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:49,730
Well, it was
a woman on a tractor
and she had her shirt off.

373
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,775
Was it hot?

374
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,902
Okay, we're being
honest here.

375
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,655
Um, this particular woman-

376
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,200
Well, my tastes
do run to the curvy,

377
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,744
and the cowboy hat
did not hurt one bit.

378
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,206
Couple that with the cutoff jeans-
And you were asking about
the weather, weren't you?

379
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,625
Yeah.

380
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,088
Well, this is good.
This is good.

381
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,548
You're gonna be going
through some changes soon.

382
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,010
And I think now you can
feel safe talking to me
about whatever.

383
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,648
[Cameron]
And so it ends.

384
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:38,404
Sadly, I've been summarily
dismissed from the employ of
Masters Cameron and Mitchell.

385
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,572
The former being
an utter delight,

386
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,783
and the latter
being a humorless snoot.

387
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,035
Just come on.
Get him in the car.
The thrift shop's closing.

388
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,496
What is this exciting thrift
shop you speak of?

389
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,332
Many of my relatives were
taken out of their homes...

390
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,043
to be released into the green
pastures in their maturity-

391
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,963
Did you just say "matoority?"
Unhand me, you brute!

392
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,965
I regret nothing!

393
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,175
I'll pay you.
I'm a comfortable man.

394
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,386
I've been stealing from
your father for days.

395
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,141
Oh, is there any better feeling
in the world than having
your ears flap in the wind?

396
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:09,643
You know what?
Get out.
You mean it? Sweet freedom?

397
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,146
No, not you, Barkley.
Cameron, out.
Oh.

398
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:17,901
