and getting a "B."

in the middle of the night.

of a perfectionist.

a job interview.

00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,185
Oh, man.

00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,315
Nothing.
Yeah, right.
What about the pigeons?

00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,484
Oh, I don't like them.
They're shifty.

Oh!

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,035
Never getting
my driver's license.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:37,454
Or getting one
and the picture sucks.

14
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,373
Dying alone.

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,001
Oh, Haley, sweetie,
did you find your shoes?

16
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,795
Mom, please, not today.
I just wanted to know
if you found your shoes.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,632
Why are you hounding me?
I'm freaking out right now.

18
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:51,218
You need to relax.
It's just a driver's test.

19
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:54,596
It's my third driver's test,
and if I fail again,

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,640
I have to wait six months
to retake it.

21
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,476
That's six more months of you
driving me everywhere.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,020
Then I'm, like, "There's no way
I'm wearing that." And she was, like-

23
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,189
Like.
"Well, if you don't wear it,
then you can't play."

24
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,274
And then I was, like,
"That's fine by me."
Honey, like.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,610
And then she was, like,
"Well, if you don't play-"
Like! Like!

26
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,362
Mom! Stop!
Stop saying "like"
all the time.

27

You're embarrassing me! Stop it!
Like, like, like, like, aah!

00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,366
Hmm.

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,701
Haley. Found your jacket.

00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:20,538
Why is everyone on me?
God!

31
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,166
Ignore her. She can't focus
on two things at once.

00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,752
Always a good quality
in a driver.

Sweetie, we need
to get you some shoes
for the dance tonight.

00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:31,091
No, we don't.
I'm not going.
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,051
Why would you
not be going to the dance?

36
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,886
[Exhales] Because
school dances are lame.

37
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:38,890
A bunch of immature boys
trying to impress you
with how cool they are...

Wow.

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,112
A few days ago, the cable guy
was under the house.

44
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,447
When he was leaving,
he said to Haley,

"Wow. That's quite a collection
you've got down there."

Here's the thing. We have no idea
what he's talking about.

47
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,917
All week, Luke and I have been
getting more and more excited
about what it could be.

48
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:08,795
I bet it's really cool
old magazines.

49
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,674
Yeah. Or a bunch
of necklaces made
out of animal teeth.

50
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,884
Or bugs frozen
in amber.

51
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:18,930
What if it's really
expensive bottles of wine?
Or a suit of armor.

[Video Game Sounds]
What if there's ancient
Indian arrowheads under there?

What if it's gold bars?
Oh, you think?

54

For God sakes, why don't you

Hey, Cam.
Cam, where did we
get this dolly from?

59
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,714
From Janice and Olivia.
They brought it over yesterday.
Lily loves it.

60
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,925
Seems a little frilly,
you know, coming from them.

61
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:59,179
What, because they're lesbians?
That's sort of an offense stereotype,
don't you think?

62
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,766
Yeah, I suppose. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, did they
bring back our coffee maker?

63
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,976
No. It was too big.
They were on their motorcycle.

64
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,647
We got off to an awkward start

[Chuckles]
I'm sorry. Uh, bold?

She said no patient

Yeah. Subtext,
"This is weird."

I didn't hear any subtext.

[Exhales]
I don't even know
why we're doing this.

The patient she likes,
that's who.

Well, maybe if you
bake her a cake,
she'll give us free X-rays.

It's all about making connections.

Why do you think the dentist
gives me all that free stuff?

Ay, papi, but you're not warm.

Uh, probably because
you were cooking
and your hands are warm.

of roller coasters.
Poor kid.

I don't know where
he gets his fear from...

95
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,854
because his father's
not afraid of anything.

No bulls, no heights,
no helicopters,
no fast cars-

But go to dinner with him
and wait for the check to come.

00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:06,426
How about we take him
to the pier and go
fishing, huh? Manny!

151
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,553
He likes to fish?
Yeah.

152
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:13,725
He comes from a long line
of fishermen and smugglers.
But I encourage the fishing.

153
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,394
- Manny, you like to fish?
- Fishing? Yeah.

154
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,438
You want to go
to the pier today?

155
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:22,275
Is this a trick to see
if I'm really sick?
No.

156
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,028
Maybe the fresh air
will make you feel better.

157
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,364
Well, then yeah,
'cause there's no place
where I'm more at one with-

158
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,782
Just get your coat.

159
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,826
Are you nervous?
Shut up, Alex.

160
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,329
I was just asking.
I'd be nervous
if I were you.

161
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,456
Alex, leave your sister alone.
She's gonna be fine.

162
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,833
As long as I don't
get the same guy.
He's so mean.

163
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,376
You probably will.
You won't.

164
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,587
He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.

165
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:45,006
He yelled at me.
You drove into the bushes.

166
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,925
Oh, no. It's him.
Please don't be for me.
Please don't be for me.

167
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,386
Please don't be for me.
Please don't be me. Hi.

168
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,223
Oh, thank God.

169
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,935
Well, come on.
I don't have all day.

170
00:07:58,062 --> 00:08:01,230
I'm gonna throw up.
Okay, no. This is
what you're gonna do.

171
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,399
You're gonna get in that car,
put on your seat belt...

172
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,693
and take three deep breaths
and relax.

173
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:07,945
This guy sees
hundreds of kids every day.

174
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,073
He probably doesn't even
remember you, all right?
Okay.

175
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,825
Yo. Let's move it,
two strikes.

176
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,244
[Sighs]

177
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:18,039
[Breathing Heavily]
That's more
than three breaths, honey.

178
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,752
See how much better this is?

179
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,754
The truck goes in.
It gets video.

180
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,507
And then we get a preview
of whatever's in there.
How ingenious is that, huh?

181
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,134
Are you just scared to go in?

182
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,178
Why would you say that?

183
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,764
Well, when you
stuck your head in,
you screamed a little.

184
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,766
I told you.
That was the house settling.

185
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,603
Besides, this is so much cooler.
This is how NASA does it.

186
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,481
Now, hand me
the ltty Bitty Book Light.

187
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:47,443
Yeah. Final piece of the puzzle.

188
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:51,489
[Lmitates Explosion]
Blast off.

189

[Motor Whirring]

190
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,704
Hey, Dad?
Yeah?

191
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,415
How are you supposed to steer
if you don't know where you're going?

192
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,168
Stay in the present, buddy.
Gotta do it by feel.

193
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,337
Gotta get all Jedi on it.

194
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,599
- [Motor Grinding]
- Uh-oh.

195
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,435
- Did you just lose my truck?
- No.

196
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,186
You just lost my truck!
No, I didn't!

197
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,230
That was my truck!
Grandpa just gave it to me!

198
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,983
- I told you to stay in the present!
- Stop yelling!

199
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,114
- Truce?
- Yeah. Sorry.

200
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,161
This is delicious.

201
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:41,748
Oh. Thank you. The recipe's from
the now-defunct Gourmet magazine.

202
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,751
Why do all the things
I love go away?

203
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:49,046
Look, I don't even think
she said the "M" word.

204
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:53,342
No, we heard it. It was
clear as day. I- I just don't know
what we've done wrong.

205
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:56,554
I quit my job so I could
stay at home with her.

206
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,264
[Tearfully]
But maybe it's not enough.

207
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:03,394
Maybe we're not providing her
with the feminine energy
that she needs.

208
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:08,900
- [Sobs]
- Yeah, I wouldn't be
too concerned about that.

209
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,152
You- You know it's
because you're Asian, right?

210
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,196
Cam.
No, I'm sorry. What?

211
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,074
Am I just supposed to ignore
the giant panda in the room?

212
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,952
Pandas are from China.
I- Well, it doesn't matter.

213
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,582
Okay, okay. I think
what my hysterical partner
is just trying to say, if I may,

214
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,584
that for the first
six months of her life,

215
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:30,880
Lily was raised by very
loving Asian women,
in an orphanage,

216
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,965
with whom
she clearly bonded.

217
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,844
And then suddenly you come in
with all of your Asian-ness...

218
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:40,348
and-and-and breasts
and womb, lady bits-

219
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:43,559
and it all just comes
rushing back to her, and I-

220
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,854
You guys are overreacting.

221
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,441
I'm sure Lily just strung
a couple of random
syllables together,

222
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,152
and they happen
to sound something
like that word.

223
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,239
But that's all.
[Laughs]

224
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,284
- Do you really think that?
- Of course.

225
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,119
- She's right.
- We're being ridiculous.

226

- We're being ridiculous.
- Your daddies are being ridiculous.

Okay. Well-
[Silverware Clattering]

- Okay. No, no, no.

She's made her choice.

00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,344
All right, left turn.
Here?

232
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,930
At the intersection, yeah.
Okay.

233
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,224
[Turn Signal Clicking]
Left.

234
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,977
What?
I said left.
You're going right.

235
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,938
Wait. No, wait.
I'm trying, okay?
Pull over.

00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,774
- No, I can do this!
- Pull over now.

- Why are you crying?
- Why do you hate me?

00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:40,283
Oh, hell.
Haley, I don't hate you.

239
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,411
You seem like a nice girl.
You remind me of my daughter.

to live a long and happy life...

and not hurt my daughter.

- No, sir.

- No, sir.

All right. Let's start this
from the beginning.

247
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,019
Could you smile first?

248
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,187
I'll be less nervous
if you smile.

[Sniffles]

250
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,778
Okay, that didn't help.

251
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,363
Just go.

a good day for halibut.

Hey, Jay, did I ever
tell you about the time...

255
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:31,876
I used peanut butter
and jelly for bait and
I caught a thresher shark?

I don't know.
You tell me a lot
of funny things.

Why are we going this way?

258
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:38,466
It's just another way to go.

259
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,134
Uh-oh.
Something's going on.

260

What are you
talking about?
Wake up, old man.

on that roller coaster.

to face your fears.

That's why we're here?
Why didn't you let me
in on your little plan?

267
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,236
Because you're the worst liar.
He would have seen
right through you.

268
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,280
I don't wanna go
on the roller coaster.

269
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,074
Manny, you were afraid
to light the barbecue,

270
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,952
but now your eyebrows
have grown back...

271
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,120
and your salmon is legendary.

272
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,623
What if I fall out?
I will catch you.

273
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,334
That's not possible.
He would crush you.

274
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,919
What if I throw up?

275
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,004
I will clean it up.
It wouldn't be the first time.

276
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:19,465
Geez, these are new shoes.

277
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,092
You're not gonna let up,
are you?

278
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,260
Baby, I think
you know the answer.

[Laughs]
That's my boy.
Vamos, Jay.

281
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,229
No, I'm not going on that.
That's bad for my back.

282
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:36,190
Your back is fine.
I got an inner-ear thing.

283
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,276
Oh, please.
Don't tell me you're scared too.
Scared?

284
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,320
What is this "scared" stuff?

285
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,072
What am I, a child?
I'm not scared.

286
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,782
You see?
You're the worst liar.

Well, if he's not going,
I'm not going.

288

Oh, for God's sake, fine!
I'll go alone.

289

Here. Take my girlie purse
and you my floppy hat,

290

and if you need it,
there's the ladies' room.

291
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,216
I'm not man enough
to fight this.

292
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:06,262
Here. Hold my purse.

293
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:11,017
Oh, hell!

294
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:18,441
What's taking them
so long?
I don't know.

295
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:22,403
The only reason I'm not panicking
is I haven't seen a giant geyser.

296
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,156
You know, honey, I think I know
why you don't wanna go tonight.
