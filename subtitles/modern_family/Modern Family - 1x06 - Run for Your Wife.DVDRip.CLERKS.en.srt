149
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,886
[Chuckles]
Jay's very spontaneous.

150
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:12,890
He's always surprising me
with little presents,
fun getaways.

151
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:17,186
I wasn't the greatest husband
the first time around, but I'm
trying to do better this time.

152
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,273
And maybe
by my third marriage,
I'll have it down pat.

153
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,525
[Chuckles]

154
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,028
Yeah, that one's
gonna cost me.

155
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,118
What ya reading there?
A book?

156
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,287
Yeah. I've been meaning
to get to it for a while.

157
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,998
Ooh, it's got a map
at the beginning.
I like it when books do that.

158
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:39,667
Mm-hmm.

159
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,795
Don't you have an open house
this morning?
I rescheduled.

160
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,881
Thought you might
like some company.

161
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,091
[Grunts]

162
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:50,345
Well, the first day of school
can be tough for stay-at-home moms.

163
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:53,556
Now, you have to understand,
the kids are gone,
the nest is empty.

164
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:56,142
They are rudderless.

165
00:07:56,226 --> 00:08:01,481
And a lot of guys
wouldn't even notice,
but I'm not a lot of guys.

166
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,483
I listen with my mind,

167
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,486
and if you pay attention,
women will tell you
what they want...

168
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,489
by telling you
the opposite of what they want.

169
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,492
The other day, Claire was, like,
"You have to move your car.

170
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,495
There's no space in the garage
for both of our cars."

171
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,415
And what she's really saying is
that, you know, I should
probably get a sports car.

172
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:23,544
I was sort of looking forward
to a quiet day.

173
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,256
Thought I'd just read,
maybe go for a run later,
that's it.

174
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,050
Great.
We'll run together.

175
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,803
You don't have to
do that.

176
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,222
I know.

177
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:40,019
Listening.

178
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,730
The thing is,
I like to run alone.

179
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:44,816
And I run kinda fast,
so-

180
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,152
So?
So I'm not sure you're gonna
be able to keep up with me.

181
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:50,405
[Laughing]

182
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,448
You're kid-
You're kidding, right?

183
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,659
No.
You really think
I can't keep up with you?

184
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,953
I'm not sure you can keep up
with this conversation.

185
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,955
I think you're forgetting that
I power-walk every morning...

186
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,165
and that I wear my special shoes
with the big soles,

187
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,167
which were designed
by a doctor.

188
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,714
Yes, I know.
But I run every day.

189
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,341
You really think
you can run as fast as me?

190
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:16,264
No, Phil, I think I can
run much, much faster...
than you.

191
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,068
Boom. Just like that,
the whole day changed.

192
00:09:29,153 --> 00:09:32,947
It was game on.
She knew it. I knew it.
We both knew it.

193
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,159
[Sighs]
I just wanna read.

194
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,120
I think I'II order
what I had the last time.
What was that called?

195
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,206
You want me to say it because
you want me to roll my R's.
Come on!

196
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,667
Reuben.
[Giggles]
[Chuckling]

197
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,131
- Jay, what is this?
- Oh, looks like my old car cover.

198
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,176
Don't give me that.
This is Manny's poncho.
What is it doing here?

199
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,054
- Maybe he decided to take
it off on the way to school.
- What did you say to him?

200
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,806
Nothing.
I... told some jokes.

201
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,184
You say plenty with your jokes.

202
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,479
Jay, he looks up to you.
He respects your opinion.

203
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,607
We dodged a bullet on this.
Trust me. I've been
down this road before.

204
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,903
I remember one time
Mitchell decided to wear
a jaunty scarf to school.

205
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:15,740
I kept my mouth shut.
He got his jaunty butt kicked.

206
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:20,119
My dad has this perception that
I was very flamboyant as a kid,
which is just- it's nonsense,

207
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,246
because I kept
the whole gay thing
very under wraps.

208
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:24,999
You know,
I was just a guy's guy.

209
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,959
I was basically a jock.

210
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,836
You know?

211
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,798
So we should crush
Manny's spirit...

212
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,342
and destroy everything
that makes him who he is.

213
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,845
I'm just saying,
it's no fun to see your kid
get picked on every day,

214
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,348
getting tormented
just because he's different.

215
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,517
I'm telling you,
it rips your heart out.

216
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,187
Well, Batman
doesn't get picked on
and he wears a cape.

217
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,190
A poncho is just a cape
that goes all the way around.

218
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,984
Batman doesn't get picked on
because he's a muscular genius.

219
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:54,362
Manny can't make it
to the top bunk.

220
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:58,783
We're taking this poncho to
Manny at school. It's important
that he knows we support him.

221
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,371
And then we go
get those massages,
because that sounds good.

222
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,164
[Engine Starts]

223
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,792
[Footsteps Clomping]

224
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:13,005
I always take the stairs
two at a time. I don't even
think about it anymore.

225
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,882
The regular way
would seem weird.

226
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,093
Phil, let it go.
I'm faster than you.

227
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,263
If only there was some way
we could settle this
once and for all.

228
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,348
But how?

229
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,100
Huh.

230
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,102
You seriously
wanna race me?

231
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,104
I ran a half-marathon
last year.

232
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,106
Wow.
I'm half-scared.

233
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Okay, we do
need to do this.
I'll go change.

234
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,528
Not now.
I got a conference call.
But how about after that?

235
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,072
- Great. This afternoon.
- Sweet.

236
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,659
Two at a time, two at a ti-
[Stumbles]

237
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,788
Son of a- Gotta fix that step!
Two at a time!
Already at the top, so-

238
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,960
Hi, I'm Dr. Miura.
I'm on call today.

239
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,504
Looks like we have
a little head bump.

240
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:55,882
Yeah, it happened
a couple hours ago
on a- on a doorjamb.

241
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:58,175
Uh, ouch.

242
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,886
We used to do
this thing in school...

243
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,597
where they would give you an egg
and you couldn't break it.

244
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,726
And it was supposed to
teach you how hard it was
to be a parent.

245
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,022
But the real thing,
i-it's so much harder.
You know?

246
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,400
We did that in my school too.
Didn't turn out so well.

247
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,360
I went through a dozen eggs.

248
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,029
Yeah, well,
he's a nervous eater.

249
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,489
No, I broke
a dozen eggs.
Oh.

250
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm sorry.
I just assumed that-

251
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,912
I know.

252
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,539
I know
what you assumed.

253
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:31,042
There doesn't seem
to be any mark.

254
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:34,253
Well, her head
was somewhat protected.
Protected?

255
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,423
- Was she wearing a hat?
- Yes, yes, like a hat.

256
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,594
It was a wig, actually.
Sort of a ghetto-fabulous
Afro thing.

257
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,596
I thought it might be
medically relevant.

258
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,558
Really?
You thought "ghetto-fabulous"
might be medically relevant?

259
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,145
Maybe I should just
finish with the exam.
Yes, thanks.

260
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:54,607
You'll be pleased to know
that Mitchell and I
intend on raising Lily...

261
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,693
with influences
from her Asian heritage.

262
00:12:57,778 --> 00:12:59,695
That is fantastic.

263
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,448
Have you noticed any vomiting
since the head bump?

264
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,450
Uh, no.
No, no, no.

265
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,953
We've hung some art
in her room.
Some Asian art.

266
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,955
And then when she's
ready for solid food,

267
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,957
there's a fantastic
pho place...

268
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,959
right around the corner
from our house.

269
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:17,755
Am I pronouncing that right?
Is it pho? It's a soup.

270
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,758
I don't know.
I'm from Denver.

271
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,178
We don't have
a lot of pho there.

272
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,850
Uh, just to be sure,
could you show me
how hard Lily got hit?

273
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,936
And use your head.

274
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,273
Um, yeah. Really, it was-
it was just sorta,
like, uh-

275
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:40,319
You know?
Could I
see that again?

276
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:43,030
Um, it was just-
just a head bump,
you know.

277
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,491
How are you feeling?
Uh, fine.

278
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,493
So is Lily.

279
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,496
Babies are designed
to survive new parents,
so stop worrying.

280
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,248
You guys are doing great.

281
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,668

[Bell Ringing]

284
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,225
I don't see any ponchos,

285
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,520
which means either the kids
don't wear them or the ones
who do wear them disappear.

286
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,272
We're doing
the right thing.

287

I support Manny
no matter what.

288
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:22,570
Children need to know
that you believe in them.
It's the most important thing.

289
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,365
If you tell them they have wings,
they will believe they can fly.

290
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,117
Oh, really?

291
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,078
I had a buddy,
went to Woodstock,
believed he could fly.

292
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:35,166
Didn't end great.
It's why hotel windows
don't open anymore.

293

even think that?
