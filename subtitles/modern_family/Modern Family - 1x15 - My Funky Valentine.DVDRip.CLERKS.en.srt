Oh, happy Valentine's Day.

[Clicks Tongue]
Aw!
Oh!

4
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:18,059
So, Fratelli's tonight?
Hello, cannoli canoe.

5
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,354
[Jay]
I like it. Nice fit.

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,398
Swanky material.

7
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:26,151
Jay, you look
so strong and sexy.

8
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:29,613
Like an Olympic wrestler,
but with money.
[Both Laugh]

9
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,407
Your turn.
Okay.
[Chuckles]

10
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:36,203
This is my favorite day
in America.
Happy Valentine's Day, gorgeous.

11
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,914
[Gasps]
They're huge!

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,750
Oh, my God.
Yeah, those will work.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,336
Beautiful.
You can wear 'em tonight.

14
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,047
I have a surprise.
[Gasps]

15
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:51,384
Don't tell me you're finally
taking me salsa dancing!

16
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:56,598
And who's David Brenner?
Only a Vegas legend.

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,267
Is he a magician?
'Cause I love magicians.

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,563
He's a comedian.
A comedian?
It's Valentine's Day.

19
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:06,316
I thought we were going salsa
dancing, not to watch a comedian.

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,235
You're gonna love him.
Trust me.

21
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:11,780
The guy's hilarious.
Okay, tell me
one of his jokes.

22
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,406
He doesn't do jokes.

23
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:15,992
Does he have a mallet?
No.

24
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:17,911
So then how does he
get hit in the head?

25
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,579
He doesn't get hit
in the head.

26
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,498
He- He makes observations.

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,917
He tells the truth
in a funny way.

28
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,045
Come on. He's been on
Johnny Carson a hundred times.

29
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,422
Who the hell
is Johnny Carson?
Oh, for God's sake.

30
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,591
Gloria and I are
from different generations.

31
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,885
And I won't lie-
It isn't always easy.

32
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,722
I mean, last week she thought
Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers.

33
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,225
No I didn't.
It was a joke.

34
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:43,186
I don't get it.
Maybe that's because
there's no mallet.

35
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,439
Yeah, I wish
I had a mallet right now.

36
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,441

...was to stay

37

Did you indicate to her how long
that you were gonna take?

38
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,406
Happy Valentine's Day.
Happy Valentine's Day.

39

Happy Valentine's Day,

Happy Valentine's Day, Lily.

[Clears Throat]
Notice anything different?

41
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,707
Oh, that is cute.
Cute?

42
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,875
We spent a lot of time
on this.
[Chuckles]

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,461
I don't see how.
You just cut up one of your boas.

44
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,922
Uh- Actually, no.
We repurposed it.

45
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:13,633
It was sort of
a Bob Mackie meets
Martha Stewart project.

46
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:15,885
Okay. Well, we just
thought it would be
a nice surprise.

47
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,180
It's hardly a surprise.
I mean, you dress her up
for every holiday.

48
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,765
I was giving her
a bath last night,

49
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,976
and I still saw traces
of Martin Luther King
behind her ear.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,729
- All right. Not in the spirit. We get it.
- No, I'm-I'm sorry.

51
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,731
No. It's adorable. I just-

52
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,733
I'm really nervous
about my closing argument.

53
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,943
Oh, you've been
rehearsing for weeks.
You're gonna be great.

54
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,195
Let's hope so.
Hey, and I was wondering-

55
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:37,157
Since you're gonna be
in court all day-
You can open the chocolates.

00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,368
Score.

Happy Valentine's Day,

Oh. Dylan, thank you.
That is so sweet.

I love it.
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

Seriously, you gotta
put a black light on it.
It'll blow your mind.

Wow! Dylan, I didn't
know you could paint.
Oh, I didn't.

69

I just took a photo and I
put it through this program
that turns it into a painting.

Oh.
Oh.

So you two
actually did...

that.

over my bed.

this great moment at the end...

where I would point
to the state seal

Well, Manny, why-why didn't you
just tell her the truth?

She was already gone.

at my favorite restaurant,
Great Shakes.

[Ted]
I'm not gonna recite anything.

301
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,343
Just admit you didn't
write the poem.

302
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,928
I don't know
what he's talking about.

303
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,721
Get out of here before
you get your butt kicked.

304
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,932
I'm going over there.
No, I got this.

305
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,975
[Exhales]

306
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,355
Whoa! Whoa, sir! Sir?
Turn around.

307
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,484
Sir, you have no right
to claim ownership
of another person's work.

308
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,986
- Who are you?
- I'm a lawyer.

309
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,905
You have a lawyer?

310
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,282
It is one thing to lie,

311
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,952
but then to bully this young man-
it's unforgivable.

312
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,995
[Chattering Stops]
And this is what's wrong
with the world today.

313
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,164
The big guy...

314
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:59,166
thinks that he can roll
right over the little guy...

315
00:15:59,251 --> 00:16:02,503
until the little guy says,
"Enough."

316
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,588
And that's what
this little guy's doing-

317
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,841
right here, right now.

318
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:09,301
Can we stop
calling me "little guy"?
I'm in the 40th percentile.

319
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,428
Shh. I got this.

320
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:15,099
Ted Durkas clearly
did not write that poem.

321
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,310
I know it.
He knows it.

322
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,479
Deep down
in your heart, Fiona-

323
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,898
[Exhales]
You know it too.

324
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,406
Shame!

325
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,491
Fine! Whatever.
I stole his stupid poem.

326
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,451
- [Fiona] You did?
- I told you.

327
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,995
There you go.

328
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,914
I only did it
because I had the feelings,

329
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,791
I just didn't know
how to show 'em.

330
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:45,921
Really?
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

331
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,756
You've gotta be kidding me.

332
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:50,843
- Let's get out of here.
This chick's crazy.
- Seriously.

333
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,845
I've never seen you
like that.

334
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,597
You have no idea
how good that felt.

335
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,600
Well, happy Valentine's Day,
counselor.

336
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,352
This is all happening
so fast, Juliana.

337
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,397
I know, and I have to be home
to my husband by midnight.

338
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,733
Ooh, a twist.

339
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,529
Phil!
Phil, my coat is stuck.

340
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,281
Who's Phil?
No, not now!
Seriously.

341
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,575
My coat is stuck.
Oh, oh.
Honey, take off your coat!

342
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,994
Are you kidding me?
Pull it.
Oh, my goodness.

343
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:19,371
Pull it.
Come on. Come on.

344
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,540
[Claire]
Oh, boy.
Not good. Not good.

345
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,375
[Buzzer Sounds]
[Escalator Stops]

346
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,045
[Gasps]
Okay. Okay. Okay.

347
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,088
Come on up. Treat 'em like
they're regular stairs.

348
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,840
It's okay.
Come on through.

349
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,384
Happy Valentine's Day.
You look lovely.

350
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,511
So do you.
Not in a weird way.
Yeah.

351
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:36,222
How are you? Hi.
Hi.

352
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,599
Happy Valentine's-
Let me just get in here.
Let me get in here.

353
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:39,767
Okay?
Phil?

354
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,477
Hey, Tom.
Hi.

355
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,354
How are you? Honey-

356
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:46,232
Claire, you remember
Tom Mickleson from the office
and his wife, Susan.

357
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,943
I do. Hey.
Is your coat stuck?

358
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,571
It is. It really is.
It's in there pretty darn good.

359
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:56,951
Why don't you
take it off?
Um, I'm freezing cold.

360
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,494
At least let me
give it a shot.

361
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,205
[Phil]
Oh, I don't think-
No, no, no. I got it.

362
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,873
Mr. And Mrs. Dunphy?
Hey.

363
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,542
Principal Balaban.
Hey, how are you?

364
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,170
[Claire]
Hi.
Who's Clive Bixby?

365
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,465
Oh, uh, he makes speakers.

366
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,926
He's actually in town
for a trade show.
Phil.

367
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:17,221
My, are you stuck?
Yeah, I am.
A little bit.

368
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:19,598
Why don't you take off
that coat?
Um, I'm chilly.

369
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,558
It's really
jammed in here.

370
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,270
Let me in there.
I'll get you.
No, I think we're okay.

371
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,397
Mrs. Dunphy?

372
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,607
Are you kidding me?

373
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,694
Hi! Luke's math teacher,
Ms. Passwater.

374
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,445
[Chuckling]
"Passwater."

375
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,030
[Laughter, Applause]

376
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,908
Ah, Jay, papi,
don't pay attention
to what he's saying.

377
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,452
He's just being funny.
Because he points out
the truth.

378
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,539
Those people were laughing
because they saw it too.

379
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,000
What do you care
what they think?
I don't.

380
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,127
I care what you think.

381
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,754
I love you.
You're my valentine.
Yeah, for now.

382
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,841
But what about when I'm 80
and I'm in a wheelchair,
on oxygen?

383
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,426
You still gonna want me?

384
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,846
Do you think I'm so shallow
that I'm gonna leave you
when you're old?

385
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,682
What if I gain
a hundred pounds?
You gonna leave me then?

386
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,686
No.
What's with the pause?

387
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,522
Well, it's not exactly fair.
I mean, I have to get old.

388
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,483
You don't have to get fat.
If I want to get fat, I get fat.

389
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,610
Okay, fine. And if you do,
I'll be there. You'll see.

390
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,322
Yeah, watch me.
Watch me, how I get fat.

391
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,742
I can get fat.
And I'll be there.

392
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,245
[Laughs]
Good.

393
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,289
You wanna go back in?
No.

394
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,333
I got a better idea.

395
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,002
Let's go salsa dancing.
This guy's not that funny.

396
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,296
[Gasps]
Perfect.

397
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,342
We're good! We're good!
I talked to Maintenance.

398
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,552
They're- They're-
They're coming, so go on ahead.

399
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,055
See you guys.
See you later.

400
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,182
See you in school.
Good to see you guys.

401
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,892
Maintenance is gonna
take care of it.

402
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:48,103
So we're fine.
Okay. Okay, how long
till they get here?

403
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,189
I was faking it.
No one's coming for us.

404
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,274
Well, then, go and get them!
Hurry!

405
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,069
That was the most
embarrassing moment
of my life.

406
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,112
Claire! Phil!

407
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,948
Stand by.

408
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,784
Hey.

409
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,453
- What, did you get your belt stuck?
- I did. Yeah.

410
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,080
Take your coat off.
Here, let me help you.

411
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,998
No, no, Dad.
Dad, I'm fine.
Come on!

412
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,750
What are you, naked under there?

413
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:14,088
Aw, geez.
It's okay.

414
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,548
I got this.
Okay.

415
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,592
Claire,
follow my lead, okay?

416
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,470
Okay.

417
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,645
[Claire]
Wow. Okay.

418
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,024
Thank you.
It has happened
to me before.

419
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,527
That was impressive.

420
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,946
Take it down a notch,
Clive.

421
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,199
[Phil]
You okay?
Yeah. I'm good.

422
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,575
All right.
I'm good.

423
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,369
Happy Valentine's Day.
[Claire]
Happy Valentine's Day.

424
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,829
Chao.
Okay. See ya.

425
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,122
Bye.
Good night.

426
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,957
Oh. That's-
[Laughs]

427
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:53,001
Sorry.
See you, guys.

428
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,756
[Claire]
Hi, honey.

429
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,676
[Phil On Speaker]
Hey, I just wanted to tell you
how great you were last night.

430
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:04,721
Uh, Phil-
Sorry I got the, uh-
the oil everywhere, but, hey—

431
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:07,933
Uh, sweetie-
They're not our sheets, right?

432
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,102
Honey- Honey, remember
when the salesman told us...

433
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:12,396
that the Sienna was built with
the whole family in mind?

434
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,731
Yeah.
Well, the whole family
just heard that.

435
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,359
Uh- Uh- Guess-

436
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,403
I guess the Bluetooth works.

437
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,614
Mmm.
Why did you have oil?

438
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,951
Because, buddy,
we were making French fries.

439
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,536
In your room?

440
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,205
[Claire]
Why don't you guys
just pop in a DVD?
