They sure do,
and this one must've got up
for a midnight snack.

149
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:14,225
You know,
we've all done that.

150
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,768
I guess so.
Yeah.

151
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,353
It all adds up.

152
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:20,857
I don't think
I can be in here right now.
Too many memories.

153
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,401
He'll be okay.

154
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,154
You lie.
What?

155
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,866
I'm Colombian.
I know a fake crime scene
when I see one.

156
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,203
I was hanging up the new poster
and it fell on top of him.

157
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,164
It was an accident.
You have to tell him.

158
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,166
No. I've been
through this before.

159
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,793
When Mitchell was nine,
I was supposed to take care
of his bird.

160
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:44,797
It got out and flew into a fan.
It was like a bloody pillow fight.

161
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,258
My God. How many pets
have you killed?
Just the two.

162
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:49,302
I took the heat on the bird.
It was a big mistake.

163
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,387
To this day,
Mitchell looks at me,

164
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:54,432
I see him thinking,
"That's the guy
who killed Fliza Minnelli."

165
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,476
And what if he finds out?
Then what?

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,145
You'll be the guy
that killed his pet
and lied to him.

167
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,148
He's not gonna find out
because I covered my tracks.

168
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,400
Okay.

169
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,611
Fliza Minnelli?

170
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,364
How did I not know
that kid was gay?

171
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,117
Hey, Luke.

172
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,994
Big day for you, huh?
Why?

173
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,830
- Because you will get
to meet your real mom.
- What?

174
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,000
[Scoffs]
We all made a pact we'd
deny it until you turned 21.

175
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:25,171
But that's the real reason
Dad's old girlfriend's
coming over.

176
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,883
She's your mom,
and if she likes you,
you'll go live with her.

177
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,886
I'm not adopted.
I'm asking Mom.

178
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,473
You mean Mrs. Dunphy?
She's not going
to tell you the truth.

179
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,141
I-I'm not-

180
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,435
I know.
[Whimpers]

181
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:47,026
Just 'cause he called you
a dork-to-dork salesman?

182
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:49,070
The empire strikes back.

183
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,322
Raccoons have five toes.

184
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,033
What's that?
I don't mean to bother you.

185
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:57,912
It's just confusing.
The footprints in my room
only have four toes.

186
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,331
You know, I bet
I know what happened.

187
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,376
I'll bet he lost
those toes in a fight.

188
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,920
And that guy looked like
he'd been in a brawl or two.

189
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,464
- One toe from each foot?
- Maybe.

190
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,050
You know, Manny,
I think the only thing...

191
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:13,970
that's gonna get you to stop
asking all these questions...

192
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,972
is for you to have a little closure.

193
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,225
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'd like to throw
a little memorial for Shel.

194
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,186
It'll be good for all of us.
That way we get our grief out,

195
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:27,525
and then we never have to talk
about this ever, ever again.

196
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,529
[Doorbell Rings]

197
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,949
Hi. Oh, careful.
There's a thing.

198
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,993
[Squealing]
Yeah. Good to see you.

199
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,953
Hi!

200
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,122
Hi! Oh, my God.
Hi. I'm Claire.

201
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,124
You must be- Oh.
Yeah. Hi.

202
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,168
Denise.
Well- Okay.

203
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:48,463
You're even prettier
than the pictures
that Phil's always posting.

204
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,465
- Just a couple.
- Oh?

205
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:52,884
Shut up. Every week.
He loves showing you off.

206
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,262
And my boyfriend likes
your Acapulco pictures,
probably a little too much.

207
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,890
[Chuckles]
Well, thank
your boyfriend for me.

208
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,433
Come on in, please.

209
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,520
Oh, I brought you, um,
some lifting intensifier.

210
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:08,399
- Not that you need it.
It's a limited edition, so-
- Thank you. Thank you.

211
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:10,777
Oh, Denise, I think you
might know these people.

212
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,320
Uh, that's Haley-
Hi.

213
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,156
- Alex and-
- Luke. Oh!

214
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,201
I had curly hair just like that
when I was little.

215
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,579
So? That doesn't
mean anything.

216
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,415
[Whimpering]

217
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,960
Why don't we,
uh, come on in,
have a seat. Please.

218
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,046
So what was my dad like
in high school?

219
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,840
Only the most amazing
break-dancer ever.

220
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,968
[Haley] No way.
Oh, don't fire it up.
What? What?

221
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,595
Oh, no.
Yeah.

222
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,014
He had a boom box
and a piece of cardboard
in his locker.

223
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,141
And what was
your dance name?
O-Zone. Yeah.

224
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,143
I drove him to his
Star Search audition.

225
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:47,021
- Which is totally political, by the way.
- [Haley] O-Zone.

226
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,858
- That is dead-ass funny.
I'm so calling you that.
- Thank you.

227
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,152
Wow. You really lucked out.

228
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,738
You have a beautiful wife,
a gorgeous house.
Oh.

229
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,616
And those kids-
I could take Luke home with me.

230
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,576
Well, be my guest.

231
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,079
Seriously,
you go right ahead.
[Laughing]

232
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,040
No! I like it here!

233
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,751
[Whimpers]

234
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:11,337
Alex, honey, will you
go find out what's wrong
with your brother?

235
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,339
Okay.

236
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,009
You know, um, if it's okay,
I think I'm just gonna use the, um-

237
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,011
Oh, yeah. Of course.
Down the hall.

238
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,514
Left-hand side.
You can't miss it.
Thanks.

239
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,435
Okay, she's fantastic.
Yes?

240
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,314
Yes. I feel awful.
When did I become this
horribly cynical person...

241
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,358
who assumes the worst
about people?

242
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,986
I first noticed it seven years-
You're not.

243
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,864
[Denise]
Such an idiot. Is it-

244
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,533
Oh, I'll show you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Thanks.

245
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,830
[Clears Throat]
So how are we
gonna do this?

246
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,999
I thought I'd just
point at the door.

247
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,002
So I was thinking-
I was thinking too.

248
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,881
Here...
is my hotel room key.

249
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,300
You can come by
whenever you want.

[Door Closes]

251
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,687
That was funny
this morning, huh-

252
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,731
when I pulled up next to you
at that stoplight?

253
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,775
- Funny?
- Yeah. Because I was on
the phone with my partner...

254
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,445
talking about how horrible
his boss was- his.

255
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,447
And then you pull up. So-

256
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,198
Anyway, I'm glad
I ran into you.

257
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,242
I'm getting worried they're
gonna move up our court date.

258
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,536
- I need you to bust ass preparing.
- [Cell Phone Rings]

259

'Cause if they
call us on Monday-
[Ringing Continues]

260
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,165
Uh, you need to get that?

261
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,001
No. It's fine.
It's just a...

262
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,003
picture of my daughter
standing for the first time.

263
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,506
Yeah, they do that.
It's a big day. Anyway,
I need you here tomorrow.

264
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:41,385
I know it's a Sunday,
but, uh, you think
you can be on time, okay?

00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,223
Actually, um,
I have plans tomorrow,

266
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,351
uh, so I won't be here.

267
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:54,357
I-I have plans to stay
at home with my family and
do absolutely nothing. Okay.

268
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,859
But I will see you
on Monday.
Mm-hmm.

269
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,945
So, you're in charge now,
is that it?

270
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,989
Well, I just figure if my daughter
can stand up, then so can I.

00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:06,661
All right, look. We've all been
working hard lately, okay?

272
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:10,706
But that's the job.
So either come in tomorrow or
don't bother coming back again.

I don't think I can
do this without crying.

get to the cold cuts.

- I left a bag of chips near my bed.

must have smelled it.
It's my fault he's dead.

00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,301
[Exhales]
Yeah.

296
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,304
Manny.

297
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,727
Shel forgives you.

298
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,771
Thank you.

299
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:01,275
Oh, Denise.
[Chuckles]

300
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,861
These pictures are amazing.
Thank you.

301
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,489
Wow. Sweetie, that perm.

302
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,824
Technically, that's a Jheri curl.
[Claire] Oh.

303
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:12,119
I just love to take pictures.
I took this one of myself today.

304
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,039
[Exhales]
Oh.

305
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,750
You know what?
I'm gonna open
a bottle of wine.

306
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,211
No. No.
That's the worst idea.
Come on. You'll love it.

307
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,797
No, no.
I'm not in the mood.

308
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,882
What am I, raised
by a pack of wolves?

309
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,675
[Laughs]
Hey. Come on now.

310
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,761
Honey.

311
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,013
You weren't completely
wrong about Denise.

312
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,640
- How's that?
- She wants me.

313
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,768
- To do what?
- It. Her.

314
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,105
Oh. Oh, this is because
of the thing I said
about Facebook...

315
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,357
and everybody's hooking up,
and now you're disappointed.

316
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:44,902
No. She bit the air
right in front of me. Like that.

317
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,904
And then look
what she tried to give me.

318
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,948
[Denise]
Anything I can help with?
No.

319
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:52,743
I can't find my corkscrew.
[Denise]
Oh.

320
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:56,747
[Whispers] Touch me.
Okay. Denise, somewhere along
the line you got the wrong idea.

321
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,666
My head is full of wrong ideas.

322
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:02,628
You have such
great taste, Claire.
Thank you.

323
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,589
I remember Phil used to have
really good taste too.

324
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,591
Let me get a little of this.
Oh, here it is.

325
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,844
Phil, would you mind grabbing
us a couple glasses?
You betcha.

326
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,054
Need me to grab anything?
No!

327
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,682
- Okay, this is so wrong.
- I know.

328
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,892
It's way more exciting when
she's in the room, isn't it?
No.

329
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,728
I still have my cheerleader outfit.
So do I.

330
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,690
But this still can't happen.
When did that break?

331
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,943
- Why are you wussing out?
- I never wussed in.

332
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,028
What about all those things
you wrote on Facebook?

333
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,447
[Breathy]
"How was your day?
My neck is so sore."

334
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,409
Why do people keep
adding voices to these things?
I didn't mean anything.

335
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,745
Are you telling me
that I wasted a year of my life
on this relationship?

336
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,540
- What relationship?
- How many other women
have you led on?

337
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:42,251
- Now I don't know!
- [Claire] Phil?

338
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:48,340
Phil, honey.
[Running]

339
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,510
Do you remember
when you broke your arm
when we were first dating?

340
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,512
Yeah, uh, when I slipped
on the ice.

341
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:55,764
Right. That's so weird.
Because in this picture,

342
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,726
you're sitting with Denise
and you have a broken arm, so-

343
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,811
Yeah, that's- that's weird.

344
00:17:00,896 --> 00:17:03,939
- So you were still dating her
when you started dating me?
- No.

345
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,733
- Phil?
- Yeah. Maybe.

346
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:07,735
There was a time, a little overlap...

347
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,820
when, uh, I was trying
to break things off with Denise.

348
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,822
Uh-huh.
You took me
to Santa Fe.

349
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:15,534
Santa Fe?
Phil, you told me
that was your father.

350
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,204
Okay, I know the pain is fresh,
but the lie is really old.

351
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:22,041
You know, this was a mistake.
I'm gonna leave.

352
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,835
Claire, if I were you,
I would kick him out.

353
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,380
Maybe he'd appreciate you more
after he spent a lonely night
in a hotel.

354
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,758
At the Radisson,
by the airport.

355
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,219
[Door Opens, Closes]

356
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,721
You quit?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
It was amazing.

357
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,431
No, no.
This is the new me, Cam.

358
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,142
I am not letting people
run my life anymore.

359
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,686
I should be nervous, but I'm not.
I'm excited for you.

360
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,064
Yes! It's exciting!
It's exciting.

361
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,108
Because you followed your heart,
and that is worth celebrating.

362
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:50,069
Cam, I just feel-
[Laughs]

363
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,197
So liberated.

364
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,033
- Hey.
- And I'm not picking it up.

365
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,285
- Ooh! I like this guy.
- I do too.

366
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:00,579
Yes, we'll have
to cut back a little bit.

367
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:03,707
But isn't it worth it if
you feel like you're living
your life for the first time?

368
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,709
Totally.
What were we
even waiting for?

369
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,711
You will go back
to teaching music,

370
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,339
and then I'll just find something
in a... few months.

371
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,925
And until then,
all we need to do
is just sit back...

372
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,011
and watch this little
miracle here dazzle us.

373
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,514
I'm tingling.
I am too.

374
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,600
It's like my heart is full
for the first time in forever.

375
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:24,561
Oh, God, it's really pounding.
[Patting Back]

376
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:27,815
It's like I feel the weight
of endless possibilities
just sitting on my chest-

377
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,150
- She is not doing anything, Cam.
- You're not panicking, are you?

378
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,653
Of course I am panicking.
No. Don't panic.
If you panic, I panic!

379
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,699
I just quit my job. Cam!
My God. Mitchell,
I am used to nice things.

380
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,410
What are we gonna do?
Okay. No, no.
Just calm down.

381
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,830
This is what we're gonna do.
I am going to- I'm gonna do
what I'm trained to do.

382
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,582
I am going to lie,
grovel, debase myself
until I get what I want.

383
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,126
I am a lawyer, damn it.

384
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,796
Mitchell! No.

385
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,381
Oh, no, you're right.
The tie.

386
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,508
No. We'll find
something better for you,

387
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,510
something that works
for all of us.

388
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,762
There's no Plan "B" here, Cam.

389
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:03,058
We have a mortgage. We have-
We have a child to support.

390
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,185
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

391
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,354
We're gonna figure it out.

392
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:10,107
I just want you to be happy,
and you will be happy.

393
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,777
And that is something
worth toasting.

394
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,907
Let's just drink the cheap stuff,
'cause we might have to sell that bottle.

395
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,539
- [Jay Groans]
- It's hard to sleep in a bed of lies.

396
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,001
Isn't it, Jay?
Kids get over
these things pretty quick.

397
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,211
He's probably sleeping
like a baby right now.

398
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,423
I'm sure he's wide awake,
full of guilt.

399
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,508
Well, I'm going to sleep.

400
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,809
[Jay Sighs]

401
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:47,895
Damn it!

402
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,318
Hello, Jay.

403
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,363
- What are you doing up?
- Waiting.

404
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,492
- Waiting for what?
- The truth. It wasn't a raccoon, was it?

405
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,703
Oh, all right. You got me.
I killed Shel.

406
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,081
All right? I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

407
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,959
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because I didn't want you
to be upset with me.

408
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,545
You and I got off to a rocky start.

409
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,464
Lately, it's been pretty good.

410
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:19,259
I was afraid I'd mess all
that up if you knew that I was
the one that killed your pet.

411
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,137
Now you're the guy
who killed my pet and made
a stupid lie about it.

412
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,432
Well, I don't think it was stupid.
I thought it was pretty clever.

413
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,685
I was just trying
to avoid past mistakes.

414
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,105
Look.

415
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:35,234
I know I can't make things
all better right now,
but maybe over time.

416
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,694
Maybe.

417
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,446
Get some rest.

418
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,907
Since we're confessing things,

419
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,951
you know
that scratch on your car?

420
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,828
The one that can't
be buffed out? Yeah?

421
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,872
- You should probably know
how it happened.
- I know how it happened.

422
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,042
Raccoon did it.

423
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,838
Good night, Jay.
Good night, kid.

424
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:02,177
Best thing I ever did
was quit a miserable job
and start my own business.

425
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,471
- Thanks, Dad.
- No, it's not gonna be easy.

426
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:07,975
That's why Gloria and I wanna
give you a little something
to help you through it.

427
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,311
- No, Dad, I can't.
- No. I want to, Mitch.

428
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,815
Okay, but as soon
as I'm back on my feet,
I really want to-

429
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,026
Oh. Oh, Dad. No. You-

430
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,988
You tried to give me this 20 years ago
when my pet snake died.

431
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,823
I did?
Yes.

432
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,659
Zsa Zsa Gaboa?
Oh, that's adorable.

433
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,203
And you really didn't know
that he was gay?

434
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,289
I must've, right?

435
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,254
