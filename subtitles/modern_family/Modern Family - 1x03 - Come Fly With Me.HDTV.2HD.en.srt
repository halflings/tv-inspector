00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:08,703
Hey, i though you were gonna take out the garbage.
I am.

2
00:00:14,242 --> 00:00:17,010
Phil.
Yes, getting it.

3
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,916
I was --
I was gonna get it.

4
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:27,554
Dylan.

5
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:30,390
Hey, mrs. Dunphy.
Um, I'm just waiting for haley.

6
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,892
Did you ring the bell?

7
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,761
I texted. She said she'd
be down in just a minute.

8
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,364
Oh, great.
Tell her I said hi.
I will.

9
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:39,165
Dylan!
D-money!

10
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:42,335
Chillin'
with dylan the villain.

Hey, come on in.

13
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:47,574
You're just in time
to catch the end of the game.

14
00:00:47,642 --> 00:00:49,209
Oh, I'm not really
a baseball guy.

15

[ cellphone beeps ]
haley says hi.

16
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:52,012
I-I was just being facetious.

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,214
Come on.
I'll catch you up.

18
00:00:54,282 --> 00:00:55,882
Sit it. Park it.

19
00:00:57,752 --> 00:00:59,019
Come on, I don't bite.

20
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:01,788

21
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:03,657
[ chuckles ]
I'm kidding.

22
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,725
Okay, see that guy?
He's the tying run.

23
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,427
Interesting story
about him.

24
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:09,162
He's been stuck
on second base forever,

25
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,298
And I'm pretty sure
he's gonna try and steal third,

26
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:13,967
Which is just
a terrible, terrible idea.

27
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:16,169
How are you
and haley doing?

28
00:01:21,976 --> 00:01:24,744
I wish I could stay home
with you and fly toy airplanes.

29
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:26,579
These aren't toy airplanes,
manny.

30
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:28,982
These are models,
and they're very complicated.

31
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,684
You want to fly
one of these,

32
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,753
You got to be familiar with
airfoil, drag, lift, and thrust,

33
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:36,256
And these are all principles
of aerodynamics.

34
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:38,158
The box says, "12 and up."

35
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:40,360
What?!

36
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,296
You can fly toy planes
with jay next time.

37
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,031
Today you have to spend time
with luke.

38
00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:48,168
Why?
Because his mother
invited you, so you go.

39
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:50,270
Family needs to be close,
right, jay?

40
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:52,539
I'm pretty sure
this is a typo.

41
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,974
Men need their hobbies.

42
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:56,142
Manny's father
had many hobbies,

43
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,510
Like hiking in the desert,

44
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:00,413
That kind of skiing
that they drop you from the...

45
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:02,549
How do you say in english?
The [imitates helicopter]

46
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,451
Helicopter.
Yes.

47
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:07,354
Once, on a dare,
he even boxedd with an alligator.

48
00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:08,688
Wrestle.

49
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,458
You wrestle --
you can't box with alligators.

50
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,859
Are you sure?

51
00:02:12,927 --> 00:02:15,295
How would they get the gloves
on those lile claws?

52
00:02:15,363 --> 00:02:17,263
Aren't they like tiny,
little hands?

53
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,132
No!

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,601
Okay, now I forgot
what we were talking about.

55
00:02:21,669 --> 00:02:24,170
Anyways, hobbies are important
for the men,

56
00:02:24,238 --> 00:02:26,172
Whether you're
risking your life

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,009
Or flying little planes
from a safe distance.

58
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:34,180
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
what are you doing?

59
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,016
We're just gonna
buy some diapers.

60
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,951
It'll just take
a second.

61
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,019
This is costco.

62
00:02:39,086 --> 00:02:40,920
Yeah, which is where
we buy diapers.

63
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:42,288
Since when?

64
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:44,090
Do you remember
when we adopted that baby

65
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:45,291
A few months back?

66
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,459
Since then.

67
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,430
Mitchell is a snob.

68
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:53,066
No, n-no,
I'm -- I'm discerning.

69
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:56,202
Official slogan for snobs.

70
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,438
When we first met,
he wouldn't even look at me

71
00:02:58,506 --> 00:03:00,507
Because I was a hick
from the farm in missouri

72
00:03:00,574 --> 00:03:03,309
And he's a big city mouse.

73
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:05,078
Who says "city mouse"?

74
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:06,446
Country mice.

I think I'm gonna
go wait in the car.

77
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:12,786
Okay.

78
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,788
Hey, if you're on your way out,
can you grab the garbage?

79
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:17,424
I got it.
Okay, we got it.

80
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,292
He's a little jumpy.

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,028
Oh, go figure -- a teenage boy
doesn't want to hang out

82
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:23,229
With his girlfriend's dad.

83
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,898
I thought
we were past all that.

84
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,666
I'm all about...

85
00:03:26,734 --> 00:03:28,802
I'm all about taking it
to the next level.

86
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:29,936
Really?

87
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,072
I thought you were all about
keeping it real.

88
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:33,873
Yes, but the whole point
of keeping it real

89
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,974
Is so you can take it
to the next level.

90
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:36,576
Did you really
not know that?

<i>You haven't exactly taken it
to the next level with my dad.</i>

What are you
talking about?

to play with luke.

 It's called "empire."

106
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:21,060
You use strategy
to expand territories

00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,328
And take over the world.

108

Luke is gonna love that.
He's out back playing.

but I think we're good. Thanks.

Okay, what about this?

You don't even say hello

Okay, mom,

00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,312
No, you're wearing a dress.

mom, come on!
What?

It's gonna kill you to look
like a girl for one afternoon?

119
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:45,885
But it's a wedding
for some friend of yours

120
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,053
That I never even
heard of.

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,187
It's nonnegotiable.

122
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,755
You can borrow a dress
of haley's again.

123
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:52,291
No, that sends
an ugly message --

124
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,759
That I'm haley.

125
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,595
You know, instead of trying
to force me to wear a dress,

126
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,532
Why don't you worry about
getting luke to wear some pants?

127
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,168
What?

128
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,203
Why does he do this?

129
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,939

130
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,874

Um, he's not, uh --
he's not a talker...

Or -- or a hugger.

135
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:28,227
Once, he ran over my foot
with his car.

136
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,030
To -- to be fair,
he had just given up smoking.

137
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,898
But, basically, we're buds.

138
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,168
Do you have to
just stand there?

139
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,404
You're making me
feel uneasy.

140
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,239

Here, hold this wing like this
while I adjust this.

00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,048
Okay.

00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:51,417
Come on. Here.

00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:01,694
Not too hard.

147
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,196
Okay.

148
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,465
Alex, why don't you
come shopping with me?

149
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,502
Maybe I can help you find
something that you like.

150
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,772
That's a really nice offer,
but it's not really her thing.

151
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,274
Actually,
I'd love to go.

152
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,109
See, you don't know
what my thing is.

153

You have no idea
what my thing is.

I know what your thing is.

00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,348
Your thing is to provoke,

00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,025
Mm-hmm.

162
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,729
Our relationship's
always been stuck

163
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:40,232
In that primal place
where it started.

164
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,801
You know,
he's the old silverback

165
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,002
Protecting his females.

00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,337
Then along comes this younger,
stronger gorilla,

167

Swinging in, beating his chest,
you know.

Naturally,
the ape ladies come running,

their nice scarlet behinds.

Papa ape wants to stop all that,
but he can't, you know.

00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:59,652
That's -- that's life.
I'm not the enemy.

172
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:02,021
The enemy is poachers.

Oh, hey.

and the soap.

Good. Now we can open
that general store.

181

I thought we were just here
to get diapers.

182

We had a saying
on the farm --

183
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,989
As long as you're bringing
the mule to the market, you --

I feel you
rolling your eyes at me.

185
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,360
We met at one of pepper's
legendary game nights.

186
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,662
I remember mitchell
because he kept rolling his eyes

Every time I would get
a little boisterous.

We were --
we were playing charades,

00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,874
And I-I had no idea
how to act out my clue,

to do was...

the diapers and get out of here?

Oh, right, I guess, technically,
I would be your stepsister.

My mother says we are never
to use the word "step"

223
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,013
Because it means
"not real,"

And we are
a real family.
Mm.

You don't have to tell me.
My school is full of them.

We can go and do

Two girls out
for an afternoon of fun.

Well, you can still

Yeah, adults always say that,

00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,959
They sell baby formula,
and they sell coffins.

322
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,661
You can literally buy
everything you need

323
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:16,762
From birth to death.

324
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,931
Oh, my god,
look at these diapers.

325
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,200
[ gasps ]
look how cheap they are!

326
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,601
Oh, you know
what we should do?

327
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,170
We should get enough for like
the next year or two, right?

328
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:26,672
Where would we keep them?

329
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,940
They sell sheds.

330
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,909
Really?
You want to buy a diaper shed.

331
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,745
We're those guys now?
The guys with the diaper shed?

332
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,346
Just grab two more.

333
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,615
I'm not grabbing two more,
mitchell. It's time to go.

334
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:38,184
No, come on, come on.
We need a --

335
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,153
Excuse me. Where did you
get that flatbed thing?

336
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:43,589
Over there.
Go grab
one of those.

337
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,723
Really?
Yeah.

338
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,926
Get two.

339
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,529
I'm in the applesauce aisle!

340
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:54,099
So, anyways, after charades,
we went out for coffee,

341
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,569
And I learned
that he loves art,

342
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,438
He plays the piano,
he speaks french.

343
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,639
<i>Un peu.</i>

344
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,908
So, you know,
I-I misjudged him.

345
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,810
Yeah, I'm sort of
like costco.

346
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,980
I'm big, I'm not fancy,
and I dare you to not like me.

347
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,915
Yeah, and I'm kind of
more like that, um...

348
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,417
Oh.

349
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:13,819
What is the name of that little
shop we went to in paris?

350
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,388
You are such a snob.

351
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,459
"casablanca."

352
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,363
I have a small flower
on my ankle

353
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:25,932
And a tiny, little butterfly
on my...

354
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,601
Thigh.

355
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:29,002
How high up?

356
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,303
Very high.

357
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:32,105
Did you do it
to look sexy?

358
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:33,907
No, did you do it
for a guy?

359
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,275
Does grandpa like it?

360
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,677
No, no, and yes.

361
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:39,846
That's gross.
Mm.

362
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,348
Let's go back
to your piercings.

363
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,449
No, no, no.

364
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:44,384
I've answered enough
of your questions.

365
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,286
Now it's your turn
to answer one.

366
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,321
What is it?

367
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,023
Why you don't want
to wear a dress?

368
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,225
Because I don't want
to look like haley

369
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:53,460
And her stupid friends.

370
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:56,196
I wear dresses,
and I don't look like haley.

371
00:14:56,264 --> 00:14:59,499
<i>You are haley,
just...40 years older.</i>

372
00:14:59,567 --> 00:15:00,834
10.
20.

373
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:01,935
Deal.

374
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,538
Alex, why are you fighting me
on this?

375
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:06,306
It doesn't matter
if I dress up.

376
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:08,108
I'm not pretty
like haley and you.

377
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:09,910
That's ridiculous!
You're beautiful!

378
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,011
I'm not.

379
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,479
But that's okay.

380
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,114
I'm the smart one.

381
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:18,752
Hmm, the cute busboy doesn't
know that you're smart.
What?

382
00:15:18,819 --> 00:15:20,720
He's been smiling at you every
time he comes to the table.

383
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:22,122
He does not!

384
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:25,292
Why do you think we are
the only people with bread?

385
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:29,663
Look, one day,
you are going to want

386
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,231
To date a cute guy
like that.

387
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:34,834
When that day comes, you're
gonna want to look beautiful,

388
00:15:34,902 --> 00:15:36,703
And then
you'll wear a dress.

389
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,141
So, you ever kiss
another girl?

390
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,910
That's no way to talk
to your grandmother.

391
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:46,079
Was my mom hard on me
growing up?

392
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,281
Yeah, she was,
but you know what?

393
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:50,750
Back then, everything
was betty friedan

394
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:51,885
And gloria steinem.

395
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,253
They didn't understand --

396
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:55,755
<i>Gloria:
Hola. We're back.
Alex: Hello.</i>

397
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:56,923
Hey, how'd it go?

398
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,693
It was great.
Did you have fun with luke?

399
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,529
Well, not --
we had a great time.

400
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:06,266
Alex, I've been thinking,
and...

401
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,068
If you don't want to wear
a dress to the wedding,

402
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,703
It's not the end
of the world.

403
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,105
It's all right.

404
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:13,440
I bought one.

405
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:14,841
[ both laugh ]

406
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,476
Do you see how she has to
provoke me?

407
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:17,877
We'll talk about it
next week.

408
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,946
[ phil groaning,
pounding on door ]

409
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,916
Jay: Clear the way.
Coming through. Coming through.

410
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:25,118
Ow! Ow!
I need to rest my face.

411
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:26,052
You're fine.

412
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,221
You'll be all right.

413
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:30,156
Oh, my god! Dad!

414
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:31,891
Little accident.
Nothing big.

415
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,126
I was in a plane crash.

416
00:16:33,194 --> 00:16:34,427
What happened?

417
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:36,696
We were threading the needle,
and somebody moved.

418
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:38,765
No, I didn't.
You did it on purpose.

419
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,868
That's the painkiller talking.
He's a little loopy.

420
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:43,203
How bad is it?

421
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,072
Well, the wing is cracked,
the propeller's bent,

422
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,307
But I can --
I mean phil.

423
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,209
I was in a plane crash.

424
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:50,443
Thanks, dad.

425
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,278
I didn't ask him to be there.
He insisted.

426
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,314
He took a chance.
This is what happened.

427
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:56,249
Kind of like the time
you ran over his foot?

428
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:57,250
You ran over
his foot?

429
00:16:57,318 --> 00:16:58,385
That was an accident.

430
00:16:58,452 --> 00:16:59,853
You know, dad,
you did it on purpose.

431
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,287
We all saw the tire marks
on the lawn.

432
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,288
I had just quit smoking.

433
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,356
[ phil groans ]

434
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,924
See, you're upsetting
your husband.

435
00:17:04,992 --> 00:17:06,993
Water.
I'll get it.

436
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:10,263
[ sighs ]

437
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:11,598
You okay?

438
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,200
Gloria.
Thank god you're here.

439
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,936
Don't worry.
I'm here, too.

440
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,872
Who's this?

441
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,507
Jay:
Wasn't my fault.

442
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:23,243
Oh, I have seen you thread
the needle a million times.

443
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,378
You never miss.
Yeah, I must be getting old.

444
00:17:25,446 --> 00:17:27,614
Why don't you just admit it?
You never liked phil.

445
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:29,516
And put that down.
You do not get a cookie.

446
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:30,984
Jay: I like phil.

447
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,620
It's just that sometimes
he tries too hard, you know?

448
00:17:33,688 --> 00:17:36,456
And it's just kind of...
Irritating.

449
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,891
Okay, maybe he tries
too hard

450
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,426
Because you make zero effort
with him.

451
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,593
You know what?

452
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,328
In the 16 years
that we've been married,

453
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,298
Have you one time told him
that you liked him?

454
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:47,400
<i>Not in those
exact words, no.</i>

455
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:49,102
<i>No, not in any words, dad.</i>

456
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,138
<i>How do you think
that makes me feel?</i>

457
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,606
Water.

458
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:55,341
You've never told your son
that you love him?

459
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,744
Whoa, whoa,
when did we jump to "love"?

460
00:17:57,812 --> 00:17:59,913
And he's technically
not my son.

461
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,348
Ah. So that means that you
don't love manny, either?

462
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,650
Well, sure I do.

463
00:18:03,718 --> 00:18:05,285
I mean, believe me,
when I was in that park,

464
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,986
I really wished
manny was there.

465
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:08,455
For what --

466
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,058
So that you could fly
the plane into his head? Huh?

467
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:15,462
Dad, thanks so much
for bringing phil home.

468
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,331
I found one of your little flaps
in his hair, so...

469
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:23,470
Actually, this is called
an aileron. It controls the --

470
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,638
Yeah, 'cause that's what matters
right now.

471
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,574
Bye, dad.

472
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:38,985
Hey, phil.

473
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,320
Phil: Jay.

474
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,125
Ow!

475
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:46,793
What,
are you made of china?

476
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:47,994
[ groans ]

477
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:51,464
Phil, I just want you to know,
I'm sorry.

478
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:54,601
And whether I missed
or you moved --

479
00:18:54,668 --> 00:18:55,702
I didn't.

480
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,504
Either way...

481
00:18:57,571 --> 00:19:00,273
I just want to say
that I like you.

482
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:01,741
Really?

483
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,042
Yeah.

484
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,678
What do you like about me?

485
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,416
You're a nice guy.

486
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:13,486
You try real hard.

487
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:15,655
I do.

488
00:19:15,723 --> 00:19:16,823
You're a good dad.

489
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:18,858
<i>I am a good dad.
Come here.</i>

490
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:20,794
Come here, you.

491
00:19:20,861 --> 00:19:22,095
[ groans ]

492
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,164
This feels so right.

493
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,999
[ groans ]
[ door opens ]

494
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,901
What's going on?

495
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,569
There was
a little accident,

496
00:19:29,637 --> 00:19:31,838
But jay's telling phil
how much he loves him.

497
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:34,274
Oh, well,
that's nice for phil.

498
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,309
That's great, since he's never said 
anything like that to my boyfriend.

499
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,510
Let it go.

500
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:39,312
No, it's not okay.
Mitch is right.

501
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,247
You go in there, too, cam.
Come on.

502
00:19:41,315 --> 00:19:42,715
You're kidding.

503
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,017
Jay!

504
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:45,084
Come on in, cam.

505
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,153
A ttle hug?
Get in here.

506
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,822
[ all grunting ]

507
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:50,089
Say it, say it!

508
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:51,424
I like you, too, cam.

509
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:54,127
What do you like
about him?
Oh, geez.

510
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,229
Where did you get
that camera?

511
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,598
Only the greatest store
on earth.

512
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,034
Thanks, dad.

513
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,702
Manny, picture.
Get in there, too.

514
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,204
Phil:
Get in here, manny.

515
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,939
[ mitchell laughs ]

516
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:06,040
Say, "cheese!"

517
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,208
Don't push it.

518
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,876
Together: Cheese!
Picture!

519
00:20:08,944 --> 00:20:10,511
Cheese!
Cheese! Queso!

520
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,645
[ laughter ]

521
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:12,913
Cameron: How beautiful!

522
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,481
Jay: Oh, boy!

523
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,117
Phil: Doesn't it feel like his
arms could go around the world?

524
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:19,526
I think I strained something.

525
00:20:22,423 --> 00:20:23,423
I always wanted a daughter.

526
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,007
To dress her up
with pretty dresses,-

527
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:29,844
Do her hair, her nails,
her makeup.

528
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:31,512
[ chuckles ]

529
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:35,616
No one knows this, but for
the first year of his life,

530
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:36,784
I made up manny
like a girl

531
00:20:36,852 --> 00:20:38,786
And told everybody
that he was my daughter.

532
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:40,455
[ laughs ]

533
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,457
But just for a few times.

534
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,725
I didn't want to mess
with his head.

535
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:46,194
When he found the pictures,
I told him

536
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:50,131
That it was his twin sister
who died, you know.

537
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:53,132
