1
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:45,752
Gloria? He better cool it,
or I'm gonna introduce him

2
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:48,255
To the captain and tennille.

3
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,958
sorry we're late. I was at work.

4
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:53,360
Oh, he loves to say that.

5
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,561
Happy barbecue. Oh.

6
00:00:54,595 --> 00:00:56,496
Since mitchell is
between jobs... Wow!

7
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,899
...I've taken a part-time job
at a greeting-card store,

8
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,134
Which I love.

9
00:01:01,168 --> 00:01:03,904
Plus, with my discount,
we're saving a fortune.

10
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,141
How is spending a ton of
money on greeting cards

11
00:01:08,175 --> 00:01:09,309
Saving us a fortune?

12
00:01:09,343 --> 00:01:10,543
It's math.

13
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,045
It's really not.

14
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,179
Look it up.

15
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,918
$2.95, $2.95, $4.95...

16
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,987
40% off, 40% off,
40% off....$2.95, $3.95, $2.95.

17
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:23,790
Mitchell, I got this
golf buddy of mine.

18
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,192
Great guy. Super successful.
You two should talk.

19
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:27,661
It could mean a job for you.

20
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:29,129
Oh, thanks, dad, but I'm --

21
00:01:29,163 --> 00:01:30,997
I'm not really looking for
anything right now, but...

22
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:31,998
Yeah, that's right.

23
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,133
With me bringing home the bacon,

24
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:34,501
Mitchell doesn't have
to rush into anything.

25
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,369
Yeah, I know you have

26
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,938
All that greeting-card
screw-you money,

27
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,005
But talk to the guy?

28
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,507
He's expecting your
call in the morning.

29
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,841
Dad, I appreciate it,
but in the future --

30
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,143
Oh, I can't stand this.

31
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:44,377
I am sorry, but --

32
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:47,147
No. Those steaks have been
done for five minutes.

33
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,515
I'm taking them off the grill.

34
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:51,251
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,419
I-I know how it feels

36
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:54,154
To have him stick his nose
where it doesn't belong.

37
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,389
No biggie. That's
just Jay being Jay.

38
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,124
But one day I'm gonna
be a grandfather,

39
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,993
And then everybody
better hide their meat.

42
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:18,944
Ooh, who's she?

43
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,980
I hate it when you do that.

44
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:22,915
Who's he? It's charlie bingham.

45
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:24,516
He's the guy that my
dad wanted me to call.

46
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,218
I googled him. Look.

47
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:29,154
Oh, he owns earthgear apparel?
I have their ski pants.

48
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:30,923
Really? You don't - you don't ski.

49
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:33,959
I have cargo pants,
and I don't work at the docks.

50
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,361
God, I feel like such a slacker.

51
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:37,796
I mean, he has done so
much for being so young.

52
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,998
Okay, look, he's opened up

53
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,300
A dozen environmental
foundations and conservancies.

54
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:42,501
Wow.

55
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:44,336
So, are you gonna - are
you gonna call him?

56
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:47,673
I don't know. I mean, you know,
I-I sort of promised myself

57
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,675
And you that I'd take a
little time off and --

58
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:51,844
And you are loving your time off.

59
00:02:51,878 --> 00:02:52,978
Totally.

60
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:56,916
I am losing my mind.

61
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,550
As much as I love lily,

62
00:02:58,585 --> 00:03:01,553
Which is, you know,
more than life itself,

63
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:05,491
I am -- whew! -- Not cut out
to be a stay-at-home dad. No.

64
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:06,659
But I-it's cameron's turn.

65
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:08,661
It's cameron's turn
to be out in the world

66
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:11,463
Interacting with other grown-ups
while I get to stay at home

67
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:13,832
And plot the death
of dora the explorer.

68
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,736
I'd like to fill her
backpack with bricks

69
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,339
And throw her into
candy-cane river.

70
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,242
So, I don't know.
Should I -- should I call him?

71
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,044
I don't know. Maybe just to
get your dad off your back.

72
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:26,879
Yeah. You know, I mean --

73
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,581
I mean, because the last thing I want
for you is to take a job right now.

74
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:32,117
I am loving our life.

75
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,119
I am in a really dark space.

76
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:37,222
Being away from my lily
is literally torture.

77
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:38,958
and I can't pressure mitchell,

78
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:42,361
But I really, really,
really just want him to get a job

79
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:46,398
So I can go back to being a
stay-at-home dad/trophy wife!

80
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,603
Come on, ladies, move it!

81
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,506
Goodness gracious!
Turtles run faster!

82
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,908
Come on!

83
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:59,211
Could you run any slower?
I dare you to run slower.

84
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:01,246
You see? He's just
trying to light a fire.

85
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:03,015
<i>No, I light him on fire.</i>

86
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,517
Why do I always have to
come to these things?

87
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,519
Because you love your brother.

88
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:09,989
<i>Why don't you make him come to
my orchestra concerts?</i>

89
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:11,390
Because we love your brother.

90
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:12,424
Good job, luke!

91
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:16,996
Shoot!

92
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,465
Delgado! You're killing me, man!

93
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:22,234
I love you, manny, no matter what!

94
00:04:23,737 --> 00:04:25,471
Come on!

95
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:26,972
Okay.

96
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,308
That's great. Okay, well,
I'll let you know.

97
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:31,076
All right. All right, bye.

98
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:34,013
uh, so, charlie bingham
just invited us

99
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,115
Over to his beach house
for a little get-together.

100
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,517
Oh! Uh, well, what did you say?

101
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:40,085
I said I'd check with you.

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,854
I mean, what -- what do you think?

103
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:44,623
<i>What do you think?</i>

104
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:47,459
well, I think it would be
rude not to hear him out.

105
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,628
Yeah. I mean -- yeah,
you're probably right. Yeah.

106
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,896
Okay. Cool.

107
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,166
And don't worry. You know,
I'm not gonna take any job.

108
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,068
You better not.

109
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:01,306
I just miss - I just --

110
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:03,809
I just miss, you know...

111
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:10,049
I just -- make
grilled-cheese sandwiches.

112
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,352
You're doing great, luke,
if your goal is to suck.

113
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:14,420
Phil. I'm on it.

114
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,121
Wait for me.

115
00:05:16,856 --> 00:05:18,156
Hey, coach? Yeah.

116
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,724
Look, we appreciate your passion,

117
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,693
But some of us are
worried that the yelling

118
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,161
Is getting counter-productive.

119
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:25,063
I got this. Come on, stupid!

120
00:05:25,097 --> 00:05:26,097
No you don't "got this."

121
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:28,933
What you got is a bad attitude.

122
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,435
Who are you?

123
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,871
I happen to be the
stepfather of...

124
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:37,142
Doesn't matter who.

125
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:38,943
What you need to start doing

126
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:41,946
Is a little more coaching
and a little less yelling.

127
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:44,783
'cause if I hear you call one
of these kids stupid again,

128
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:47,352
I swear to god,
I'll throw a shoe at your head.

129
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,988
Screw it. I don't need this.

130
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,823
You think you can do a better job?

131
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:53,691
You coach.

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,061
Jay, you know,
I was handling this.

133
00:05:57,096 --> 00:05:59,297
I saw how you broke
out peaches and herb.

134
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,465
It's the captain and --

135
00:06:07,957 --> 00:06:09,391
Why? Is he sick?

136
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:10,826
Yes. He's very, very sick.

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,127
Is he going to die?

138
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,530
Everyone dies, boys,
let's focus on what's important.

139
00:06:14,564 --> 00:06:16,064
Our next game is in one hour.

140
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,167
We are going to go
from being five fingers

141
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:19,234
To being a fist.

142
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:20,302
How does that sound?

143
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,303
Great. Great.

144
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,372
I can't hear you? Great!  Great!

145
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:25,040
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

146
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,276
All right, gentlemen,
I talked to the referee. I'm coaching.

147
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,344
Oh, really? 'cause I --

148
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:30,612
Phil, I coached football.

149
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,247
Jay, I actually
coached basketball.

150
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,782
I think I can get these guys --

151
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,751
Relax, you've already
got the assistant job.

152
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:37,619
Now, think you can round
us up some waters?

153
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:40,255
Yeah.

154
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,390
Go ahead.

155
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,091
Gentlemen, this is what I need.

156
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,928
I want you to hit them,
and I want you to hit them hard.

157
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,696
Father-in-laws are tough,

158
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,531
Because you can't let
them push you around,

159
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,266
And you also have to
show them respect.

160
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,668
It's like walking a tightrope,

161
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:53,802
Which, by the way, I can do

162
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,304
Because I went to trapeze school.

163
00:06:55,338 --> 00:06:57,973
Did Jay? I doubt it.

164
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,241
Don't let them run over you.

165
00:06:59,275 --> 00:07:02,311
Honey, I'm gonna take off.
I'm gonna buy alex some clothes.

166
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:03,478
Okeydoke.

167
00:07:03,513 --> 00:07:05,080
How come you're not coaching?

168
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,349
'cause your dad coached football.

169
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:09,384
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,087
And I am going to make
it up to you tonight.

171
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,089
And I'll be thinking of
your dad while you do.

172
00:07:14,123 --> 00:07:16,825
Mm. Disturbing.

173
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:19,361
Hey, phil.

174
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:20,696
Hey. How's it going?

175
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,665
Great. Your dad coached football.

176
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,767
Ahh, a fellow victim.

177
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,202
Thank you again for
taking care of lily.

178
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:29,270
I know it's last-minute.

179
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:30,538
Ay, don't be silly.

180
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:32,039
We'll probably just stick
around for a few minutes.

181
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,975
You know how fussy she gets
when we pass her off, so --

182
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:35,243
No, she seems fine.

183
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,477
Yeah.

184
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:38,546
Ay, I think she's getting
used to being away from you

185
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,947
Now that you have the new job.

186
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:45,820
Mwah!

187
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:47,855
So proud of you!

188
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,490
We need to talk.

189
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:50,892
Okay. What happened?

190
00:07:50,926 --> 00:07:55,062
Mom, I love you,
but your words of encouragement

191
00:07:55,097 --> 00:07:58,199
Encourage the other
kids to make fun of me.

192
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:02,270
Okay, I won't say anything
else on the next game. Promise.

193
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:05,339
We both know that your latin
blood makes that impossible.

194
00:08:05,374 --> 00:08:06,741
I think it would be better

195
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,442
If you didn't come
to the next game.

196
00:08:22,457 --> 00:08:24,025
Ah! I know.

197
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,561
I hate our house. I know!

198
00:08:27,996 --> 00:08:29,530
And what's -- what's this thing?

199
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,399
I don't know, but it's fancy.

200
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,267
Stop -- stop playing
with it. Come on.

201
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,003
Just...Don't break it.

202
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:39,406
hey, mitchell!

203
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,407
Charlie bingham.

204
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,541
Nice to meet you. Hi!

205
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,477
This is my partner,
cameron tucker.

206
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,478
Pleasure. Cameron.

207
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:45,746
So we just went ahead and parked

208
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,014
On that round thingy
in the driveway.

209
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:48,415
Is that -- that's fine, right?

210
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,184
No problem. It's a turntable
so you don't have to back out.

211
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,552
Oh.

212
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:54,488
You have a car turntable
and you're wearing rubber.

213
00:08:54,522 --> 00:08:55,522
You're like batman.

214
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,024
I really am.

215
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,225
Come on in.

216
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,561
Turn the music down!

217
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:03,230
Wow.

218
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:05,332
Pardon the getup.

219
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,466
Killer waves today.

220
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,467
You guys surf?

221
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,036
Only for bargains on the web.

222
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,070
Everybody, say hi.

223
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:11,271
Hi. Hi. Hello!

224
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:13,807
That's jolie. She's head
of my europe division.

225
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:15,942
She cheats at poker. You do.

226
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,344
And that's my girlfriend, jenny.

227
00:09:17,378 --> 00:09:19,846
She makes a hell of a
margarita. Want one?

228
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,348
Absolutely. Oh, no, not -- o-okay.

229
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:24,551
Everybody, mitchell pritchett
and his partner, cameron.

230
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:27,521
Business partners.
Mergers and acquisitions.

231
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:28,922
I'm kidding. We're gay.

232
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:30,023
Stop talking.

233
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:31,591
When things are relaxed,

234
00:09:31,626 --> 00:09:33,260
I'm great in social situations.

235
00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:35,262
I would have fit in at the
algonquin round table.

236
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:38,932
But when the stakes are high,
I get a little tense.

237
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,134
I'd be the guy that would
knock over the round table.

238
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:42,702
Then dorothy parker
would make a quip,

239
00:09:42,737 --> 00:09:43,770
James thurber would laugh,

240
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:45,338
And then I would end
up leaving, crying.

241
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,875
How long you been
on the lam? What?

242
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,178
Honey, you are looking around
like the feds are after you.

243
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,714
No, I'm not. Let's just
get this over with.

244
00:09:54,748 --> 00:09:56,315
Oh! Great.

245
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,950
Oh, no. It's them.

246
00:09:59,152 --> 00:10:01,587
Oh! Oh, you know those
girls from school.

247
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:02,722
Hey!

248
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:03,923
Let's go. Over here.

249
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:05,124
What -- what is your problem?

250
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,192
nothing.

251
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,561
I'll meet you at
the car in an hour.

252
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:10,930
Please, mom. Please.

253
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,867
Hi, jenna.

254
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,006
And just like that,
my baby girl became a teenager.

255
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,407
She entered that dreaded phase

256
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,209
Where my very existence
embarrasses her.

257
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:25,845
I-I think I can help.

258
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,114
You're not your mom.

259
00:10:28,148 --> 00:10:30,750
<i>Wow, that's your mom.</i>

260
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:33,586
Oh, I just got chills.

261
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,823
So, first off, I'm a fan.

262
00:10:37,858 --> 00:10:39,992
I saw you in court once.

263
00:10:40,027 --> 00:10:41,627
seriously? Yeah.

264
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:43,462
Mayhew vs. Propyltech.

265
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:46,864
You are a good lawyer.

266
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:48,699
If you'd have handled my divorce,

267
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:50,868
This house would be twice as big.

268
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,003
Oh, he's better than good.

269
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:53,237
Try winning an argument with him.

270
00:10:53,272 --> 00:10:55,006
Last night, I wanted to
have indian for dinner --

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,541
And we're talking again.

272
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,776
Top of your class at
cornell and columbia law.

273
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,444
Had your pick of jobs

274
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,047
But instead chose to
work in environmental law

275
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:04,315
Until last month.

276
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:06,951
And he used to be a really
great figure skater.

277
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,352
Why'd you quit?

278
00:11:08,387 --> 00:11:10,121
His sister lost interest,
and then there was --

279
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:12,156
He means my job.

280
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,292
You can tell me about
figure skating, too.

281
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:16,661
Um, well, it was - she
did lose interest.

282
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:18,396
That's enough. Okay.

283
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,697
Iqué linda! Iay, qué linda!

284
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:21,832
Oh, my gosh! I didn't know
you guys were gonna be here.

285
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,833
Hola, claire.

286
00:11:22,868 --> 00:11:24,635
Mwah! Hi, lily. Mwah, mwah!

287
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,671
I had enough
basketball for one day.

288
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:28,739
Oh, I know. Come here, sweetie.

289
00:11:28,774 --> 00:11:30,641
Oh, sweet thing, you love me,

290
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,810
And you want me to
buy you a dress.

291
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:36,047
Ay, but I'm gonna buy
her some shoes first.

292
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:38,349
What's that, lily?
Do you want me to buy you a dress?

293
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,518
She said, "yes."

294
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,186
What?

295
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:47,358
She did not say, "yes."

296
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:48,826
Okay, "win" on 3.

297
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,595
1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3...

298
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:51,629
Win!    Win! Win! Win!

299
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,797
Don't forget the pick-and-roll.

300
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,231
These guys won't know
how to defend it.

301
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,633
Phil, try not to
confuse my boys, okay?

302
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,034
Okay. I sleep with your daughter.

303
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:58,235
What? Good luck.

304
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,104
All right, let's go, let's go,
come on, let's go!

305
00:12:00,172 --> 00:12:01,372
Get out there.

306
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,374
Hustle up! Get the tip!
Get the tip!

307
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:08,379
Oh! All right. Keep the hustle,
keep the hustle.

308
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,514
Come on, boys. Don't let
them push you around.

309
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:12,717
Oh! All right, little defense.

310
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:14,518
Play defense.

311
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:15,653
I did a little scouting,

312
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:17,555
And the other team
only has two shooters.

313
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,823
If we isolate both of them --

314
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:20,191
Good, phil, good. Thank you. Good.

315
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:22,593
Manny, pay attention!
What are you looking at?

316
00:12:22,628 --> 00:12:24,495
What?

317
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:25,496
Oh!

318
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,285
So, tell me this,

319
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,721
What are the regulatory
challenges of a solar farm?

320
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,390
well, you know,
it could be anything.

321
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,526
Agriculture, military,
protected species,

322
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,728
Ironically, even some
environmental groups.

323
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,296
I think you got all of it. Mm.

324
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,631
I think you got it.

325
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,766
Yeah, I'm just gonna
freshen this up.

326
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,768
Okay.

327
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:52,105
Let me ask you a question.
How do you like the beard?

328
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,007
I'm thinking of growing one.
Jenny's against it.

329
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,776
Oh, well, I've - I've
been very happy with mine.

330
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,879
That's it. I'm doing it.

331
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:02,115
Look, I've made a fortune.
I want to use it for some good.

332
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,617
I need a lawyer to
help me navigate.

333
00:13:04,652 --> 00:13:08,221
I like you. You get me.
So, in or out?

334
00:13:13,728 --> 00:13:14,794
I'm very sorry.

335
00:13:14,829 --> 00:13:16,329
It's okay.

336
00:13:16,364 --> 00:13:19,532
Um, that's a very big question.

337
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,735
You know, I'm obviously gonna
have to go talk to my, um...

338
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,169
... Bull in a china shop.

339
00:13:23,204 --> 00:13:25,004
I'll be right back. Sure.

340
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,006
Talk it over.
It's a major life decision.

341
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,143
Hey, jenny! The beard is on!

342
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:35,348
Okay, lily, it's time to
buy you beautiful shoes.

343
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,851
Oh, no, no, no. I saw another
really cute dress for her.

344
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,120
Ay, she has already
six new dresses.

345
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,889
What she needs is
strappy shoes. Oh.

346
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,023
Oh, oh. There's alex.

347
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:45,525
I'll -- I'll see you later.

348
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,327
Alex, honey. Hi.

349
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,664
Mom, I said I'd
meet you at the car.

350
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,969
Ugh.

351
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,170
Here.

352
00:13:58,205 --> 00:13:59,805
Thank you.

353
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,141
Still wish you had a daughter?

354
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,243
Manny didn't want me
at the game today.

355
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,212
oh, I'm sorry.

356
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,880
It's okay.

357
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,449
No, it's not okay. It sucks.

358
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,417
I miss babies.

359
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,219
They never tell you to go away.

360
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,788
Yeah. Or wait in the car.

361
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,089
I don't know about you,

362
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:19,091
But I'm not gonna stand here
and feel sorry for myself.

363
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,226
You know what we should do?

364
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,328
Get pregnant.

365
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,363
I was gonna say go for ice cream.

366
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,932
Okay, we'll do yours first.

367
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,268
Luke! Luke!

368
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:33,305
It's hard to guard a player
if there's no player near you!

369
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,740
We good in the hood?

370
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,376
This is a uniquely frustrating
group of boys. I hear ya.

371
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,577
Um, one thing that might help,

372
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,980
Instead of a zone, if you
switch to a simple man-to-man.

373
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,581
I got this. Really?

374
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:43,949
'cause according
to the scoreboard,

375
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,451
The only thing you
got is 4 points.

376
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,953
Good luck.

377
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:52,024
<i>I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to you.</i>

378
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,959
Nice top.

379
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,095
Come here. You -- you --

380
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,502
Cam. Cam, you have got to relax.

381
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:04,803
I told you I wouldn't
take a job --

382
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:06,238
Take the job. What?

383
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,806
I want you to take the job.

384
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:10,075
I thought you liked
having me home with lily.

385
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,011
I don't. I mean, I do.

386
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,446
I just -- I miss
my time with lily,

387
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,914
And I know it's selfish --

388
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,616
No, I want the job!

389
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,051
You do?

390
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,319
Oh, my god, yes!

391
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,322
I-I love lily,
but I hate baby talk.

392
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,324
I wuv baby talk!

393
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,594
Oh.

394
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,562
Let's go get this job.
Let's get this job.

395
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,364
okay.

396
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,699
Oh, no.

397
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,768
It's locked.

398
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:40,137
Guys? [ knocking on door ]

399
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:41,973
Oh, my gosh.
They not gonna hear us.

400
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,074
We're trapped out here.

401
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,976
That's -- stop being so dramatic.

402
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,677
We'll just go through the garage.

403
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,413
That's why he wants to hire you.
You're good in crisis.

404
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,216
What's that sound? I don't know.

405
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,192
It's not opening. Push it again.

406
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,593
I'm hearing things,
but it's not --

407
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,694
Push it harder.

408
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,464
That's not -- is it this one?

409
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,698
I hear something. What is that?

410
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,502
No. Stop touching. Stop --

411
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,343
This -- oh, that was it.
All right.

412
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:22,313
Mitchell! Oh, my god! No!

413
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:23,848
Oh, my god! No, cam!

414
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,516
Cam. Did we do that?

415
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:27,984
What are we gonna say?

416
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,185
Oh.

417
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,820
Oh.

418
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,623
I will take the job.

419
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,226
I kind of think you have to now.

420
00:16:39,797 --> 00:16:43,066
Guys, you're on the
same team! Time-out!

421
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,768
time-out.

422
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,603
Get over here.

423
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,373
Guys, earlier,
we practiced a few set plays.

424
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:52,942
Did any of them involve
wrestling the ball

425
00:16:52,977 --> 00:16:54,010
From your own teammate?

426
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:56,012
But you said to be
aggressive. Yeah.

427
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:57,280
Not on your own team!

428
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,415
Wait here.

429
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,185
You got to coach. I can't take it.

430
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:03,720
You talkin' to me? Yeah,
I'm talkin' to you.

431
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:05,655
You got to take over.
I'm about to lose it out there.

432
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,823
That sounds tough, coach.

433
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:08,957
What's your problem?

434
00:17:08,992 --> 00:17:10,959
Hey, coach. Tick tock.

435
00:17:10,994 --> 00:17:13,362
I was dealing with the coach,
you pushed me aside.

436
00:17:13,396 --> 00:17:15,297
I was dealing with the boys,
you pushed me aside.

437
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,300
Believe it or not, Jay, there are some
things that I am better at than you are.

438
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,301
Bam! It's out there!

439
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:20,636
Oh, for god's sake.

440
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,137
Coach!

441
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,338
He's calling you.

442
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,841
Listen, I don't blame you
for being angry. All right?

443
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,077
I'm used to taking charge.
That's all.

444
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,145
I should have let you
coach from the get-go.

445
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,280
And?

446
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:35,284
I love you.

447
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:36,819
No, the barbecue.

448
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,921
Oh, for god's sake.

449
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:42,591
I'm sure your steaks would've
been delicious and not chewy.

450
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:45,694
Okay. I'll do it.

451
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:46,795
Thanks.

452
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,297
And so the student
becomes the master.

453
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:50,099
The once mighty - you
know what? Forget it.

454
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,700
No, no, no, no. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm good.

455
00:17:51,735 --> 00:17:54,236
Hey, hey, guys. Who wants
to go out like a champ?

456
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,237
Yeah! Yeah!

457
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:56,305
I love it!

458
00:17:56,339 --> 00:17:58,273
Okay, jordie, you inbound to luke.

459
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:01,076
Manny, set a pick on luke's
man and roll to the bucket.

460
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,544
Luke, you know what to do.

461
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:03,779
No, I don't.

462
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,214
Bounce pass to manny.

463
00:18:05,248 --> 00:18:07,783
But dad -- coach --

464
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:10,185
Manny hasn't taken a
single shot all season.

465
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,087
Then chances are he'll be open.

466
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,089
okay, guys, let's bring it out.

467
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,457
Hey, hey. Bring it in.

468
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:16,925
Let's show these guys

469
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,460
What kind of team
they're about to beat.

470
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,062
Huh? "li'l dribblers" on 3.

471
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:21,263
1, 2, 3... 1, 2,
3...            1, 2, 3...

472
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:22,931
Li'l dribblers! Li'l dribblers!
Li'l dribblers!

473
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:25,734
Okay, red ball.
Side out. Here we go.

474
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:31,974
What's my coaching philosophy?

475
00:18:32,008 --> 00:18:34,109
Give a kid a bird...

476
00:18:34,144 --> 00:18:35,144
Yes.

477
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:37,179
...And he becomes one
of those weird dudes

478
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,314
Who walks around with a
bird on his shoulder.

479
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:41,083
But give him a pair of wings...

480
00:18:42,852 --> 00:18:45,721
...And he can fly...

481
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,022
Ohh!

482
00:18:48,456 --> 00:18:50,824
...Unless he has absolutely
no hand-eye coordination.

483
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,226
Okay.

484
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,794
I support you.

485
00:18:59,334 --> 00:19:00,668
Hey, mom.

486
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:01,769
That was 20 minutes.

487
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,637
mom.

488
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:06,774
I am so, so sorry.

489
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,676
I know it's no excuse,

490
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,213
But I've been feeling a lot
of pressure at school --

491
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,415
You know, with friends.

492
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:15,816
And I love you so much,

493
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,252
And I appreciate
everything you do for me.

494
00:19:19,588 --> 00:19:21,956
I'm still your little girl.

495
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:26,026
I know, honey.

496
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,828
That is so sweet.

497
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:29,230
Can I get $20?

498
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:31,198
A bunch of us are
going to a movie,

499
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,234
And we're gonna get
something to eat afterwards.

500
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:35,703
Jenna's brother's
gonna take us home.

501
00:19:35,737 --> 00:19:37,271
Okay! Of course.

502
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:38,706
Sweetie, you know what?

503
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,807
Take $40.

504
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:41,075
Oh, my gosh. Yeah!

505
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,409
That's right. Thanks, mom.

506
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:44,511
Go on. Have a great time.

507
00:19:46,915 --> 00:19:48,415
Oh, alex, honey.

508
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,217
When you're out shopping,

509
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:52,419
You might want to pick
yourself up a training bra.

510
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:53,754
I know you don't need one now,

511
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:55,923
But pretty your little boobies
are gonna come in soon.

512
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:58,926
Mommy loves you,
kitten! Mwah! Mwah!

513
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:03,998
Teach her to screw with me.

514
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:13,427
Luke passed to me, I shot the ball,
and I almost made it.

515
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:18,032
Ay, I bought lily the
cutest little dress today.

516
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,101
And then I stole the
ball from the other team,

517
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,704
Did a 360, and almost dunked it.

518
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:24,805
That's nice.

519
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:28,976
Ay, I just had the best
day today with lily.

520
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,811
That girl is so sweet.

521
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:34,081
I have a game next Saturday.
You could come.

522
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,149
No, it's okay.

523
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,217
I wouldn't want tembarrass you.

524
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,887
I'll probably take
lily out for cupcakes.

525
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:40,955
Mm-hmm.

526
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,856
Okay.

527
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:45,726
Any suggestions?

528
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,762
I usually go with earrings.

529
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:58,763
