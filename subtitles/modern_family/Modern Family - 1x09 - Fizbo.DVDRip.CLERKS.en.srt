Do we know anything?
No. They're in there now
with the doctor.

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,759
We're lucky though.
The paramedics said it
could have been a lot worse.

4
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,761
My God,
how did this even happen?

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,017
There he is.
Big day's coming up.

6
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,728
- What do you want
for your birthday, big dog?
- It's okay. I'm good.

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:24,608
Come on. Sky's the limit.
Dream big, my boy.

8
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:27,277
- Well, I guess
I could use a belt.
- A belt?

9
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,654
Yeah, you're right.
I don't need it.

[Exhales]

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,661
Every year, Luke's birthday falls
right around Thanksgiving,

13
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,247
and so it gets lost
in the holiday shuffle.

14
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:42,209
One year we forgot completely,
and we had to improvise
a cake of stuffing.

15
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,711
Which, by the way, he was fine with.
He's one of those kids,

16
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,672
you get him a gift
and all he wants to do
is play with the box.

17
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,675
Yeah, one year we actually
just got him a box,
a really nice box.

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,470
And we made the mistake
of putting it in a gift bag.

19
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,805
So he played
with the gift bag.

20
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,849
We can't get it right.
No.

21
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:00,560
- I feel terrible.
We gotta do something.
- Oh, yeah.

I am so with you.
We should blow this out...

25
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,653
and throw Luke
the best birthday party of all time.

26
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,655
Yes. Yes. And we'll order
a whole bunch of pizzas...

27
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,657
and set up
an arts and crafts table.

28
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,659
- A what?
- A crafts table.

29
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,995
You know, where everybody
gathers around and they
make stuff, and then bam!

getting a clown for today?

I'd say most people.

You know what?
We haven't gotten Luke
a present yet.

This is not our party.

Fine. What would you suggest
we get him then, hmm?

how to wrap one of these things?

Is that a crossbow?
Yeah. Am I the greatest grandpa
in the world or what?

We can't give Luke a crossbow.

00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,671
He pokes himself in the eye...

62

every time he uses a straw.

63
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,342
Are you kidding?
I had one when I was his age.

64
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,635
My dad used to give me a quarter
for every crow I bagged.

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,347
And I used to have a machete.
But times have changed.

It'll be fine.
I'll teach him how to use it.

Am I charming?

- Of course you're charming.

you don't usually come
to me for advice.

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,667
I've tried everything
to get her attention-

77
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,545
opening doors, having a milk
sent over in the cafeteria.

78
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,589
Nothing's worked.
Here's the deal.

Girls don't go
for all that romantic stuff.

And since you don't have
either one of those things,
you're gonna be the funny guy.

reptile you've got.

I have an iguana
that eats crickets.

84
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,982
That'd be scary
if it was a birthday party
for crickets.

Seriously, Jungle Tanya,
I need you step it up a notch.

Is there anything
that scares the cocoa
out of you?

87
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:01,658
Uh, not really.
I do have a bearded dragon.

88
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,619
Ooh. Does it-
No, it does not breathe fire.

89
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,788
Well, then we're back
to square one, aren't we?

out of my mind.

00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,379
I know I made
a promise to Mitchell,

93
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,841
but some things
are bigger than promises.

94
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:22,011

I keep thinking there was
something I could've done.

98
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,988
No, don't blame yourself.
Who could've possibly
seen it coming?

ever gotten hurt
on one of these things?

102

I don't know, man.
It's my first day.
See?

103
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,167
They wouldn't let
the new guy do it if it-

104
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:54,127
That did not make me
feel better.
Don't worry.

105
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,212
I signed, like,
a hundred releases.

106
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,674
When did we decide all this?
I think it's too much.

107
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,968
See, I knew you'd say that.
That's why I didn't tell you.

00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:03,970
So just relax.
Grab a snow cone.

109

- There's a snow cone machine?
- Yeah.

Dylan cannot have mayonnaise.

111

That's random.
Why are you
telling me that?

00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,980
'Cause he's coming
to the party.
Is that absolutely necessary?

113
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,233
Yes, because she can't
go 10 minutes without her
boyfriend's tongue in her mouth.

114
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,653
It's like he's feeding
a baby bird.
Don't be so jealous.

115

I'm sure you'll meet someone
super hot at computer camp.

Hey. Hey.

117

- Oh. These are supplies
for the crafts table.

118
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:30,079
I finally figured out
what we're gonna be making.

119
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:33,124
Kids bored? [Chuckles]
I'm teasing. I'm teasing.

120
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,503
It looks good.
What is it?
Comb sheaths.

121
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,505
I know. I know.

122
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:41,591
But we made them
when I was 11 years old
at Donna Rigby's birthday party.

123
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,469
At first we thought
it was really stupid,
and then we had a blast, so-

124
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:48,097
How could you not?
You combined the two things
that kids love the most-

125
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,350
combs and sheaths.

126
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,852
I'm kidding!

127
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:54,854
Where's my comb? Oh!

128
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,525
Here it is
in my incredibly convenient
beaded comb sheath...

129
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,152
that I made at Luke's
awesome birthday party.

130
00:06:01,237 --> 00:06:03,196
Hole in one, Mrs. Dunphy.

131
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,448
Hole in one.

132
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:07,492
I'm home.

133
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,036
I got Luke a video game,
but it's about math.

134
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,289
So I guess
we're those kind of uncles.

135
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,417
Cam.

136
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,090
Don't be mad.

137
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,884
Oh. Cam. Uh-

138
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,803
I've known I wanted
to be a clown...

139
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,888
since I found out clowns
were just people
with makeup.

140
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:31,683
Um, as a matter of fact,
by the time I was a teenager,

141
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,852
if I wasn't in school or fishin',
I was clownin'.

142
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,854
There are four types
of clowns-

143
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,899
a tramp, an Auguste,
a whiteface and a character.

144
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,361
I am a classically trained
Auguste clown named Fizbo.

145
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,530
What?
N-Nothing.

146
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,532
Between the clownin'
and the fishin',

147
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,784
I'm surprised you had time
for the schoolin'.

148
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:53,496
Aw, and there's the fifth type-

We did.
But I- I started thinking.

This is about a little boy

And he's gonna get that
from his weird gay

for your comb.

297
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,585
Oh. That's Dylan.
He's Haley's boyfriend.

298
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,920
He's so cute and tall.

299
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,174
I'm still growing.
Give me a break.

300
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,762
Pardon me, miss,
but this little doggy
needs a new home.

301
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:49,847
Oh, thank you.
[Chuckles]

302
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,768
That's quite
an impressive getup
you got there.

303
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:57,396
Thank you, Jay.
Oh, by the way, you have
something on your shoulder.

304
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,649
[Laughing]
That's good.

305
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,902
Never mind.
It was nothing.

306
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,987
We're done here.

307
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,368
[Woman]
Oh, that's nice.

308
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:13,954
[Balloon Pops]

309
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,874
So, do you keep these
at a zoo or something?

310
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,335
[Tanya] No. I just
keep 'em at my place.
That's awesome.

311
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:24,090
I only have a cat.
Yeah?
I used to have a cat.

312
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,925
I was just messing
with you before,

313
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:29,011
but seriously,
he's still talking to her.

314
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,806
- Wow. Cool.
- On it.

315
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,517
- [Tanya] You know, this is one of-
- I feel like Britney Spears.

316
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,602
[Laughs]
You're so funny.

317
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,271
You kind of do look
like Britney Spears.

318
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:41,649
[Dylan]
Really?
I'm just kidding.

319
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,985
- Anyway, this is
probably my favorite.
- Hey, jungle lady?

320
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,115
- I think- I think
one of your bugs got out.
- What? This one?

321
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,283
This box thing here-
It's on its side.

322
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,619
- Oh, my God. Where did it go?
- Is everything okay?

323
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,664
No. I lost a poisonous scorpion,
and I need to find it.

324
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:00,459
Okay, kids, let's all tuck
our pants into our socks.

325
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:04,713
Avoid shady, moist places,
and let's make a game
of looking where we step.

326
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,848
Is he okay?
Can we see him?

327
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,017
He's in with the doctor
right now.

328
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,146
These things happen, right?
No matter how careful you are.

329
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,232
Hey, look what Grandpa
gave me- a crossbow.

330
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,276
Sweetie, that
does not look safe.
Don't worry.

331
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,696
He's gonna show me
how to use it.
That's what... I'm afraid of.

332
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,781
[Jay]
Come on. Ready?

333
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,994
Oh, my God.
You are not making
comb sheaths.

334
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,663
I am, and I know.
It's really lame.
Everybody hates it.

335
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,790
No. It's just like, uh,
Donna Rigby's party.

336
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:43,002
Exactly! Yes!
And I have the beads
and everything.

337
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,504
Amazing.
This is awesome.

338
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,174
So... Cam's a clown.

339
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,259
[Phil]
I got you.
Yeah.

340
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:53,554
I totally got you.
[Claire]
And there's mine.

341
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,806
You think it's weird
that we both chose
people who were so-

342
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,143
Uninhibited?
I was gonna say
"embarrassing," but yeah.

343
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,646
Look at them now.
They're the life of the party.

344
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,649
Uh, you know, I gotta say,
for all his craziness,

345
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,610
I love my clown.

346
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,196
Me too.
They're good for us.

347
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,364
I would've totally
tanked this party.

348
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,117
And I would've gotten
my butt kicked at a gas station.

349
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:19,038
Sorry?
Turns out Fizbo
is a real bad-ass.

350
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,208
- [Screaming]
Scorpion! Scorpion! Scorpion!
- [Children Screaming]

351
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:25,211
Scorpion!
[Screaming Continues]

352
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:30,382
No, no. Too close.
Too close. Too close.

353
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,051
- What the hell? Oh!
- [Crossbow Fires]

354
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,136
[Air Hissing]
Oh, crap!

355
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,680
[Claire]
Calm down. What happened?
We fired the crossbow.

356
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:40,476
No, I know. Oh, my God.
It's right there.
[Kids Screaming]

357
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,440
Bianca, I'm coming.

358
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:50,486
[Claire]
Who else is
in there? Get out!

359
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,364
[Yelling]

360
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:57,159
It turns out
I'm not the sweet guy
or the funny guy.

361
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,620
No, Manny, don't go in!
¡Por favor!

362
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,664
I must!

363
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,253
I'm coming!

364
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,964
Manny Delgado
is a man of action.

365
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,845
Wait. My dog
is still in there.

366
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:21,016
I'll be right back.
[Grunts]

367
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:32,111
[Luke]
Ow! My arm!

368
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,071
Sweetie? Luke?

369
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,282
What happened, buddy?
What happened?
What happened, honey?

370
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,033
Hey, hey.
What happened?

371
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,412
- I slipped on these stupid beads.
- Oops.

372
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:43,038
Come on.
Here we go.
Ow!

373
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,208
How is he?

374
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,043
Oh, he's gonna be fine.
Ay, Dios mío.

375
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,962
[Jay] Hi, honey.
How are you, kid?

376
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,465
[Claire]
Oh, there he is.
[Gloria] Pobrecito.

377
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,968
[Haley]
You poor thing.

378
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,761
Wow. Everybody's here.

379
00:18:57,846 --> 00:18:59,847
Of course we are.
How's that busted flipper?

380
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:03,350
Okay.
Sorry about today, buddy.
We'll try again next year, huh?

381
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:05,894
Are you kidding? This was
the best birthday ever.

382
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:08,605
What?
I got a cast.

383
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,358
You like a cast?
I've always wanted one.

384
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,278
After a few weeks,
they start to smell.
[Gloria] Ew!

385
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,280
You are so weird,
you know that?

386
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,906
Can I sign it?
Sure.

387
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,075
Hey. Me first.
Here.

388
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,744
[Phil]
If you'd asked me
before the party...

389
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,663
if I wanted there to be
a chain reaction of disasters...

390
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:28,083
that led to Luke breaking his arm,
I probably would've said no.

391
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,880
Probably?
Prob- Definite- Definitely
not. Would not want that.

392
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,050
But, one way or another,

393
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:40,387
Luke was the center of attention
on his birthday, and the whole family
was together...

394
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,932
just the way it should be.

395
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:47,186
Fizbo delivery!
I brought the cake!

396
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,146
[Gloria]
Bravo!

397
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:52,107
[Mitchell]
Wow.
I can't do this.

398
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,151
[Inhales]
Oh, God. I'm out.

399
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,238
[Breathing Heavily]

400
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,659
Cake.
[All Chattering]

401
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:06,246
[Gloria]
Blow the candles.
Blow the candles.

402
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:13,170
Bianca Douglas called me
three times tonight.

403
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:16,507
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I'm starting to feel smothered.

404
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,761
I really like my cast,
but it's starting to itch.

405
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,098
Good thing my mom made me
this personal scratcher.

406
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,017
Oh, that's good stuff.

407
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,728
If another woman
is messing with your man,

408
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,814
you have to get proactive.

409
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:36,068
I don't care how pretty she is
or how many stupid reptiles she has.

410
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,821
She tries to take what's mine,

411
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,073
girlfriend's gonna get stung.

412
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,869
