00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,690
Hmm.

149
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:26,237
- Shotgun, sucka!
- [Jay Laughing]

150
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:28,698
Yeah. That's good.

151
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,492
I'm gonna see the sights.

152
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,121
Not if they see you first!

153
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,707
Kind of missed
with that one, kid.

154
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,752
All right.

155
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,921
This is all you
need to know right here.

156
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,050
Apparently, the pencil's
in two pieces, and they glue 'em
together on the lead.

157
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,969
What if we put all the stuff
about his life on this side...

158
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:52,555
and all the stuff
about his paintings
on this side?

159
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,515
Luke, buddy,
that's fantastic!

160
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,809
And the best part is,
you came up with that
by yourself.

161
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,102
[Rattling]

162
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,481
All it took was a little
bit of focus and, uh-

163
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:05,109
This thing is really loose.
I'm gonna go grab a screwdriver.

164
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:08,488
But you run with this.
On your mark, get set,
van Gogh.

165
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,490
[Door Opens]
Hey, Dad.

166
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,743
He kind of looks like Uncle Mitchell,
if Uncle Mitchell were insane.

167
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,995
- [Chuckles]
- [Door Closes]

168
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,956
[Screaming]
I got sprayed by a skunk!

169
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,085
Oh!
[Whimpering]
Oh, you stink!

170
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,504
And not just at astronomy!
Blammo!

171
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,589
[Groans]
What is happening?

172
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,803
[Woman]
¿Qué pasó?

173
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,889
I love this place.

174
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,350
I was a little bit worried
because it's not exactly-

175
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,520
I... love... this place.
[Chuckles]

176
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,772
I... was... nervous.

177
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,483
I mean, there was
a lot of different food
on the menu,

178
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,527
and on the floor,
and on the wall.

179
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:50,238
Uh- Are we- Are we sure
we're not exaggerating
just a little bit?

180
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,989
Were you there, Mitchell?

181
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:55,326
Because I think I would
have recognized the only
other white or gay person.

182
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,996
I'd already offended Gloria once.
Not gonna do it again.

183
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,582
Hola. ¿Cómo está?
¡Gloria!

184
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,710
¿Cómo estás?
¿Cómo estás? Ya tienes mucho
que no vienes, ¿eh?

185
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,670
- Mi amigo Cameron.
- Ah, welcome.

186
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,339
So, carnitas diablos.
Ah, you remember.

187
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:11,509
- Claro.
- Um, I'll just have the same thing.

188
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,178
No, no, no.
You should have
the chicken enchiladas.

189
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,306
Mm-hmm.
No, I'll have the carnitas diablos.

190
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,434
- These are not for you.
- Excuse me?

191
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,645
- They're too spicy.
Miss Gloria's used to it.
- Yeah, he's right.

192
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,899
I can spice you
under the table any day
there, sweet thing.

193
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,403
Dos carnitas diablos,
por favor.

194
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,071
Okay.

195
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,031
Okay.
[Giggling]

196
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:36,242
[Clears Throat]

197
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,912
- Mitchell!
- Of course. What was I thinking?

198
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,498
[Sighs]
Dad, can we- can we
just go home, please?

199
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,711
You've got to air out first
before I let you in that car.
I'll never get the stink out.

200
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,213
Hey, Jay, is that Venus?

201
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,091
'Cause I can smell the clouds
of pure sulfuric acid from here.

202
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,595
- Slam!
- Okay. I-I'd really like
to go home now.

203
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,389
We'll miss the meteor shower.
The trouble is your clothes.

204
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,476
Just take them off.
I think there's a blanket
in the trunk.

205
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,853
You sure, Dad?
You're not worried I might
stink up the blanket?

206
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,855
Don't worry about it.

207
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,609
We just use it to cover up
the seat for when Manny's all
sweaty after his tango class.

208
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,236
If you don't sweat,
you're not doing it right.

209
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,367
[Laughing]

210
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,120
He was one of the best
boyfriends I ever had.

211
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,706
But he was gay.
Yeah.

212
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,958
I figured that out
after the first month-
[Coughs]

213
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,294
And I stayed for a whole year
because the haircuts
were fantastic!

214
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,380
[Laughing, Crying]
It's funny, huh?

215
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,133
[Hysterical Laughing]
Cameron, that one
is not that funny.

216
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:35,676
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

217
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,054
Are you sure?
I love this place.

218
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,848
[Coughing]
But your head
is running water.

219
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,725
No, I don't think it is.

220
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,895
I told you
it was too spicy for you.
Look at your shirt.

221
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,523
I just need to get a bit
of a drink of something.
No, no, no!

222
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:51,567
Cameron, the water
makes it so worse. No!
Excuse me. Excuse me.

223
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,154
Oh, you're right.
That does make it worse.

224
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,490
Oh- I feel like
I ate the sun!

225
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:02,537
And that is the secret
to no lumps. See?
It's kind of fun.

226
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,497
- You make it fun, Mom.
- Mmm.

227
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,333
Listen to these symptoms of A.D.H.D.
And tell me it's not Luke.

228
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,045
Alex!
"Easily distracted
by irrelevant stimuli."

229
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,175
[Electrical Buzzing]

230
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:25,059
"Often impulsively abandons
one task for another."

231
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,984
That's where I left those.

232
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,945
"A tendency to act
without regard to consequences,

233
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,657
often at the expense
of personal safety."

234
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,501
[Grunts]

235
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,970
- "Having accidents more often"-
- I think that's enough, Alex.
We've got it.

236
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,821
Oh, no. No!

237
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,449
[Clattering]

238
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,575
[Exhales]

239
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,994
Phil. Phil!
Honey, are you okay?

240
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,789
Yeah.
Remember those sunglasses
I couldn't find?

241
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,125
Bingo!
[Chuckles]

242
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:34,003
I asked you to do one thing-
stay on top of Luke.

243
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,089
For your information,
your son is hard at work
on an awesome van Gogh-

244
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,091
Gotta fix that- masterpiece.

245
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,427
Wait'll you see.
You're gonna be so surprised.

246
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:45,222
Oh, God, honey.
I want nothing more than
to be surprised, really.

247
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,519
Oh.

248
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,605
I'm not surprised.

249
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,361
Okay, that's it.
I don't want to hear anything about
your new method of doing things.

250
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,656
There's one thing that works
with these kids, and that is
staying on top of them,

251
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,160
which, thanks to you, my friend,
I will now be able to do all night long.

252
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,879
- Not happy, dude.
You're supposed to be working.
- I am working.

253
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,298
- Mr. Potato Head, really?
- I know what you think, but-

254
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,968
No, I don't wanna hear it.
I'm going down
to clean up the garage,

255
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,721
then I'm coming back
and I'm gonna stand over you
until this thing is done, okay?

256
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,064
Breathe.
Breathing only makes
the fire spread.

257
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,816
Okay. Then drink this milk.

258
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,778
Ay, Cam.
Why did you have to order
that spicy dish?

259
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,989
Because I'm, um, a big idiot...

260
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,784
and I wanted to have
this awesome night
between the two of us...

261
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:51,414
where we end up best friends,
uh, having lunch, buying shoes.

262
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,501
Okay! Let's go have lunch,
let's go buy shoes.

263
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,504
Really?
Yeah. Why are you so surprised?

264
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:02,633
Well, I don't know.
I guess I just always feel
like I blow it with you...

265
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,844
whether it's
the Columbian comment...

266
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,887
or picking
the wrong restaurant.

267
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,558
The restaurant
had nothing to do with you.

268
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,644
I was just not in the mood
to go anywhere that fancy...

269
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,856
after the stupid thing
I did this morning.

270
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,400
What did you do?

271
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,486
I bought a dress.
You monster.

272
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,531
Ay. It was
a very expensive dress
that I don't need.

273
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,867
I felt so stupid
that when I got home,

274
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,119
I couldn't even bring it
inside the house.

275
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,371
I left it in the car.
I totally get it.

276
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,373
I have a legendary hat story.

277
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,584
I'll bet you look fabulous
in that dress.

278
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,837
Yes, but anyone would look
fabulous in that dress.
[Chuckling]

279
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,591
You find that blanket?
No.

280
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,093
This was all I could find.
Shut up!

281
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,888
- Really shows off your shape.
- Okay.

282
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,348
Spin around, cupcake.
Let's see the caboose!

283
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,519
You get fries
with that shake?
[Wheezing Laugh]

284
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,439
Was that too far?
There's a line, Jay.

285
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,816
I better go mop this up.

286
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,278
Oh, come on.
Where's the-

287
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,073
[Clears Throat]

288
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,826
I'm sorry if things
got a little out of hand
back there,

289
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,912
but in our defense,
look at you.

290
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,955
[Chuckling]
I mean, smell you.

291
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,124
[Mock Laughing]
This is a fantastic apology.

292
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,461
Oh, don't be
too hard on the kid.
I was egging him on.

293
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:24,965
You're gonna be mad,
be mad at me.
Done!

294
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,510
I was just happy to see him
laugh a little bit.

295
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,595
You know, he's had
kind of a tough week.

296
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,933
I got sprayed by a skunk,
and I'm wearing a dress that
makes my hips look huge.

297
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,727
I know he doesn't want me
to talk about it,

298
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:39,688
but he didn't get invited
to this big party.

299
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,775
Some kids he thought were
his friends think he's weird.

300
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,071
Now, you know me on this.
I'm no- I'm no good at it.

301
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,491
You know, I- I never
know what to say.
That's true.

302
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,869
But maybe I raised a kid
who would know what to say.

303
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,665
That's the only reason
I invited him along-

304
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,210
you know, because
this astronomy stuff,
that's- that's our thing.

305
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,212
[Chuckles]

306
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,423
Yeah.
No, I'll talk to him.

307
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,634
You know, you don't look
that ridiculous.

308
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,928
Now, you actually
got the legs for it.
Dad.

309
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:13,639
No, I'm just saying,
if you were that type of a gay-
Dad!

310
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,724
You'd probably do
all right for yourself.

311
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,726
Come on!

312
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,814
You know, I always had a sense
it was dangerous down here,

313
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,441
but I guess it's actually
kind of charming, isn't it?

314
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:27,444
No, it's not safe at all.
[Siren Wailing In Distance]

315
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:30,489
I used to live
down here, you know.
What?

316
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:33,367
Yeah, that's why
I come down here.
Look there.

317
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,369
That was my old apartment.

318
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,247
After I left Javier,
that's all I could afford.

319
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,291
It's still part of me.
Mmm.

320
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,086
You have to remember
those things, like you
when you go to your farm.

321
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,422
You remember that?
I told you that a year ago.

322
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,967
Of course I do.
You're my friend,
you big idiot.

323
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,846
[Laughing]
You know, this part of town
might be very rough,

324
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,765
but the people here,
Cameron- the best.

325
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,895
I'm pretty sure I had wheels
when I parked here.

326
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,938
¡Ayayay!
Who did this?

327
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,941
No, it's okay, Gloria.
[Shouting]
Who did this?

328
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,862
You coward son of bitches!
It's okay, everybody!
I'm- I'm insured!

329
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,658
What? What? You scared?
You scared to show your face,
little girl?

330
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,453
No, it's all right, everybody!
Cameron, wait in the car!

331
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,705
Gloria, I think it's drivable.
Cameron!

332
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,207
Gloria!

333
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,921
Just so you know, I'm going
back up to Luke's room, and I'm
not leaving until he's finished.

334
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,925
Thank you.
And I'm really sorry for not
underestimating Luke enough.

335
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,469
Well, that means a lot to me.

336
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,055
The hardest part is,
he kinda takes after me
with all this.

337
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,474
Hmm.
Like my lack of focus
and your-

338
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,601
My what?
I just love you.

339
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,524
I did it.
[Phil]
Hey.

340
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:49,485
Oh, my God.

341
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,030
- Do you like it?
- I-I- I love it.

342
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,157
Did you do this?
All him.

343
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:58,744
I used Mr. Potato Head ears
because van Gogh
cut his ear off.

344
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:02,331
And there's money
because his paintings sell for,
like, a bajillion dollars,

345
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,042
which is sad
because he died broke.

346
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,253
Yes. That-

347
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,588
[Whispers]
You were right.
Don't apologize.

348
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,675
I'm not apologizing.
Apology accepted.

349
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,469
Luke, I-I really couldn't
be more proud of you,

350
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,013
and I am so sorry I didn't
give you more credit.

351
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,140
Thanks.
[Phil]
Way to go, buddy.

352
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,937
[Clicks Tongue]
Gotta go finish the cupcakes.

353
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,648
[Chuckling]
No. She didn't.

354
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,359
- Sweetie, can you hand me those?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,987
Yeah, I can talk.

356
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,405
What are you doing?

357
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:37,533
I showed you how to make 'em,
and now you can do it yourself.

358
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,661
Come on, guys. Let's go.

359
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:45,124
Well, good, because
I really wanted to.

360
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,085
Okay. I'm setting
the oven to 700!

361
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,797
I'm putting, uh- I'm putting
the eggs in the bowl!

362
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:54,425
Oh, I got some shells
in 'em! Uh-oh!

363
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,387
Are you serious?
[Exhales]

364
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,976
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Mitchell.

365
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,395
So, I know you'd never, um-

366
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,608
I know you'd never, never believe this
by looking at me right now,

367
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,528
but, um, I used to
get picked on at school too.

368
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,323
So Jay told you?
Yeah.

369
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:19,950
Yeah, they would, um-
they'd call me weird.

370
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,578
I was weird.
Uh, fun weird.

371
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,205
But I- This is the funny thing
about growing up.

372
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,708
For years and years,
everybody's desperately afraid...

373
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,711
to be different,
you know, in any way.

374
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:34,089
And then, suddenly,
almost overnight,

375
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,717
everybody wants to be different,

376
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:40,554
and that is where we win.

377
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,724
I'm sort of counting on that.
Yeah.

378
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,226
I'm sorry I was
picking on you too much.
Ah, that's-

379
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,771
Jay said that's
what brothers do.
[Chuckles]

380
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,940
Well, we don't have to listen to him.
Brothers do that too.

381
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,485
Okay, ladies.
Finish up your tea party.

382
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,070
You're missing the show.

383
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,864
Can't believe I was fighting
over this guy, huh?

384
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,742
Check it out. Check it out.
Oh. Whoa.

385
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,661
Wow.
Awesome!

386
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,335
[Luke]
Why did he paint
The Starry Night?

387
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:17,007
Maybe because the sky is beautiful,
and everybody likes looking at it,

388
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:23,680
and it reminds us
that something's up there
watching over all of us-

389
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,518
aliens, who could be here
in a second...

390
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,603
to liquefy us
and use us as fuel.

391
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:32,272
So wake up, people.
We're next.

392
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,274
Mom!

393
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,318
You better get down here!

394
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,283
Mmm!
Oh, my God.

395
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,911
Wow! Delicious!
Uh-huh.

396
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,914
- I am so proud.
- Oh! Thanks, Mom.
I'm just gonna wrap these up.

397
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,458
No. You know what, sweetie?
You're gonna be late for school.
Just go.

398
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,419
- I'll bring 'em by later.
- Are you sure?

399
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,587
Yeah! Get out of here,
Betty Crocker.
Okay.

400
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,589
I'm so proud of you!

401
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,591
[Gagging, Spits]

402
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,677
Do we still have the number
for Poison Control?

403
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,054
I love you, Claire.
I'll always love you!

404
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,931
My mouth is asleep,
like at the dentist.

405
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,016
Get over here, buddy.

406
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,520
