1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,700
Here we go.
Pad thai, no peanuts.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,100
But does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,200
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,300
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,100
- Are there any chopsticks.
- No need. This is Thai food.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,400
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
Thailand has had the fork since
the latter half of the 19th Century.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,800
Interestingly  they don't put the fork
in their mouth--

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,900
they use it to put the food on a spoon
which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,200
Ask him for a napkin.
I dare you.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
I'll get it.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,600
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

15
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,500
- Am I interrupting?
- No. You're not swelling, Howard.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,300
Look at my fingers.
They're like Vienna sausages.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,800
So, you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,600
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
People order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,600
So you kind of act like
a carbohydrate delivery system.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah. Call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,400
I was wondering if you could help me out

24
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,800
- with something.
- Yes.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
Great. I'm having some furniture

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,600
delivered tomorrow
and I may not be here, so...

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello.

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,300
- I'm sorry?
- Haven't you ever been told

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,200
how beautiful you are
in flawless Russian?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, I haven't.

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Get used to it.

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,900
Yeah. I probably won't.

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,000
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

34
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,300
Hey, Raj.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,000
Still not talking to me, huh?

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,600
He can't talk to women.

38
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,000
It can't talk to atractive woman,
or in your case,

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
a cheesecake- scented goddess.

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,900
So there's gonna be
some furniture delivered?

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,200
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,000
and have them put it in my apartment?

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
No problem.

44
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,100
Great. Here's my spare key.
Thank you.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Penny, wait.

46
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,600
If you don't have any other plans,
do you want to join us

47
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,900
for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

48
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
A marathon?
How many Superman movies are there?

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,900
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,900
I do like the one where Lois Lane
falls from the helicopter

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,600
and Superman swooshes down
and catches her. Which one was that?

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
One.

53
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
You realize that scene
was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

54
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,100
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
No.
Let's assume that they can.

56
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,800
Lois Lane is falling,

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,600
accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second per second.

58
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
Miss Lane, who is now traveling

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,400
at approximately 120 miles an hour,

61
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,200
hits them and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,000
Unless Superman matches
her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,500
In what space, sir?
She's two feet above the ground.

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,800
Frankly, if he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
It'd be a more merciful death.

66
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption

67
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,600
that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

68
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,900
Are you listening  to yourself?
It is well established

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,600
that his flight is a feat of strength.

70
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,000
It is an extension of his
ability to leap tall buildings,

71
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,600
an ability he derives from
exposure to Earth's yellow sun.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,400
And how does he fly at night?

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,900
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,600
and the energy-storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm just gonna go wash up.

76
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I have 2,600 comic books in there.
I challenge you

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,700
to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

78
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,200
Challenge accepted.

79
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,300
We're locked out.

80
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,600

Season 1 Episode 2:
The Big Bran Hypothesis

1
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Her apartment's on the fourth floor
but the elevator's broken, so...

2
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,500
You're just gonna be done?
Okay. Cool. Thanks

3
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,600
We'll just bring it up ourselves.

4
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,200
I hardly think so.

5
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
Why not?

6
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,700
Well, we don't have a dolly,

7
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,300
or lifting belts
or any measurable upper-body strength.

8
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
We don't need strength--
we're physicists.

9
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,300
We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes.

10
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,700
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

11
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
It's just a matter of...
I don't have this.

12
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,200
Archimedes would be so proud.

13
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,600
Do you have any ideas?

14
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,900
Yes, but they all involve
a green lantern and a power ring.

15
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,300
Easy... easy.

16
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,300
Now we've got an inclined plane.
The force required to lift

17
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
is reduced by the sine
of the angle of the stairs,

18
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,300
call it 30 degrees, so, about half.

19
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,000
Exactly half.

20
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Exactly half.

21
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's push.

22
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,900
See, it's moving, this is easy.

23
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,800
It's all in the math.

24
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,200
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

25
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,800
Okay, no problem.

26
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Just come up here,
help me pull and turn.

27
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,200
Ah, gravity,
thou art a heartless bitch.

28
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,100
You do understand that our efforts here
will in no way increase the odds

29
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,200
of you having sexual congress
with this woman.

30
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

31
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,200
Those would be men who just had sex.

32
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm doing this
to be a good neighbor.

33
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

34
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Almost there.

35
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Almost there.

36
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
- Almost there.
- No, we're not.

37
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,800
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're not!

38
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,100
Watch your fingers.

39
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,800
Oh, God, my fingers!

40
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,900
- You okay?
- No, her...

41
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,800
Great Caesar's ghost,
look at this place.

42
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
So Penny's a little messy.

43
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
A little messy?

44
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,600
The Mandelbrot set of complex
numbers is a little messy.

45
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,800
This is chaos.

46
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Excuse me.

47
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,700
Explain to me
an organizational system

48
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.

49
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm just inferring this is a couch

50
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,700
because the evidence suggests
the coffee table

51
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
is having a tiny garage sale.

52
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did it ever occur to you
that not everyone has

53
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,400
the compulsive need to sort,
organize and label

54
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,900
the entire world around them?

55
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
No.

56
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Well, they don't.

57
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Hard as it may be for you to believe,

58
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,900
most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

59
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,100
Excuse me, but I think we've both
found that helpful at times.

60
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

61
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

62
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,900
This is not your home.

63
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,600
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

64
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,900
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

65
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,600
Because it was immaculate.

66
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,800
I mean, you opened
that man's closet,

67
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,600
it was left to right evening gowns,

68
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,000
cocktail dresses,
then his police uniforms.

69
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
What were you doing in his closet?

70
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,300
I helped him run
some cable for a web cam.

71
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,600
This just arrived,
we just brought this up... just now.

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Great.
Was it hard getting it up the stairs?

73
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,500
- No.
- "No"?

74
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
No.

75
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
No.

76
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,900
Well, we'll get out of your hair.

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Okay, great.
Thank you again.

78
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

79
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm here for you.

80
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,300
What's he talking about?

81
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

82
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,900
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

83
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,700
Penny's sleeping.

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,300
Are you insane?

85
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
You can't just break
into a woman's apartment

86
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,100
in the middle
of the night and clean.

87
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,700
I had no choice.
I couldn't sleep knowing

88
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
that just outside my bedroom
was our living room,

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,100
and just outside our living room
was that hallway,

90
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,100
and immediately adjacent
to the hallway was... this.

91
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Do you realize
that if Penny wakes up,

92
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,100
there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here.

93
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,900
I just gave you
a reasonable explanation.

94
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,000
No, no, you gave me
an explanation.

95
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,500
Its reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

96
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Don't be ridiculous.
I have no peers.

97
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,200
We have to get out of here.

98
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,000
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

99
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
What?

100
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,900
Evolution has made women sensitive

101
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,800
to high-pitched noises
while they sleep

102
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
so that they'll be
roused by a crying baby.

103
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,600
If you want to avoid waking her,

104
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,500
speak in a lower register.

105
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,800
That's ridiculous!

106
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No.

107
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,400
"That's ridiculous."

108
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
Fine.

109
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,600
I accept your premise.
Now, please, let's go.

110
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

111
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,300
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

112
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,900
Oh, what the hell.

113
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
Morning.

114
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
Morning.

115
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,500
I have to say
I slept splendidly.

116
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,300
Granted, not long,
but just deeply and well.

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
I'm not surprised.

118
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,100
A well-known folk cure for insomnia

119
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,900
is to break in your neighbor's
apartment and clean.

120
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Sarcasm?

121
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
You think?

122
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Granted, my methods may have
been somewhat unorthodox,

123
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,200
but I think the end result
will be a measurable enhancement

124
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
- to Penny's quality of life
- You've convinced me.

125
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,500
Maybe tonight we should sneak in
and shampoo her carpet.

126
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,800
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

127
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,400
For God's sake,

128
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,300
do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

129
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,400
You have a sarcasm sign?

130
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
No, I do not have
a sarcasm sign.

131
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
Do you want some cereal?
I feel so good today,

132
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm gonna choose from
the low-fiber end of the shelf.

133
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,600
Hello, Honey Puffs.

134
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Son of a bitch!

135
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
Penny's up.

136
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,300
You sick geeky bastards!

137
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,400
How did she know it was us?

138
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,100
I may have left a suggested
organizational schematic

139
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,600
for her bedroom closet.

140
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,500
God, this is gonna be bad.

141
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,000
Good-bye, Honey Puffs.
Hello, Big Bran.

142
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
You came into my apartment last
night while I was sleeping?!

143
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes, but only to clean.

144
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,000
Really more to organize.
You're not actually dirty, per se.

145
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,500
Give me back my key.

146
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm very, very sorry.

147
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Do you understand
how creepy this is?

148
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
Oh, yes, we discussed it
at length last night.

149
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,200
In my apartment,
while I was sleeping?!

150
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
And snoring. And that's probably
just a sinus infection.

151
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,200
But it could be sleep apnea.

152
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,300
You might want to see
an otolaryngologist.

153
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
A throat doctor.

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,900
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,300
Depending on the depth,

156
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,200
that's either
a... proctologist

157
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,800
or a general surgeon.

158
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,600
I think what you're feeling

159
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,700
is perfectly valid
and maybe a little bit later

160
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,900
when you're feeling a little less...
for lack of a better word-- violated,

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,700
maybe we can talk
about this some more.

162
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,100
- Stay away from me.
- Sure, that's another way to go.

163
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Penny, Penny!

164
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,200
Just to clarify,

165
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
because there will be
a discussion when you leave,

166
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,200
is your objection
solely to our presence

167
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,100
in the apartment
while you were sleeping,

168
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,600
or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm.

169
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,100
Well, that was
a little non-responsive.

170
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,800
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

171
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
What's funny?

172
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,900
That wasn't sarcasm?

173
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,300
Boy, you are all over
the place this morning.

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,100
I have a master's and two Ph.D.s,
I should not have to do this.

175
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
What?!

176
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,300
I am truly sorry for what
happened last night.

177
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,000
I take full responsibility.

178
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,000
And I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard,

179
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,700
who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear,

180
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
a gentle and
thorough lover.

181
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,700
I did what I could.

182
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Hey, Raj.

183
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hey, listen.

184
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,900
I don't know if you heard about
what happened last night.

185
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,500
but I'm really upset about it.

186
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,800
I mean, they just...
they let themselves into my place

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,200
and then they cleaned it.
Can you even believe that?

188
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,500
How weird is that?

189
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
<i>She's standing very close to me.</i>

190
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,700
<i>Oh, my, she does smell good.</i>

191
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,900
<i>What is that, vanilla?</i>

192
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,400
You know,
where I come from,

193
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,500
if someone comes into your house
at night, you shoot. Okay?

194
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,000
And you don't shoot to wound.

195
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean, all right,
my sister shot her husband,

196
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,900
but it was an accident,
they were drunk.

197
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,300
Wait, what was I saying?

198
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,600
<i>She's so chatty.</i>

199
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,200
<i>Maybe my parents are right.</i>

200
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
<i>Maybe I'd be better off
with an Indian girl.</i>

201
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,300
<i>We'd have the same
cultural background</i>

202
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,900
<i>and my wife could sing to my children
the same lullabies my mother sang to me.</i>

203
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,000
It's obvious that they meant well,
but...

204
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm having a really rough time.
I broke up with my boyfriend

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,600
and...

206
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Just because most of the men I've known
in my life happen to be jerks,

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,700
doesn't mean I should just
assume Leonard and Sheldon are.

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Right?

209
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.</i>

210
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,900
That's exactly what I thought.

211
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,300
Thank you for listening.
You're a doll.

212
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,200
Turn your pelvis.

213
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,400
Grab a napkin, homie.
You just got served.

214
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,100
It's fine.You win.

215
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,000
What's his problem?

216
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,700
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

217
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Been there.

218
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Sorry I'm late,

219
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
but I was in the hallway,
chatting up Penny.

220
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,000
Really? You, Rajesh
Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?

221
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,000
Actually, I was less
the chatter than the chat-ee.

222
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
What did she say?
Is she still mad at me?

223
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,500
Well, she was upset at first,

224
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,200
but probably because
her sister shot somebody.

225
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
But then there was
something about you,

226
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,900
and then she hugged me.

227
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,900
She hugged you?
How'd she hug you?

228
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,300
Is that her perfume I smell?

229
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,100
Intoxicating, isn't it?

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hi.

231
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
What's going on?

232
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,100
Here's the thing.

233
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
"Just as Oppenheimer came
to regret his contributions

234
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,800
"to the first atomic bomb,

235
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,300
"so too I regret
my participation in what was,

236
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
"at the very least,
an error in judgment.

237
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
"The hallmark of the
great human experiment

238
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
"is the willingness to
recognize one's mistakes.

239
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,900
"Some mistakes, such as
Madam Curie's discovery of radium,

240
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,900
"turned out to have great
scientific potential,

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,300
"even though she would later die a slow,
painful death "from radiation poisoning.

242
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,300
Another example, from the
field of Ebola research..."

243
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
We're okay.

244
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,600
- Six two inch dowels.
- Check.

245
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,600
- One package Phillips head screws.
- Check.

246
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,700
You guys, seriously,
I grew up on a farm, okay?

247
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,000
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

248
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,500
I think I can put together a cheap,
Swedish media center.

249
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,600
No, please. We insist.
It's the least we can do, considering.

250
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,100
Considering what?

251
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,100
How great this place looks?

252
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,600
- Oh, boy. I was afraid of this.
- What?

253
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,500
These instructions are
a pictographic representation

254
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,600
of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

255
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,100
This, right here is why Sweden
has no space program.

256
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
Well, it looked
pretty good in the store.

257
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,500
It is an inefficient design.
For example, she has a flat screen TV,

258
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,700
which means all the space
behind it is wasted.

259
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,400
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

260
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,000
Run an infrared repeater.

261
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,300
Photo cell here, emitter here,
easy-peasy.

262
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,100
How are you gonna cool it?

263
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,400
- Hey, guys, I got this.
- Hang on, Penny.

264
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,000
How about fans?
Here and here.

265
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Also inefficient,
and might be loud.

266
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
How about liquid coolant?
Maybe a little aquarium pump here,

267
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,300
run some quarter-inch PVC...

268
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Guys, this is actually really simple.

269
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,700
Hold on, honey.
Men at work.

270
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,500
The PVC comes down here.

271
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,900
Maybe a little corrugated
sheet metal as a radiator here.

272
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,300
Yeah? Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice, and an overflow reservoir.

273
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,400
If water's involved, we're gonna have
to ground the crap out of the thing.

274
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,300
It's hot in here. I think
I'll just take off all my clothes.

275
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, I've got it.

276
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
What about if we replace

277
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,700
panels A, B and F and crossbar H
with aircraft-grade aluminum?

278
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,800
Right. Then the entire thing
is one heat sink.

279
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
You and Sheldon
go to the junkyard and pick up

280
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,300
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?

281
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,300
Raj and I
will get the oxyacetylene torch.

282
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
- Meet back here in an hour?
- Done.

283
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
Okay, this place does look pretty good.

9999
