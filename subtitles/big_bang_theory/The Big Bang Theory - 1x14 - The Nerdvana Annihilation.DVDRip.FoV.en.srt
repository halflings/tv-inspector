1
00:00:01,951 --> 00:00:05,512
Well, this sandwich
is an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,350
I asked for turkey and roast beef...

3
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:10,186
...lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.
- What did they give?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,194
Turkey and roast beef
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:23,129
It's the right ingredients
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:23,306 --> 00:00:26,070
In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

7
00:00:26,242 --> 00:00:29,541
...to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

8
00:00:30,246 --> 00:00:33,306
They might as well have dragged this thing
through a car wash.

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,215
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,316
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature time machine prop...

11
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,924
...from the original film
and no one is bidding.

12
00:00:43,093 --> 00:00:45,823
<i>A time machine
from the movie The Time Machine?</i>

13
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,163
<i>No, a time machine
from Sophie's Choice.</i>

14
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,199
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

15
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:54,563
Did you see it? It's rough.

16
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:57,264
Oh, that's cool.
Uh-huh.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
- It's only $800?
- Yeah. And that's my bid.

18
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,773
- You bid $800?
- It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

19
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,575
I figured it would go for thousands,
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

20
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,844
- There's only 30 seconds left in the auction.
- Do you have $800?

21
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,250
- Not to blow on a miniature time machine.
- Don't worry.

22
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:16,790
People wait until the last second,
then they get it. It's called sniping.

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,589
- Fifteen seconds.
- Come on, snipers.

24
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:24,926
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Where are your snipers?

25
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,694
- Five.
- Snipe.

26
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:27,894
- Four.
- Snipe.

27
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,096
- Three, two.
- Snipe, snipe.

28
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,467
- One.
- Ah!

29
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:37,336
Oh. Congratulations, you are the proud
owner of a miniature time machine.

30
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,141
- You lucky duck.
Heh.

31
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:40,782
I wonder why no one else bid.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,418
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

33
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,645
I know. But I still can't afford it.

34
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,347
Why don't we share it?
We'll each put in 200 bucks...

35
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,188
...and take turns having it in our house.
- A time-share time machine.

36
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,624
- I'm in. Sheldon?
- Wha...? Need you ask?

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,064
But I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

38
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,142
I understand why no one else bid.

39
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,943
Did the listing actually say miniature?

40
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:45,944
I just assumed.

41
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,986
Well, who sells a full-sized time machine
for $800?

42
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:53,782
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located...

43
00:02:53,957 --> 00:02:56,824
...within the intersection of
"no longer want time machine"...

44
00:02:56,993 --> 00:02:59,655
...and "need $800."

45
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,993
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

46
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:06,397
Even with shipping,
it works out to less than $4 a pound.

47
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,094
Cocktail shrimp are 12.50.

48
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,869
How are we gonna get it upstairs?

49
00:03:14,477 --> 00:03:17,207
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,871
Yes, but the elevator's been broken
for two years.

51
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,746
I've been meaning to ask you, do you think
we should make a call about that?

52
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,153
Not necessary.
I have a master's in engineering.

53
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:31,225
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

54
00:03:31,394 --> 00:03:34,830
I troubleshoot space-shuttle payloads.

55
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:37,262
When the Mars rover
started pulling to the left...

56
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:43,133
...I performed a front-end alignment
from 62 million miles away.

57
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,374
No, that baby's broken.

58
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,217
Come on, guys, push.

59
00:03:58,388 --> 00:04:02,586
If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

60
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,488
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,994
It's the same amount of work,
no matter how fast you go. Basic physics.

62
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,358
Sheldon.
- Yeah?

63
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,866
If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

64
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:16,094
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

65
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,707
Take a break, guys.

66
00:04:22,545 --> 00:04:25,878
- What are you doing?
- Just moving something upstairs.

67
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:30,549
- What is it?
- Just, you know, a time machine.

68
00:04:31,154 --> 00:04:33,122
Okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

69
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,224
- Just give us a few minutes.
- I'm running really late.

70
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:37,791
Then I have a simple solution.

71
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,953
Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building... There's a gap.

72
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,896
Don't look down if you're subject
to vertigo.... And use their stairwell.

73
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,365
- You're joking, right?
- Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

74
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:53,373
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

75
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,738
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine...

76
00:04:55,912 --> 00:04:58,107
...I can drop you off at work yesterday.

77
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,341
Time-travel joke. It's not... Never mind.

78
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:07,112
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

79
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,258
Let's just do this.

80
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:14,988
- You guys ready to push?
In a minute.

81
00:05:15,164 --> 00:05:17,758
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

82
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:27,108
I don't know what you were worried about.
I think it really works in the room.

83
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:31,506
Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

84
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,650
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor...

85
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,615
...from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future...

86
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:40,051
...where society had splintered
into two factions:

87
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,588
The subterranean Morlocks...

88
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,785
...who survived by feasting on the flesh
of the gentle surface-dwelling Eloi.

89
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,963
Talk about your chick magnets.

90
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,068
Oh, yeah. The guy who lives next to me
is always like:

91
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,696
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. "

92
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,811
But wait until I tell him
I've got a time machine on my balcony.

93
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,274
Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob.

94
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:09,646
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns...

95
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,380
...but I think you'll agree
that practicality dictates it remain here.

96
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:15,854
You can't keep it.
What if I meet a girl and say:

97
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,721
"You wanna see my time machine?
It's at my friend's house. "

98
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:21,022
How lame is that?

99
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,721
- He's got a point.
All right.

100
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,494
We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine. "

101
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,194
"No eating in the time machine. "
I propose that we add:

102
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:33,103
"Pants must be worn at all times
in the time machine. "

103
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,205
Seconded.

104
00:06:35,678 --> 00:06:38,044
I was gonna put down a towel.

105
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:45,120
I still want it on my balcony.
I say we move it on a bimonthly basis.

106
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,257
- That sounds fair.
- Hold on. Bimonthly is an ambiguous term.

107
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:51,018
- Every other month or twice a month?
- Twice a month.

108
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,185
- Then no.
- Okay, every other month.

109
00:06:53,362 --> 00:06:54,920
No.

110
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,132
Sheldon, you can't be selfish.

111
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,632
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

112
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,771
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

113
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:16,478
Okay. I am setting the dials
for March 10th, 1876.

114
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:20,247
Good choice. Alexander Graham Bell invents
the telephone and calls for Watson.

115
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:23,915
- Wait a minute. I wanna see that too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

116
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:27,585
If we all go back to the same time,
Bell's lab's going to get very crowded.

117
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:29,754
He'll know something's up.

118
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,059
Since the time machine
doesn't move in space...

119
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:35,432
...you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.
- Even if you make it to Boston...

120
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:39,063
...what are you gonna do? Knock and say
to Mrs. Bell, "Fan of your husband.

121
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:42,075
Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

122
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:45,112
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even gonna hear you knock.

123
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:48,580
I have a solution.
First, go into the future...

124
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,686
...and obtain a cloaking device.
- Ooh. How far into the future?

125
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:55,255
If I remember, Kirk will steal
a cloaking device from the Romulans...

126
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,551
...on stardate 5027.3...

127
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,959
...which would be January 10th, 2328,
by pre-Federation reckoning.

128
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:07,766
Okay, I am setting the dials
for January 10th, 2328.

129
00:08:07,937 --> 00:08:11,270
Here we go into the future.

130
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:32,816
That was fun.

131
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,224
My turn.

132
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:40,700
Okay, first of all, what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

133
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,838
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

134
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,835
The door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked.

135
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:49,705
I had to go down the fire escape
on the third floor...

136
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,780
...forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely family...

137
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,383
...who insisted I stay for lunch.

138
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:57,314
That doesn't sound too bad.

139
00:08:57,486 --> 00:09:01,718
It was eight courses of lamb.
And they tried to fix me up with their son.

140
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:04,486
- I'm sorry.
- Not done.

141
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,322
By the time I got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

142
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:10,829
Yeah, that's right.
I've lost an entire day's pay thanks to this.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,661
- This...
- Time machine.

144
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,438
- Lights flash and the dish spins. Wanna try?
- No.

145
00:09:20,176 --> 00:09:23,612
I don't wanna try it.
My God, you are grown men.

146
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,475
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys...

147
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,584
...and costumes and comic books,
and now that?

148
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:33,119
- That...
- Again, time machine.

149
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,950
Oh, please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like...

150
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,027
...something Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

151
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,733
It only moves in time.

152
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:51,202
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

153
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,481
Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.

154
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,648
My turn.

155
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,630
Leonard, it's 2 in the morning.

156
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:29,506
- So?
- So it's my turn.

157
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,545
Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

158
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,279
Because I wanna go back and keep myself
from getting a time machine.

159
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:42,788
You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

160
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,018
...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

161
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:50,427
Ergo, you would still have it.
This is a classic rookie time-travel mistake.

162
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:56,499
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

163
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:58,030
Same paradox.

164
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,108
If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

165
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,837
...you would not have the conversation
motivating you...

166
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,345
...to go back and knock me unconscious.

167
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,018
What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

168
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,615
It won't change the past.

169
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,518
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

170
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,993
Are you upset about something?

171
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:23,131
What was your first clue?

172
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,666
Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.

173
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:28,701
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.

174
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,702
- Plus your irritability...
- Yes, I'm upset.

175
00:11:30,873 --> 00:11:31,897
Oh.

176
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:34,872
I don't usually pick up on those things.

177
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:36,671
Good for me.

178
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,305
Yeah, good for you.

179
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,544
Oh, wait.

180
00:11:44,353 --> 00:11:46,753
Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?

181
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:50,821
- I don't know. Maybe.
- Wow, I'm on fire tonight.

182
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,893
Well, here's the thing.

183
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:02,163
Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.

184
00:12:02,571 --> 00:12:03,731
I disagree.

185
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:06,204
Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

186
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,572
...long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

187
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,340
That failure clearly stands on its own.

188
00:12:15,384 --> 00:12:18,444
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

189
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:21,522
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...

190
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,089
...with that time machine.

191
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,955
<i>In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...</i>

192
00:12:26,128 --> 00:12:28,926
...with his extremely attractive
young mother.

193
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:34,061
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

194
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:38,730
Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?

195
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,544
That's absurd.

196
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,344
Come on, guys, push.

197
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:50,042
If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

198
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:52,477
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

199
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,990
Take a break, guys.

200
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,718
What are you doing?

201
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:03,558
You know, just moving a time machine.

202
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:06,665
Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

203
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,599
No problem.

204
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,102
Hang on.

205
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,979
But what about your time machine?

206
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:22,208
Some things are more important
than toys.

207
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,916
I'm scared.

208
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:34,255
Don't worry, baby, I've got you.

209
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,762
Oh, Leonard.

210
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:57,876
It's still my turn.

211
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,122
What are you doing?

212
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:09,956
I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking
them down to the comic-book store to sell.

213
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:12,261
Is that really necessary?

214
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,528
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

215
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,663
And semen.

216
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,535
It's not about money.

217
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,807
We brought food.

218
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:26,004
Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

219
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:28,843
Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?

220
00:14:29,018 --> 00:14:30,986
- Why?
- Because I don't want it anymore.

221
00:14:31,153 --> 00:14:33,553
- Why?
- Just personal reasons.

222
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:36,748
My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.

223
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,488
Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?

224
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:43,462
I'll give you $ 100, which will make me
half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.

225
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,499
Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.

226
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:50,105
- I paid $200 for my share.
- Everybody knows a time machine loses...

227
00:14:50,272 --> 00:14:53,366
...half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.

228
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:56,438
I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.

229
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:00,207
<i>Three hundred. And I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...</i>

230
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,247
...with real light-speed sound effects.

231
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:07,117
No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...

232
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:10,690
...or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.

233
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,759
I'm getting rid of all of it.

234
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,953
You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

235
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,564
It's like Nerdvana.

236
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:23,432
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

237
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,907
<i>- Not for long.
- I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.</i>

238
00:15:28,077 --> 00:15:31,069
I need that to complete
my Justice Society of America collection.

239
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,543
- I called dibs.
- You can't.

240
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:35,582
I can and I did.
Look up dibs in Wikipedia.

241
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:38,280
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.

242
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:42,220
It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.

243
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:45,326
- Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
- Would you forget dibs?

244
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:47,894
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

245
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:52,329
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.

246
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:56,164
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business. Take it or leave it.

247
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,863
Mom, my bar mitzvah bonds,
how much do I got?

248
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,000
Thanks. I can go $2600
and two trees in Israel.

249
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,614
Forget it. Guys, if I sell to one of you,
the other two are gonna be mad at me.

250
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:11,753
Who cares? As long as you pick me.

251
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,979
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

252
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:16,317
Sorry, Raj, my mind is made up.

253
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:19,757
No. I can't let you do this.

254
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:23,022
Sheldon, get out of my way.

255
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,030
None shall pass.

256
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:32,571
Okay.

257
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,299
I did not wanna do this...

258
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,536
...but I have here the rare,
mint-condition, production-era...

259
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:41,274
<i>...Star Trek: The Next Generation
Geordi La Forge without his VISOR...</i>

260
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,815
...in the original packaging.

261
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:45,819
If you do not get out of my way...

262
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:47,819
...I will open it.

263
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,659
Okay, man, be cool.

264
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:53,020
We're all friends here.

265
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,890
What the hell's going on?

266
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:58,693
- You hypocrite.
- What?

267
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,358
Little Miss Grown-Ups-
Don't-Play-With-Toys.

268
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:05,064
If I went into that apartment right now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

269
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,107
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

270
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,212
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

271
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,905
Hello, Hello Kitty.

272
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,982
Okay, okay, look,
if this is about yesterday, Leonard...

273
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,885
...I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

274
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,788
- No, I needed to hear it.
- You didn't. You are a great guy.

275
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,158
And it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

276
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,725
I guess that makes me large breasts.

277
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:39,135
Still, I think it's time for me
to get rid of this stuff...

278
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,175
...and, you know, move on with my life.

279
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:45,006
- Really?
- Yeah.

280
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,477
Oh. Wow.

281
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,411
Good for you.

282
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,509
Thanks.

283
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:54,382
Hey, do you wanna,
I don't know, later...?

284
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:56,046
Excuse me.

285
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,720
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

286
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,758
- You ready to go?
- I just have to change.

287
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,692
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, stop it.

288
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:04,492
Bye, guys.

289
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:11,130
My turn on the time machine.

290
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,562
It worked.

291
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,829
It really worked.

292
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:44,998
They said I was mad, but it worked.

293
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,976
Oh, no, not Morlocks.

294
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,743
Not flesh-eating Morlocks.

295
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,480
Help!

296
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:09,324
Sheldon, you okay?

297
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,227
We have to get rid of the time machine.

298
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,835
It is a little big for the living room,
isn't it?

299
00:19:15,804 --> 00:19:18,170
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

300
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,368
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

301
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,511
Come on in, fellas.

302
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:28,539
Oh, no, Morlocks.
