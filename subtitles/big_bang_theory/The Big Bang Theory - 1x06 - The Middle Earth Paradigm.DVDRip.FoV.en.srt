1
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:10,124
Okay, if no one else will say it, I will.

2
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:12,785
We really suck at paintball.

3
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,893
That was absolutely humiliating.

4
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:19,058
Oh, come on. Some battles
you win, some battles you lose.

5
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:24,605
Yes, but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Bernstein's bar mitzvah party.

6
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:30,473
I think we have to acknowledge, those were
some fairly savage preadolescent Jews.

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,947
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence...

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,178
...and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

9
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:39,685
Sheldon, let it go.

10
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:44,122
No, I wanna talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the back.

11
00:00:44,694 --> 00:00:48,926
I shot you for a good reason.
You were leading us into disaster.

12
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,493
I was giving clear, concise orders.

13
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,101
You hid behind a tree yelling:

14
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:56,102
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

15
00:00:56,272 --> 00:00:57,739
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

16
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:59,602
- Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

17
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:02,636
So how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

18
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,714
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,715
You clear a space on your calendar.
There will be an inquiry.

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,481
Okay. Um...

21
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,488
I'm having a party on Saturday,
so if you're around, come by.

22
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,818
- A party?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,894
A boy-girl party?

24
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,323
There will be boys
and there will be girls...

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,058
...and it is a party, so...

26
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,204
Just a bunch of my friends,
have some beer, do a little dancing.

27
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,497
- Dancing?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,731
- I don't know, Penny...
- Thing is, we're not...

29
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,637
- We're really more of a...
- No.

30
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:37,204
But thanks.
Thanks for thinking of us.

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,007
Are you sure? It's Halloween.

32
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,547
A Halloween party?

33
00:01:40,717 --> 00:01:42,150
As in costumes?

34
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:43,683
Well, yeah.

35
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:53,962
Is there a theme?

36
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,654
Um, yeah, Halloween.

37
00:01:56,432 --> 00:01:59,333
Yes, but are the costumes random
or genre-specific?

38
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,597
As usual, I'm not following.

39
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:05,935
He's asking if we can come as anyone
from science fiction...

40
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,201
...fantasy...
- Sure.

41
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,674
- Comic books?
- Fine.

42
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:10,312
- Anime?
- Of course.

43
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,880
TV, film, D&D, manga.
Greek, Roman, Norse gods...

44
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,141
Anything you want.

45
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:17,184
Okay? Any costume you want.

46
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,883
Bye.

47
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:24,222
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

48
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,884
I'll get it.

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,257
Psshoo.

50
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,094
Oh, no.

51
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,531
Oh, no.

52
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:16,209
Make way for the fastest man alive.

53
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:17,710
Oh, no.

54
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:20,645
See, this is why I wanted
to have a costume meeting.

55
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,183
We all have other costumes.
We can change.

56
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:26,244
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night.

57
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:29,118
It'll look like one person
going really fast.

58
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:37,627
No, no, no.

59
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,793
It's a boy-girl party,
this Flash runs solo.

60
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,972
Okay, how about this?
Nobody gets to be the Flash.

61
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,199
We all change. Agreed?

62
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,578
Agreed.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,108
I call Frodo!

64
00:03:52,282 --> 00:03:53,510
Damn.

65
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,980
Hey.

66
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,929
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck
in the door on the bus.

67
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,192
- You went with Thor?
- What?

68
00:04:10,366 --> 00:04:13,267
Just because I'm Indian,
I can't be a Norse god?

69
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:16,371
No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian god.

70
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:17,836
That's racism.

71
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:21,602
I mean, look at Wolowitz. He's not English,
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

72
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,942
Sheldon is neither sound nor light,
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

73
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:35,113
- I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.
- Really?

74
00:04:35,558 --> 00:04:38,857
<i>Because I saw Peter Pan
and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.</i>

75
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,264
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

76
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,261
Sheldon, there's something
I wanna talk to you about before we go.

77
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:52,465
I don't care if anybody gets it,
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

78
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:57,369
- No, it's not that...
- If I have to, I can demonstrate: Vroom.

79
00:05:00,249 --> 00:05:02,581
Terrific. Um...

80
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:05,654
This party is my first chance for Penny...

81
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:08,882
...to see me in the context
of her social group...

82
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,720
...and I need you not
to embarrass me tonight.

83
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,886
What exactly do you mean
by embarrass you?

84
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:21,067
For example, tonight, no one needs to know
that my middle name is Leakey.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,228
But there's nothing embarrassing
about that.

86
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:26,603
Your father worked with Louis Leakey,
a great anthropologist.

87
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:29,336
It had nothing to do
with your bed-wetting.

88
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,781
All I'm saying is that this party
is the perfect opportunity...

89
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,010
...for Penny to see me
as a member of her peer group...

90
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:40,417
...a potential close friend
and perhaps more.

91
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:44,622
I don't wanna look like a dork.

92
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,832
Just a heads up, fellas,
if anyone gets lucky...

93
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,531
...I've got a dozen condoms in my quiver.

94
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,839
Oh, hey, guys.

95
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,536
Hey, sorry we're late.

96
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:06,545
Late? It's 7:05.

97
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:08,741
And you said the party starts at 7.

98
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:14,618
Yeah, I mean, when you start a party at 7,
no one shows up at, you know, 7.

99
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,782
It's 7:05.

100
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,325
Yes, yes, it is.

101
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:21,861
Okay, well, um, come on in.

102
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,466
What, are all the girls in the bathroom?

103
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,209
Probably, but in their own homes.

104
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,373
So, what time
does the costume parade start?

105
00:06:40,116 --> 00:06:41,344
The parade?

106
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:44,350
Yeah, so the judges can give out
the prizes for best costume.

107
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,283
Most frightening, most authentic...

108
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:50,119
...most accurate visualization
of a scientific principle.

109
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,395
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry...

110
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:57,727
...but there aren't gonna be any parades
or judges or prizes.

111
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,426
This party is just going to suck.

112
00:07:01,604 --> 00:07:04,368
No, come on, it's gonna be fun.
And you all look great.

113
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,441
I mean, look at you, Thor,
and, oh, Peter Pan.

114
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:09,669
That's so cute.

115
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,974
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin...
- I'm Peter Pan.

116
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:17,207
And I've got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

117
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:19,948
No, you don't.

118
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:26,356
- Hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?
- Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

119
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,225
Yes, it's the apparent change
in the frequency of a wave...

120
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:33,129
...caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

121
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:38,668
Oh, sure, I see it now.
The Doppler effect.

122
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,368
All right, I gotta shower. You guys,
um, make yourselves comfortable.

123
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:44,437
Okay.

124
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,210
See? People get it.

125
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:05,166
Mm. By Odin's beard,
this is good Chex Mix.

126
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:06,699
No, thanks. Peanuts.

127
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:09,895
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

128
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,266
I'm confused.

129
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,341
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

130
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:18,071
We're socializing, meeting new people.

131
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,579
Telepathically?

132
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:24,085
- Oh, hey. When did you get here?
Hi.

133
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,648
Penny is wearing the worst
Catwoman costume I've ever seen.

134
00:08:27,823 --> 00:08:29,654
And that includes Halle Berry's.

135
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,623
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

136
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,695
And that's the kind
of sloppy costuming...

137
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:38,095
...which results
from a lack of rules and competition.

138
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,667
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

139
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:47,969
I believe it's time for me
to turn my head and cough.

140
00:08:48,978 --> 00:08:52,379
- What is your move?
- I'm going to use the mirror technique.

141
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:55,381
She brushes her hair back, I brush mine.
She shrugs, I shrug.

142
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,043
Subconsciously, she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together. "

143
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,383
Where do you get this stuff?

144
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,390
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research.

145
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,519
And there's this great show on VH1
about how to pick up girls.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,991
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

147
00:09:13,169 --> 00:09:15,467
I have such difficulty
speaking to women...

148
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,836
...or around women,
or at times even effeminate men.

149
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,139
If that's a working stethoscope...

150
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,837
...maybe you'd like to hear
my heart skip a beat.

151
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:27,978
No, thanks.

152
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,313
No, seriously, you can.
I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.

153
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,023
I wanna get to know Penny's friends.
I just...

154
00:09:41,197 --> 00:09:43,688
I don't know
how to talk to these people.

155
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,825
- Well, I actually might be able to help.
- How so?

156
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,495
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes...

157
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,404
...I initially saw their interactions
as confusing and unstructured.

158
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:55,601
But patterns emerge.

159
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,179
They have their own language,
if you will.

160
00:10:00,116 --> 00:10:01,515
Go on.

161
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,017
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group...

162
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,747
...with the greeting,
"How wasted am I?"

163
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:11,689
Which is met
with an approving chorus of "Dude. "

164
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:13,588
Then what happens?

165
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:15,390
That's as far as I've gotten.

166
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,197
This is ridiculous.

167
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,358
- I'm jumping in.
- Good luck.

168
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,935
No, you're coming with me.

169
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,095
Oh, I hardly think so.

170
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:25,297
Come on.

171
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:30,072
- Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, but I need a wingman.

172
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,044
All right, but if we're going
to use flight metaphors...

173
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,879
...I'm much more suited to being the guy
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

174
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:41,319
Oh, hi.

175
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,718
- Hi.
- Hello.

176
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:44,887
So, what are you supposed to be?

177
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,619
Me?

178
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,855
I'll give you a hint.

179
00:10:49,031 --> 00:10:50,589
Vroom.

180
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,996
A choo-choo train?

181
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,267
Close.

182
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,235
Vroom.

183
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,499
A brain-damaged choo-choo train?

184
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:04,769
How wasted am I?

185
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,416
Vroom.

186
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,056
I still don't get it.

187
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:18,989
I'm the Doppler effect.

188
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:21,561
Okay, if that is some sort
of learning disability...

189
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,892
...I think it's very insensitive.

190
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,727
Why don't you just tell people
you're a zebra?

191
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:31,665
Why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

192
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:32,933
Because I'm Frodo.

193
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:36,044
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

194
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:39,003
- Oh, no.
- What?

195
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:41,178
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

196
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,045
What do you suppose he's doing here?

197
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,416
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

198
00:11:47,423 --> 00:11:50,221
If he were any bigger,
he'd have moons orbiting him.

199
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:52,623
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha.

200
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,388
So I guess we'll be leaving now.

201
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:57,327
Why should we leave?

202
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,095
For all we know, he crashed the party
and Penny doesn't even want him here.

203
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,206
You have a backup hypothesis?

204
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:07,274
Maybe they just wanna be friends.

205
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,769
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

206
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,710
Then he and I are on equal ground.

207
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:17,148
Yes, but you're much closer to it
than he is.

208
00:12:18,421 --> 00:12:22,619
Look, if this was 15,000 years ago,
by virtue of his size and strength...

209
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,488
...Kurt would be entitled
to his choice of female partners.

210
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,653
And male partners, animal partners,
large primordial eggplants...

211
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,322
...pretty much
whatever tickled his fancy.

212
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,596
Yes, but our society
has undergone a paradigm shift.

213
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,002
In the information age, Sheldon,
you and I are the alpha males.

214
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,666
- And we shouldn't have to back down.
- True.

215
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:45,041
Why don't you text him that
and see if he backs down?

216
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:47,375
No.

217
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:51,444
I'm going to assert
my dominance face to face.

218
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,712
Face to face?

219
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:56,517
Are you gonna wait for him to sit down
or you gonna stand on the coffee table?

220
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,790
Hello, Penny. Hello, Kurt.

221
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,759
Oh, hey, guys.
You having a good time?

222
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,558
Given the reaction to my costume...

223
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:07,566
...this party is a scathing indictment
of the American education system.

224
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,629
What? You're a zebra, right?

225
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,197
Yet another child left behind.

226
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,037
And what are you supposed to be,
an elf?

227
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,440
No, I'm a hobbit.

228
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:18,875
What's the difference?

229
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,040
A hobbit is a mortal, halfling inhabitant
of Middle-earth...

230
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,346
...whereas an elf
is an immortal, tall warrior.

231
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,388
So why the hell
would you wanna be a hobbit?

232
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:32,852
Because he's neither tall nor immortal,
and none of us could be the Flash.

233
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,125
Well, whatever. Why don't you go hop off
on a quest? I'm talking to Penny here.

234
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,268
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

235
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:41,801
I'm not. No offense.

236
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,539
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

237
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,732
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

238
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,503
Oh, I am being nice.

239
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:51,475
Right, little buddy?

240
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:53,740
- Kurt.
- Okay.

241
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,778
I understand your impulse
to try to physically intimidate me.

242
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,387
You can't compete with me
on an intellectual level...

243
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,354
...and so you're driven
to animalistic puffery.

244
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:05,790
You calling me a puffy animal?

245
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,053
Oh, of course not.

246
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,561
No, he's not. You're not, right, Leonard?

247
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,700
No, I said animalistic.

248
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,358
Of course, we're all animals...

249
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:17,904
...but some of us have climbed
a little higher on the evolutionary tree.

250
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:20,234
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

251
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,274
So what? I'm unevolved?

252
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,706
You're in trouble.

253
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,947
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

254
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,175
Okay, Kurt, please.

255
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,613
Look, Penny, it's okay.

256
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,048
I can handle this.

257
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,985
I am not a dwarf, I'm a hobbit.

258
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:37,182
A hobbit.

259
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,590
Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus
preventing the conversion...

260
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,254
...from short-term to long-term memory?

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,225
Okay, now you're starting
to make me mad.

262
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:52,235
<i>A Homo habilis discovering
his opposable thumbs says, "What?"</i>

263
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,607
- What?
- Ha-ha.

264
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,547
I think I've made my point.

265
00:15:00,716 --> 00:15:03,708
Yeah? How about I make a point
out of your pointy little head?

266
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:07,822
Let me remind you, while my moral support
is absolute, in a physical confrontation...

267
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,685
...I will be less than useless.

268
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,792
There's not going to be a confrontation.

269
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:15,897
In fact, I doubt
if he can even spell confrontation.

270
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:20,735
C- O-N...

271
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:22,900
Frontation.

272
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:26,400
- Kurt, put him down this instant.
- He started it.

273
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,442
I don't care, I'm finishing it.
Put him down.

274
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:31,204
Fine.

275
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,276
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

276
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:38,348
He's a hobbit.

277
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,351
I got your back.

278
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,418
Leonard, are you okay?

279
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,422
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

280
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:50,793
It's a good party. Thanks for having...
It's just getting a little late, so...

281
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,465
Oh. Okay. All right.
Well, thank you for coming.

282
00:15:57,773 --> 00:15:58,967
Happy Halloween.

283
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:04,039
If it's any consolation...

284
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,842
<i>...I thought that Homo habilis line
really put him in his place.</i>

285
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:19,355
- What's that?
- Tea.

286
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,256
When people are upset...

287
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,661
...the cultural convention
is to bring them hot beverages.

288
00:16:31,006 --> 00:16:32,701
There, there.

289
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,671
You wanna talk about it?

290
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,870
- No.
- Good.

291
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:41,980
"There, there" was really all I had.

292
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,445
- Good night, Sheldon.
- Good night, Leonard.

293
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,729
- Hey, Leonard?
- Hi, Penny.

294
00:16:54,897 --> 00:16:57,161
Hey, I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

295
00:16:57,332 --> 00:16:59,459
I'm fine.

296
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:02,901
I am so sorry about what happened.

297
00:17:03,072 --> 00:17:04,699
It's not your fault.

298
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:07,273
Yes, it is.
That's why I broke up with him.

299
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,037
He always does stuff like that.

300
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,313
So why was he at your party?

301
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,982
Well, I ran into him last week...

302
00:17:18,153 --> 00:17:21,589
...and he was just all apologetic
about how he's changed.

303
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,851
He was just going on and on,
and I believed him.

304
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:28,190
And I'm an idiot,
because I always believe guys like that.

305
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

306
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:35,560
And I know you don't wanna hear this. I'm
upset and really drunk and I just wanna...

307
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,612
There, there.

308
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,644
God, what is wrong with me?

309
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,253
Nothing, you're perfect.

310
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,787
Ecch. I'm not perfect.

311
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,254
Yes, you are.

312
00:17:59,094 --> 00:18:01,255
You really think so, don't you?

313
00:18:15,377 --> 00:18:17,675
- Penny?
- Yeah?

314
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:21,477
How much have you had
to drink tonight?

315
00:18:23,452 --> 00:18:26,615
Just... a lot.

316
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,425
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt...

317
00:18:31,593 --> 00:18:34,255
...doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

318
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:37,526
It might.

319
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:41,929
Boy, you're really smart.

320
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:44,868
Yeah, I'm a freaking genius.

321
00:18:49,344 --> 00:18:51,278
Leonard, you are so great.

322
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:53,437
Why can't all guys be like you?

323
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,820
Because if all guys were like me,
the human race couldn't survive.

324
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,021
I should probably go.

325
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:05,450
Probably.

326
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,667
Thank you.

327
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:29,340
That's right, you saw what you saw.

328
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,016
That's how we roll in the Shire.
