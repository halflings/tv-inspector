1
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,685
Damn you, WalletNook. Com.

2
00:00:13,663 --> 00:00:14,687
Problem?

3
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:17,128
The online description
was completely misleading.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,768
They said eight slots plus removable ID.

5
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,837
To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.

6
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:25,873
But they don't tell you,
the removable ID takes up one slot.

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,942
It's a nightmare.

8
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,102
Okay, now, do you really need...

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,875
...the honorary Justice League
of America membership card?

10
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,512
It's been in every wallet
I've owned since I was 5.

11
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:39,214
Why?

12
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:42,552
It says, "Keep this on your person
at all times. "

13
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:45,827
It's right here, under Batman's signature.

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,025
And this is Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

15
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,795
Guess whose parents just got broadband.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,906
Leonard, may I present, live from New Delhi,
Dr. And Mrs. V. M. Koothrappali?

17
00:00:58,074 --> 00:00:59,098
Hi.

18
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,709
<i>Tilt up the camera.
I'm looking at his crotch.</i>

19
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,209
Sorry, Papa.

20
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,643
<i>- Oh, that's much better. Hi.
- Hi.</i>

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:09,444
- And over here is Sheldon.
Hi.

22
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:10,711
He lives with Leonard.

23
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,981
<i>Oh, that's nice. Like Haroon and Tanvir.</i>

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,715
No, not like Haroon and Tanvir.

25
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:17,359
<i>MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Such sweet young men.</i>

26
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:20,462
<i>They just adopted
the cutest little Punjabi baby.</i>

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,656
Yeah. No, we're not
like Haroon and Tanvir.

28
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:26,898
<i>- So are you boys academics like our son?
- Yes.</i>

29
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,834
<i>Your parents are comfortable
with limited earning potential?</i>

30
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,496
- Oh, yes.
- Not at all.

31
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:33,272
Papa, please don't start.

32
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,536
<i>What? It's just a question.
He's so sensitive.</i>

33
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:38,180
That's my life, my friends.
Good to see you. Say bye.

34
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,372
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

35
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,141
<i>DR. KOOTHRAPPALl:
Wait, wait.</i>

36
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:44,449
<i>Before you go, we have good news.</i>

37
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:47,613
<i>Put the computer down
and gather your friends.</i>

38
00:01:51,628 --> 00:01:54,620
<i>- What is it, Papa?
- I don't see your friends.</i>

39
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:01,460
Is it just me or does web-chatting with
your clothes on seem a little pointless?

40
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:04,698
<i>Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta?</i>

41
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:08,605
The little fat girl that used to kick me
in the samosas and call me untouchable?

42
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:11,872
<i>Yes. Well, now she's
a dental student at USC...</i>

43
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,209
<i>...so we gave her
your contact information.</i>

44
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:16,009
Why did you do that?

45
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:18,814
<i>You're 26 years old, Rajesh.
We want grandchildren.</i>

46
00:02:18,988 --> 00:02:22,788
<i>- But, Papa, I'm not supposed...
- Lalita's parents approved the match.</i>

47
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,894
<i>If you decide on a spring wedding,
we can avoid monsoon season.</i>

48
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,723
A spring wedding?

49
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,762
<i>It's up to you. We don't want to meddle.</i>

50
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:32,197
If you don't want to meddle,
why are you meddling?

51
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:34,427
Your parents don't consider this meddling.

52
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:36,868
While arranged marriages
are no longer the norm...

53
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,771
...Indian parents continue to have
an involvement in their children's love lives.

54
00:02:40,944 --> 00:02:43,674
Why are you telling me
about my own culture?

55
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:45,744
You seemed confused.

56
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,543
<i>- Sorry, but with all due respect, I don't...
- I'm sorry, darling. We have to go.</i>

57
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:53,416
<i>Doogie Howser is on.</i>

58
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,690
<i>Grandma, it's Doogie time.</i>

59
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,589
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

60
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:03,293
I don't believe it.

61
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,490
Neither do I.

62
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,329
<i>Doogie Howser's been off the air
for like 20 years.</i>

63
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,836
Actually, I read that it's one of
the most popular programs in India.

64
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:16,240
Might speak to a cultural aspiration to have
one's children enter the medical profession.

65
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,671
I bet you're right.

66
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:20,008
<i>- I bet they love Scrubs.
- What's not to love?</i>

67
00:03:20,183 --> 00:03:21,673
Excuse me, hello?

68
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,409
My parents are trying to marry me off
to a stranger. What am I going to do?

69
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,585
- I suggest you go through with it.
- What?

70
00:03:28,758 --> 00:03:33,161
Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

71
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,231
Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.

72
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,300
<i>It's the premise of Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

73
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,336
I'm not a big fan of musicals,
but I love that show.

74
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,837
Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.

75
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:49,377
Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

76
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:51,979
Let's not forget
it's got some really catchy tunes.

77
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:53,672
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

78
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,477
- I know what I'm gonna do.
- What?

79
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,085
Find new friends.

80
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,492
<i>- So who wants to rent Fiddler?
- No need. We have the special edition.</i>

81
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:12,058
Well, maybe we are like
Haroon and Tanvir.

82
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,360
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

83
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,156
Yeah, I need to cancel my membership
to the planetarium.

84
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,458
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too...

85
00:04:45,635 --> 00:04:48,604
...but there's just no room
for you in my wallet.

86
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:54,136
No, I understand, but it was between
you and the Museum of Natural History...

87
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,676
...and frankly, you don't have dinosaurs.

88
00:04:58,348 --> 00:05:00,816
Oh, I'll miss you too. Bye-bye.

89
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:05,379
Okay, I know you're texting about me
and I'd really like you to stop.

90
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:10,956
Oh, dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.

91
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,992
I thought you were finding new friends.

92
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,959
I've got some feelers out.

93
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:17,490
In the meantime, listen to this.

94
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,965
<i>Hi, Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta.</i>

95
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:23,230
<i>Your mother gave my mother
your phone number to give to me.</i>

96
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:27,843
<i>So I'm calling you and call me back.</i>

97
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:29,501
<i>Bye.</i>

98
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:32,377
Can you believe how pushy she is?

99
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,050
So don't call her.

100
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,517
If I don't call her,
I won't hear the end of it.

101
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:41,782
- So call her.
- How can I call her? I can't talk to women.

102
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,652
I'm done. Anybody else?

103
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:46,052
- Give me the phone.
- Why?

104
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,424
Just give it to me. Sh.

105
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,624
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, you'll thank me.

106
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,333
Hello, Lalita? Raj Koothrappali.

107
00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:00,400
Yes, it is good to talk to you too.

108
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:04,313
So, what are you wearing?

109
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,774
Oh, not important.

110
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,647
So anyhow,
when would you like to meet?

111
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,213
Friday works for me.

112
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:18,326
I'll call you with a time and place.

113
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:21,952
In the meantime, keep it real, babe.

114
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,497
You may now thank me.

115
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,207
<i>For what, making me sound
like a Simpsons character?</i>

116
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,974
- Next time, make your own date.
- Didn't wanna make this one.

117
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,604
Look on the bright side, she might
turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.

118
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:43,411
Great, we get married,
I won't be able to talk to her...

119
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:46,555
...and we'll spend the rest of our lives
in total silence.

120
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:48,314
It worked for my parents.

121
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:51,421
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hey.

122
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:52,618
I need guinea pigs.

123
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:57,232
Okay, there's a lab animal supply
company in Reseda you could try.

124
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,200
But if your research is going to have
human applications, I suggest white mice.

125
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,396
Their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.

126
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:09,099
I swear to God, Sheldon, one day,
I'm gonna get the hang of talking to you.

127
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:12,738
His mom's been saying that for years.

128
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,451
- What's up?
- Well, I convinced the restaurant...

129
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,817
...to give me a bartending shift
so I need to practice mixing drinks.

130
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,086
Oh, well, great. The key to acquiring
proficiency in any task is repetition.

131
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,888
With certain obvious exceptions.

132
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,797
Suicide, for example.

133
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,394
So, Leonard, how about it?

134
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:39,402
Penny, we'd love to help you, but Raj
is going through some stuff right now.

135
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:42,135
And besides, he doesn't drink, so...

136
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,312
Really?

137
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,406
Um...

138
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:52,452
Raj is going through some stuff right now
and he'd like to take up drinking.

139
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,425
Okay, here you go, Leonard.
One Tequila Sunrise.

140
00:07:57,593 --> 00:07:58,685
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

141
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:02,592
This drink is an example of how liquids
with different specific gravities...

142
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,165
...interact in a cylindrical container.

143
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,695
Thank you.

144
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,667
Okay, Raj, what'll it be?

145
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:14,769
Whatever you recommend.

146
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:18,280
How about a Grasshopper?
I make a mean Grasshopper.

147
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,607
Okay? Good, coming up.

148
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:23,775
- Sheldon, what are you gonna have?
- I'll have a Diet Coke.

149
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,147
Okay, can you please order a cocktail?
I need to practice mixing drinks.

150
00:08:28,324 --> 00:08:31,851
Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba Libre.

151
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:35,997
That's rum and Coke without the rum.

152
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:37,655
Yes.

153
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,027
So Coke.

154
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:41,636
Yes.

155
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:44,472
And would you make it diet?

156
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:50,809
There's a can in the fridge.

157
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:55,415
A Cuba Libre traditionally comes
in a tall glass with a lime wedge.

158
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,710
Then swim to Cuba.

159
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,985
Bartenders are supposed
to have people skills.

160
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,853
Okay. Raj, here you go.

161
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,394
All right. Who's next?

162
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:11,294
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

163
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:18,099
Okay, you're cut off.

164
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:21,107
Anybody need a refill?

165
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,042
Where did my life go, Penny?

166
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:28,247
One day I'm a bachelor,
and the next I'm married...

167
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:32,786
...and driving a minivan to peewee cricket
matches in suburban New Delhi.

168
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,121
Are you talking to me?

169
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:38,924
Is there another Penny here?

170
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,558
I had such plans. I had dreams.

171
00:09:42,732 --> 00:09:46,133
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi
of particle astrophysics.

172
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:48,497
But with a penis, of course.

173
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,467
It's amazing.

174
00:09:51,641 --> 00:09:53,108
Ever since I was a little boy...

175
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,143
...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

176
00:09:56,312 --> 00:10:00,248
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

177
00:10:03,753 --> 00:10:07,086
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

178
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,723
It's time for a showdown.

179
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:11,018
Somebody give me a computer
with a Webcam.

180
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,289
Okay. Sweetie, I think
that's the Grasshopper talking.

181
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:16,931
It's about to tell my parents...

182
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,466
...that I'm not riding an elephant
down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.

183
00:10:20,636 --> 00:10:22,536
Okay, calm down.

184
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,900
No one can make you get married.

185
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,505
Why don't you meet this girl,
see what happens?

186
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,237
Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

187
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:33,681
- Raj...
- No, no, let's see how long it takes him.

188
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,313
Raj, honey...

189
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,921
...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

190
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,250
And now we'll never know.

191
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,619
You're right. L...

192
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,262
I am talking to you.

193
00:10:48,197 --> 00:10:50,791
Hello, Penny. How are you?

194
00:10:51,267 --> 00:10:52,529
I'm fine.

195
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,966
Okay, now, I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

196
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:57,128
...before I meet the Grasshopper.

197
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:03,106
It's a sweet green miracle.

198
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,612
If you're gonna drink on this date,
just promise me you won't overdo it.

199
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:08,313
Overdo what?

200
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,281
Happiness?

201
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,980
Freedom?

202
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:17,649
This warm glow inside of me that promises
everything's going to be all hunky dunky?

203
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,391
Yeah, that.

204
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,793
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

205
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,592
Okay.

206
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,867
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her,
he likes her, they get married.

207
00:11:29,038 --> 00:11:31,871
What's he gonna do,
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

208
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,271
It worked for my parents.

209
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:49,220
I can't believe I'm sitting here
next to little Lalita Gupta.

210
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,285
Well, you are.

211
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,553
Little Lalita.

212
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,253
That's kind of fun to say.

213
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:58,628
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

214
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,269
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

215
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:05,964
You have lost so much weight.

216
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,638
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

217
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,338
Do you remember?

218
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,951
- Yes, I do.
- Of course you do.

219
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,848
Who could forget being that fat?

220
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,216
Well, I've been trying.

221
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:24,686
- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

222
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,988
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,327
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

224
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:38,132
...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

225
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:40,241
Yay, me.

226
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,210
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

227
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,345
Drinks do not work that way.

228
00:12:47,116 --> 00:12:48,845
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

229
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,749
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

230
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:56,715
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

231
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,460
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

232
00:13:01,464 --> 00:13:04,194
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

233
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:08,296
- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

234
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,539
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

235
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:14,867
So how's Koothrappali...?

236
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,306
Oh, my Lord.

237
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,312
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

238
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,382
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

239
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,680
<i>No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.</i>

240
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:30,588
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

241
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,093
It's a children's story.

242
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:35,230
Oh, no, it isn't.

243
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,127
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

244
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,668
...my mother would read it.

245
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,898
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

246
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,067
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

247
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:52,408
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

248
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,577
I know the reason.

249
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:57,681
We all know the reason.

250
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,245
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

251
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:04,256
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

252
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:08,427
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

253
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,065
Every year at Comic-Con.

254
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:12,826
Every day at Disneyland.

255
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:15,527
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

256
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:18,332
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

257
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,205
Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

258
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,676
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

259
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,816
Isn't it great? She isn't fat anymore.

260
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,714
Forgive me, Your Highness...

261
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:32,581
...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

262
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:36,247
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

263
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:38,855
I'm sorry?

264
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:42,156
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

265
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,758
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

266
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:48,529
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

267
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,329
Oh.

268
00:14:50,573 --> 00:14:53,508
Us Indian or "come to our casino" Indian?

269
00:14:55,444 --> 00:14:57,105
- You Indian.
- Oh.

270
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,538
The resemblance is remarkable.

271
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:03,116
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

272
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,111
Well, thanks.

273
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:07,653
I imagine you smell very nice too.

274
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,619
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

275
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,990
Really? So do I.

276
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,155
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

277
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,395
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

278
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:24,369
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

279
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,567
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

280
00:15:28,744 --> 00:15:32,737
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

281
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,641
Oh, my.

282
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:36,808
- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

283
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:41,355
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

284
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,317
I'm not hitting on her.

285
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,057
And I am not your lady.

286
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,661
And you have no wrath.

287
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,359
You are my lady. Our parents said so.

288
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,001
We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

289
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,801
Let's get something straight.

290
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,963
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

291
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,905
I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

292
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:06,343
That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

293
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,779
- Screw Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

294
00:16:08,951 --> 00:16:10,475
But you're not Princess Panchali.

295
00:16:10,653 --> 00:16:13,019
Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

296
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:16,017
- Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.

297
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,085
Let's go.

298
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,621
What just happened?

299
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:24,527
Beats the hell out of me.

300
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,329
I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

301
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,306
<i>MRS. KOOTHRAPPALl: What are we
supposed to say to Lalita's parents?</i>

302
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,239
<i>I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.</i>

303
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,404
Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, Papa.

304
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,745
<i>Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.</i>

305
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,117
Dr. And Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

306
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,781
<i>- This is a family matter, Sheldon.
- No, I'm Leonard.</i>

307
00:16:51,026 --> 00:16:53,893
<i>Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.</i>

308
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,930
But he's right, Papa. Listen to him.

309
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:00,661
You, you are the one
who ruined everything.

310
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,394
<i>Who is it? We can't see.</i>

311
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,004
<i>Turn us. Turn us.</i>

312
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:10,111
Go ahead, tell my parents why
they won't have any grandchildren.

313
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:13,573
How would I know?
Do you have a low sperm count?

314
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,243
This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

315
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,115
<i>You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?</i>

316
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,313
Yes, Mommy.

317
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,085
<i>You know what happens to the samosas
when you wear the tighty whities.</i>

318
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:28,290
Can we please stop talking
about my testicles?

319
00:17:28,864 --> 00:17:31,594
- Sheldon, tell them what you did.
- What did I do?

320
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,661
You left with his date.

321
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:35,497
Friends don't do that to each other.

322
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:37,762
Oh.

323
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:39,700
All right, noted.

324
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,512
- Sorry.
- "Sorry"? That's all you can say is "sorry"?

325
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,875
Take it, Raj.
It's more than I've ever gotten.

326
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:48,073
And may I point out...

327
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,378
...she wouldn't have asked me to go
if you weren't drunk and boring.

328
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,750
<i>- Drunk?
- And boring. Her words.</i>

329
00:17:54,923 --> 00:17:57,687
<i>I knew it, he moves to America
and becomes an alcoholic.</i>

330
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,487
I'm not an alcoholic.

331
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,288
<i>Then why were you drunk?</i>

332
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:03,363
It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.

333
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,592
<i>Are you in denial? Do we have
to come over and do an intervention?</i>

334
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:09,203
<i>Don't embarrass him
in front of his friends.</i>

335
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,168
<i>All right. Carry us outside.</i>

336
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,535
<i>We want to talk to you in private.</i>

337
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,703
<i>- But, Papa, please...
- Now, Rajesh.</i>

338
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,581
I have to go.

339
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:26,980
<i>DR. KOOTHRAPPALl: Now, listen to me...
- At least wait till I get into the hall.</i>

340
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,584
Okay, well, good night.

341
00:18:32,594 --> 00:18:34,289
Hold on.

342
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,994
What happened with you and Lalita?

343
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:40,761
We ate, she lectured me on the link
between gum disease and heart attacks...

344
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:43,837
...nothing I didn't already know,
and I came home.

345
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:46,600
So you're not gonna see her again?

346
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,402
Why would I see her again?

347
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:51,045
I already have a dentist.

348
00:18:55,851 --> 00:18:59,753
I wonder who's gonna tell his parents
that they're not having grandchildren.

349
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:23,207
I don't believe it.
What's gotten into him?

350
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:28,406
Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba Libres
that turned out to be kind of slutty.

351
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:30,575
You didn't.

352
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,982
Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.

9999
