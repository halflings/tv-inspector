1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:03,917
<i>Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.</i>

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,251
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,020
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

4
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:18,157
<i>Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...</i>

5
00:00:18,334 --> 00:00:21,667
...it's an extremely private matter.
- I'd like to know the details.

6
00:00:21,838 --> 00:00:24,830
His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.

7
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,102
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,975
<i>...with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?</i>

9
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,313
<i>How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?</i>

10
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:41,116
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose. "

11
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,317
Hi. Can you help me?

12
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:46,792
I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.

13
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,625
Now it's just going, "Aaaah. "

14
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,127
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

15
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,466
Diet Coke.

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,707
And yogurt.

17
00:00:57,874 --> 00:00:59,136
And a little nail polish.

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,936
I'll take a look at it.

19
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,875
Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...

20
00:01:04,047 --> 00:01:06,982
...Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,015
...in the Physics Bowl this year.

22
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:12,052
- You're kidding. Why not?
- They formed a barbershop quartet...

23
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:15,385
...and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.

24
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:20,758
Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.

25
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,659
Recognize.

26
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,969
This is our year. With those guys out...

27
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:29,833
...the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

28
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,736
- Zod?
- Kryptonian villain. Long story.

29
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,240
Good story.

30
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:39,844
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

31
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,213
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

32
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:46,984
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

33
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:50,283
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,686
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

35
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:57,662
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

36
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,826
By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...

37
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,939
...and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.

38
00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:06,098
Tickets to that, please.

39
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,044
Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

40
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,306
No, don't.

41
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:14,912
"The needs of the many... "

42
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,109
"Outweigh the needs of the few... "

43
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:19,152
"Or the one. "

44
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:21,381
Damn it, I'll do it.

45
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,779
Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.

46
00:02:50,553 --> 00:02:53,989
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

47
00:02:54,157 --> 00:02:57,524
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

48
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:01,820
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.

49
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,995
- The ladies?
- Perpetual Motion Squad...

50
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,500
...we can go all night.

51
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,535
- I like it.
- I don't.

52
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:12,231
Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...

53
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:14,535
...thus intimidating one's opponent.

54
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,201
We could be the Bengal Tigers.

55
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,347
Poor choice. Gram for gram...

56
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:22,610
...no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.

57
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:27,450
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.

58
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,152
Let's put it to a vote.

59
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:34,159
- All those in favor...
- Point of order.

60
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,525
I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.

61
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:39,497
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...

62
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,161
...when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

63
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,672
Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?

64
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,677
- I will yield.
- After we go through the exercise...

65
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,940
...of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...

66
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,550
...does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?

67
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:59,085
- He does.
- We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?

68
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:04,485
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

69
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,686
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...

70
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,764
...I didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...

71
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,527
...and isn't that just a little sad?

72
00:04:14,103 --> 00:04:15,661
- Gentlemen, are you ready?
Yes.

73
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,931
Fire away.
- It's none of my business...

74
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:21,338
...but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?

75
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,207
Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

76
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,907
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

77
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:30,416
Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

78
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:34,018
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

79
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,988
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,060
"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"

81
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,797
- Dr. Cooper.
- Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.

82
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:46,026
- That is correct.
- I knew that too.

83
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,667
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.

84
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,400
"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"

85
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,076
- Howard?
- The answer is giant magnetoresistance.

86
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,306
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

87
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,043
And I answered. It's called teamwork.

88
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,282
Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.

89
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:13,286
By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.

90
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,098
Just ask another one.

91
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:18,392
Okay.

92
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,902
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"

93
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:26,400
And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.

94
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,306
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

95
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:31,777
- Why?
- Because it's polite.

96
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:35,743
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.

97
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,819
Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...

98
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,456
...to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

99
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:45,289
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

100
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,226
The objective is to give correct answers.

101
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,367
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

102
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,297
Some of us might have
the correct answers too.

103
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,200
- Please. You don't even have a Ph. D.
- All right, that's it.

104
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:59,671
- Howard, sit down.
- Okay.

105
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:04,138
- We should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

106
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,612
All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.

107
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,009
I agree.

108
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:11,210
What did he say?

109
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:16,353
He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...

110
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,154
...one might use on a summer's eve.

111
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,959
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

112
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,998
Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.

113
00:06:30,173 --> 00:06:32,038
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.

114
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,336
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

115
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,071
<i>The colors are based
on Star Trek: The Original Series.</i>

116
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:42,513
The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.

117
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:44,909
Why do they say "AA"?

118
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,647
Army Ants.

119
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:51,825
Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.

120
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:56,562
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

121
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:57,923
No, I meant...

122
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:00,895
Never mind.

123
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,765
Hey, check it out.

124
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,067
I got you a Batman cookie jar.

125
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:09,336
Oh, neat. What's the occasion?

126
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,606
Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...

127
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:14,272
...and you're off the team.

128
00:07:17,787 --> 00:07:19,015
What?

129
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,520
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

130
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,852
- You didn't.
- We did. I just came from there.

131
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,518
I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.

132
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,599
I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.

133
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:34,898
Okay, let me try it this way.

134
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:37,801
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...

135
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:41,705
...and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.

136
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,806
- Why?
- Because you're taking all the fun out of it.

137
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:49,941
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics Bowl
the team that has the most fun?

138
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,746
Okay. Let me try it this way.

139
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:55,618
You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.

140
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,055
I see.

141
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:05,394
Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...

142
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,935
...and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...

143
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:13,201
...and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

144
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:16,673
Thanks for the heads up.

145
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,109
You're welcome.

146
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:21,582
- One more thing.
- Yes?

147
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,776
It's on, bitch.

148
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,689
- So who did he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

149
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,699
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.

150
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:44,302
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.

151
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:47,135
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh like:

152
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,676
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.

153
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:51,472
But we are also smart and strong...

154
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:55,083
...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you. "

155
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:58,486
How exactly would that laugh go?

156
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:03,157
Hee-hee-hee!

157
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,650
That sounds more like:

158
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:10,356
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians. "

159
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,062
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

160
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:16,262
So?

161
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:18,931
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

162
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,734
Gentlemen.

163
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,243
Hee-hee-hee!

164
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,845
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

165
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:35,821
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

166
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,760
She got a Ph. D. In neuroscience
or something.

167
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:44,025
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

168
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,132
<i>How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?</i>

169
00:09:49,772 --> 00:09:53,503
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution
to all our problems.

170
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:57,607
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

171
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,372
Why? Because you slept together...

172
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:03,348
...and when she was done with you,
she discarded you like last night's chutney?

173
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,546
Yes.

174
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:13,284
- You gotta take one for the team.
- Yeah. Sack up, dude.

175
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,289
Fine.

176
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,860
Here I go, taking one for the team...

177
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,061
...in the sack.

178
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,637
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

179
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:29,141
Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...

180
00:10:29,312 --> 00:10:33,373
...and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

181
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,744
Hit that thing.

182
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:42,118
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

183
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:45,818
...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

184
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:51,163
There's not? Gee, because it sure sounds
like there should be.

185
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:55,767
Any aspects of our sexual relationship,
regarding your preferences...

186
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:59,374
...your idiosyncrasies, your performance,
are protected by the inherent...

187
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,636
...confidentiality of the bedroom.
- That's all very comforting...

188
00:11:02,812 --> 00:11:04,677
...but I'd like to get on my question now.

189
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,410
- Proceed.
- We are entering the Physics Bowl...

190
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,677
...and we need a fourth.
- No, thanks.

191
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:14,016
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

192
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,091
Dilepton shmylepton, we need you.

193
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,020
Sorry.

194
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,519
Well, we tried.

195
00:11:21,697 --> 00:11:26,031
<i>We'll just have to face Sheldon
mano y mano y mano a mano.</i>

196
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,466
Wait, you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

197
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,162
- Yes.
- That arrogant, misogynistic...

198
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,140
...doorknob that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

199
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:38,576
...for laundry and childbearing?

200
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,477
She's in.

201
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,551
So how do you feel?

202
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:49,714
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

203
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,922
- Are you ready?
Oh.

204
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:55,893
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

205
00:11:56,065 --> 00:11:58,761
Oh, no, no, I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

206
00:11:58,934 --> 00:11:59,958
Okay.

207
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,208
- Gentlemen.
- Sheldon.

208
00:12:07,376 --> 00:12:10,504
- Sheldon.
- Hee-hee-hee.

209
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,744
Sheldon.

210
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,217
I'm just gonna sit down.

211
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:22,515
So is that your team?

212
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:24,291
Actually, I don't need a team.

213
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,419
I could easily defeat you single-handedly,
but the rules require four.

214
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:32,897
So may I introduce the third-floor janitor,
the lady from the lunch room and...

215
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,970
My Spanish is not good.
- Either her son or her butcher.

216
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,834
And what about your team?

217
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,034
<i>What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?</i>

218
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:44,270
Hello, Sheldon.

219
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:47,973
Leslie Winkle.

220
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,641
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

221
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,550
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

222
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:58,655
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

223
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:02,628
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

224
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:06,029
...returns on its original trajectory,
and adheres to you.

225
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,996
Oh, ouch.

226
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:12,134
Okay, if everyone could please
take your seats?

227
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,015
Here's your T-shirt.

228
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,453
PMS?

229
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:28,681
It's a couple days early.

230
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:30,382
No.

231
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,255
It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

232
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:35,420
Oh, right, of course.
What was I thinking?

233
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:42,532
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

234
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,331
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

235
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:52,679
AA versus PMS.

236
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,839
All night long, y'all.

237
00:13:59,288 --> 00:14:02,416
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question.

238
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:07,927
For 10 points. "What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?"

239
00:14:09,365 --> 00:14:11,196
- PMS?
- The eta meson.

240
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,629
Correct.

241
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,095
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

242
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,400
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

243
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,544
Denied. All right, for 10 points.

244
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:26,579
"What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?"

245
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,109
- AA?
- And, of course, the answer is technetium.

246
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,015
Terrific.

247
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:35,949
Next question. "What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

248
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,956
...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?"

249
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,091
- PMS?
- And Sheldon can suck on...

250
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,128
...the Casimir effect.
Correct.

251
00:14:48,604 --> 00:14:51,437
"How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?"

252
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,400
- PMS?
- Shor's algorithm.

253
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:55,601
Correct.

254
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:02,948
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

255
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:05,052
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

256
00:15:05,254 --> 00:15:07,552
Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

257
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,588
Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

258
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,818
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

259
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,830
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

260
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,897
A sigma particle.

261
00:15:19,068 --> 00:15:22,469
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

262
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:24,265
Correct.

263
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,813
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

264
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:40,220
The score now stands,
AA, 1150, PMS, 1175.

265
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:43,722
So for 100 points and the match...

266
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:48,386
...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

267
00:15:48,564 --> 00:15:50,293
Solve the equation.

268
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,864
Holy crap.

269
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,497
What the hell is that?

270
00:15:56,672 --> 00:16:00,335
It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

271
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:04,172
- Come on, think. Leslie?
- It's not gonna work if you rush me.

272
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:08,146
- You have to let me get there.
- You are never gonna let that go, are you?

273
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:09,545
Ten seconds.

274
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,520
PMS?

275
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,718
Sorry, I panicked.

276
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,823
Then guess.

277
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:22,623
Um...

278
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:25,261
Eight.

279
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,399
Point four.

280
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:33,799
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

281
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:37,935
AA, if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

282
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,381
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

283
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,621
AA, I need your answer.

284
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,961
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

285
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,069
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

286
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:04,205
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

287
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:06,568
Winning Physics Bowl.

288
00:17:08,043 --> 00:17:10,011
How do you know anything
about physics?

289
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,582
Here, I am janitor.
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

290
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:16,881
Leningrad Politechnika.

291
00:17:17,386 --> 00:17:19,217
Go, Polar Bears.

292
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,648
That's a delightful little story.

293
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,090
Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

294
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,786
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

295
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,229
Hey, look. Now, maybe you have democracy
now in your beloved Russia...

296
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:35,268
...but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

297
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:36,734
Ow!

298
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:39,397
AA, I need your official answer.

299
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,634
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

300
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,971
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

301
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,340
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

302
00:17:45,514 --> 00:17:46,981
Informal protest.

303
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,342
Denied.

304
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:52,612
- I need your official answer.
- No, I decline to provide one.

305
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:56,087
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

306
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,993
That's your opinion.

307
00:18:02,197 --> 00:18:04,757
- All right, the winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

308
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:09,729
Sheldon, is proving you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important...

309
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:13,363
...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

310
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,844
I didn't understand the question.

311
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,771
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

312
00:18:58,787 --> 00:19:00,982
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

313
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,620
- Who?
- My Physics Bowl trophy.

314
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,661
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

315
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:12,892
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

316
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,400
My Physics Bowl trophy.

317
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,767
"Leonard is so smart.

318
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,603
- Sheldon who?"
- All right, that is just very immature.

319
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:22,937
You're right. I'm sorry.

320
00:19:23,111 --> 00:19:25,409
"I'm not!"

321
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,210
- Okay, new contest.
What are you doing?

322
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:33,548
I am settling, once and for all,
who is the smartest around here.

323
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,349
- Okay? Are you ready?
- Absolutely.

324
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:36,991
- Bring it on.
Okay.

325
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:41,790
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy were
the three daughters in what TV family?"

326
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,326
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

327
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,099
Okay.

328
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,106
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

329
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,812
The Brady Bunch?

330
00:20:02,918 --> 00:20:03,942
Van Halen.

331
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,116
All right. "Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum. "

332
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,655
Oh, my God. Sean Penn.

333
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:15,228
How do you know these things?

334
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,998
I go outside and I talk to people.

335
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,497
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record...

336
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:25,504
<i>...for being named People magazine's
Sexiest Man Alive?"</i>

337
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:28,399
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

338
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,076
I don't think it's Shatner.

339
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:34,511
Then it's gotta be Patrick Stewart.

340
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:40,153
- No.
- Formal protest.

341
00:20:41,723 --> 00:20:44,851
All right. "Singer who sang
'Oops! I Did It Again'?"

342
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:51,265
Okay.

343
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:54,932
"Tweety bird thought he saw a what?"

344
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:00,874
Romulan.

345
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,007
Yes. He thought he saw a Romulan.
