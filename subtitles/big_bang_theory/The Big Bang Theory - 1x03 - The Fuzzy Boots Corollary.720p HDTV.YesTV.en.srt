1
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:12,012
Alright, just a few more feet.

2
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:14,798
And... here we are, gentlemen,

3
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:16,786
the Gates of Elzebob.

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,473
Good Lord.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,783
Don't panic. This is what the
last 97 hours have been about.

6
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,375
Stay frosty. There's a horde
of armed goblins

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,595
on the other side of that gate
guarding the Sword of Asaroth.

8
00:00:27,942 --> 00:00:30,961
Warriors, unsheathe your weapons.
Magic wielders, raise your wands.

9
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:32,307
Lock and load.

10
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:33,938
Raj, blow the gates.

11
00:00:34,824 --> 00:00:36,080
Blowing the gates.

12
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:37,916
Control,

13
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:40,497
shift... B!

14
00:00:43,146 --> 00:00:45,286
Oh, my God, so many goblins!

15
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:48,112
Don't just stand there,
slash and move!

16
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,307
Stay in formation!

17
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:50,906
Leonard, you got one on your tail.

18
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:53,260
My tail's prehensile--
I'll swat him off.

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,554
I got him, Leonard.

20
00:00:54,674 --> 00:00:57,736
Tonight I spice my mead
with goblin blood.

21
00:00:58,389 --> 00:01:00,229
Raj, no, it's a trap!
They're flanking us!

22
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:01,994
He's got me!

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,592
Sheldon, he's got Raj.
Use your sleep spell!

24
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:09,727
I've got the Sword of Asaroth!

25
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,533
Forget the sword, help Raj!

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,203
There is no more Sheldon.
I am the sword master!

27
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:19,039
- Leonard, look out!
- Damn it, man, we're dying here!

28
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:20,624
Good-bye, peasants!

29
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:23,085
The bastard teleported!

30
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,265
He's selling the Sword
of Asaroth on eBay.

31
00:01:28,974 --> 00:01:31,286
You betrayed us for money?
Who are you?

32
00:01:31,623 --> 00:01:32,845
I'm a rogue night elf.

33
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,904
Don't you people read
character descriptions?

34
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,975
Wait, wait!
Somebody just clicked "Buy it now."

35
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:41,141
I am the sword master!

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Season 1 Episode 3:
The Fuzzy Boots Corollary

1
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm all sweaty.

2
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,800
Anybody want to log on
to Second Life and go swimming?

3
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,500
I just built a virtual pool.

4
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
No. I can't look at you
or your avatar right now.

5
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
Sounds like your neighbor's home.

6
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,300
Excuse me.

7
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,900
Don't forget the mail you took
accidentally on purpose

8
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,400
as an excuse to talk to her.

9
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Oh, right, right, right.

10
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,700
Stealing snail mail--
very old school. I like it.

11
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,300
Penny,
the mailman, did it again...

12
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Sorry.

13
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,100
Hi, Leonard.
This is Doug.

14
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Doug, this is my neighbor Leonard.

15
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,200
What's up, bro?

16
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
Not much...

17
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
bro.

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,000
Is everything okay?

19
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Yeah, no, I just...
I got your mail again. Here.

20
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,100
Thank you.
I've got to talk to that mailman.

21
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,500
Oh, no, that's probably not
such a good idea.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,800
Civil servants have
a documented propensity

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
to, you know, snap, so...

24
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,300
Okay. Well, thank you again.

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
No problem. Bye.

26
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,200
Oh, and bye... bro.

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,000
Penny for your thoughts.

28
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,700
What's the matter?

29
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
I'm fine.

30
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,500
Penny's fine.
The guy she's kissing is really fine.

31
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
Kissing, what kind of kissing?
Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
What is wrong with you?

33
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,900
I'm a romantic.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't tell me
that your hopeless infatuation

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,300
is devolving into pointless jealousy.

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm not jealous.
I'm just a little concerned for her.

37
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,600
I didn't like the look of the guy.

38
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
Because he looks better than you?

39
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,700
He was kind of dreamy.

40
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
At least now you can
retrieve the black box

41
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,400
from the twisted,
smoldering wreckage

42
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,200
that was once your fantasy of dating her

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,300
and analyze the data
so that you don't crash

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
into Geek Mountain again.

45
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
I disagree.

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,600
Love is not a sprint,
it's a marathon--

47
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,800
a relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,900
or hits you with
the pepper spray.

49
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm done with Penny.

50
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm going to be more realistic
and go after someone my own speed.

51
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,300
- Like who?
- I don't know...

52
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Olivia Geiger.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,200
The dietician at the cafeteria
with the limp and the lazy eye?

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
I don't think you have a shot there.

55
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,600
I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,200
Now given that winter is coming,

57
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,000
one can only assume
she's signaling sexual availability.

58
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,900
I don't know.
You guys work in the same lab.

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
- So?
- There are pitfalls.

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
Trust me, I know.

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,000
When it comes to
sexual harassment law,

62
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,600
I'm a bit of a self-taught expert.

63
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,400
If I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
it would just be for dinner.
I'm not going to walk into the lab,

65
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,400
ask her to strip naked
and dance for me.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, then you're probably okay.

67
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,500
- Hello, Leslie.
- Hi, Leonard.

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,300
I'd like to propose an experiment...

69
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
- Goggles, Leonard.
- Right.

70
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
I would like to propose an experiment.

71
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,300
Hang on.

72
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,600
I'm trying to see how long it
takes a 500-kilowatt

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
oxygen iodine laser to heat up
my Cup a' Noodles.

74
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,100
I've done it. About two seconds.
2.6 for minestrone.

75
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,600
Anyway, I was thinking more

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,900
of a bio-social exploration
with a neuro-chemical overlay.

77
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,700
Wait, are you asking me out?

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,700
I was going to characterize it
as the modification

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
of our
colleague-slash-friendship paradigm

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,800
with the addition
of a date-like component,

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,900
but we don't need to
quibble over terminology.

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
What sort of experiment?

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,600
There's a generally accepted
pattern in this area.

84
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,900
I would pick you up,
take you to a restaurant.

85
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,800
Then we would see a movie,
probably a romantic comedy

86
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,500
featuring the talents
of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.

87
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,300
Interesting.
And would you agree

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,900
that the primary way we would
evaluate either the success

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,400
or failure of the date would be

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,300
based on the biochemical reaction
during the good night kiss?

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,100
Heart rate,
pheromones, etc. Yes.

92
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,500
Why don't we just stipulate
that the date goes well

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,000
and move to the key variable?

94
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
- You mean kiss you now?
- Yes.

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,200
Can you define the
parameters of the kiss?

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,900
Close-mouthed but romantic.
Mint?

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,300
Thank you.

98
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
I count down from three?

99
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
No, I think it needs
to be spontaneous.

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,800
- What do you think?
- You proposed the experiment.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I think you should
present your findings first.

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Fair enough.

103
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
On the plus side,
it was a good kiss.

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,900
Reasonable technique,
no extraneous spittle.

105
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
On the other hand, no arousal.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,300
- None?
- None.

107
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,000
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

108
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
None at all?

109
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,900
Sheldon,
if you were a robot,

110
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,900
and I knew
and you didn't...

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,200
...would you want me to tell you?

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That depends.

113
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,600
When

114
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,300
I learn that I'm a robot...

115
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,200
will I be able to handle it?

116
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,100
Maybe-- although the history
of science fiction is not on your side.

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,100
Okay,
let me ask you this--

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,500
when I learn that I'm a robot,

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
would I be bound
by Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics?

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,100
You might be bound
by them right now.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,900
That's true.
Have you ever harmed a human being

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,300
or through inaction allowed
a human being to come to harm?

123
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,400
- Of course not.
- Have you ever harmed yourself

124
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
or allowed yourself to be harmed

125
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,600
except in cases where a human being
would have been endangered?

126
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,700
- Well, no.
- I smell robot.

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,900
Hey, what's going on?

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Internet's been down
for half an hour.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Also, Sheldon may be a robot.

130
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
So how'd it go with Leslie?

131
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,600
Oh, we tried kissing,
but the Earth didn't move.

132
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,800
I mean, any more than the 383 miles
that it was going to move anyway.

133
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,200
Oh, I've seen that look before.

134
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
This is just going to be
two weeks of moping

135
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,100
and tedious emo songs

136
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,100
and calling me to come down
to pet stores to look at cats.

137
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know if I can take it.

138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,600
You could power down.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,900
As usual, Wolowitz has the solution.

140
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,000
I happen to know a place

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,600
where there are plenty of eligible women
and Leonard could have his pick.

142
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,500
Remember the Latin hips.

143
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,700
Shoulders stay still, and...
we sway.

144
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,500
One, two, three...

145
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,500
...five, six, seven.

146
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,000
I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

147
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,100
I've been there.
You're in for a treat.

1
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Oh, good Lord.

2
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
God, that's a good song.

3
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,600
If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

4
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
Oh, I hope
that scratching post is for you.

5
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,400
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

6
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
There's a feline geneticist
in San Diego

7
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,700
who's developed the cutest
little hypoallergenic calicos.

8
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,000
- Listen to me...
- I've been thinking about names.

9
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm kind of torn between
Einstein, Newton

10
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,100
and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

11
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
Do you really think
you can satisfy your need

12
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,400
for a relationship with
a genetically altered cat?

13
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Maybe.

14
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,600
If it's a cute, little, cuddly cat.

15
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
Oh, come on. Leonard...

16
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,400
This is obviously about Penny.

17
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,100
It doesn't matter.

18
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,100
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

19
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Look,

20
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,200
I think that you have
as much of a chance

21
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
of having a sexual relationship
with Penny

22
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,300
as the Hubble Telescope
does of discovering

23
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,900
at the center of every black hole

24
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,800
is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

25
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,000
Nevertheless,

26
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,300
I do feel obligated
to point out to you

27
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,800
that she did not reject you.

28
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
You did not ask her out.

29
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
You're right.

30
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
I didn't ask her out.
I should ask her out.

31
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,400
No, no, that was not my point.

32
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,400
My point was don't buy a cat.

33
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,900
No, but you're right.

34
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,400
I should march over there
and ask her out.

35
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.

36
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,300
Good afternoon, Penny.
So, hi... hey.

37
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,900
I was wondering if you
had plans for dinner.

38
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,400
You mean dinner tonight?

39
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,900
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."

40
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,500
Technically it refers

41
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,900
to the largest meal of the day
whenever it's consumed.

42
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,100
So to clarify here,
by dinner I mean supper.

43
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,200
- Supper?
- Or dinner.

44
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go.
Or a different time.

45
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
6:30's great.

46
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Really?

47
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,300
- Great.
- I like hanging out with you guys.

48
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Us guys?

49
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,500
Yeah, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all's coming?

50
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
They...

51
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,500
might all be there.

52
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Or a subset
of them might be there.

53
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.

54
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
For example,
Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch.

55
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,300
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.

56
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,000
It's no fault of Quiznos--
they have a varied menu.

57
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,100
Okay, whatever.
It sounds like fun.

58
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Great.

59
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,900
- Did we say a time?
- 6:30.

60
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,700
- And that's still good?
- It's fine.

61
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,200
- 'Cause it's not carved in stone.
- No, 6:30's great.

62
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,100
I'll get my chisel.

63
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Why?

64
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,300
To... carve the...
I'll see you at 6:30.

65
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
How do I look?

66
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
Could you be more specific?

67
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

68
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,400
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

69
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,700
- What time is your date?
- 6:30.

70
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
Perfect. That gives you

71
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
two hours and 15 minutes
for that dense molecular cloud

72
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,300
of Aramis to dissipate.

73
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
Is it too much?

74
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,500
Not if you're a rugby team.

75
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
If it should ever come up,

76
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,900
you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself

77
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,800
with a chicken carbonara sub
at Quiznos.

78
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,400
Why would I join you?

79
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
No reason.

80
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
You know what,
maybe this isn't such a good idea.

81
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
No, well, now there's
always the possibility

82
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,700
that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part

83
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,200
might lead to a nice
romantic evening.

84
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,900
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment--
it could go well.

85
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,400
There is the other
possibility,  that...

86
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
this date kicks off
a rather unpleasant 6 months

87
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,600
of the two of you passing
awkwardly in the hall,

88
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,200
until one of you breaks down and
moves to another zip code.

89
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,100
You could've stopped
at "it could go well."

90
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,900
If I could've, I would've.

91
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,300
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.

92
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,800
There's no reason we couldn't go
and have a lovely dinner,

93
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
maybe take a walk afterwards,

94
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,600
talk about things we have in common.

95
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
You love pottery?
I love pottery!

96
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,600
There's a pause,

97
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
we both know what's happening.
I lean in, we kiss.

98
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,100
It's a little tentative at first,
but then I realize

99
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,400
she's kissing me back.
She's biting my lower lip!

100
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
She wants me!
This thing is going the distance!

101
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,000
We're going to have sex!
Oh, God, oh, my God!

102
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
Is the sex starting now?

103
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm having a panic attack.

104
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,000
Well then... calm down.

105
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,500
If I could,
I wouldn't be having a panic...

106
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,400
That's why they call it a panic attack.

107
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
Sit down.

108
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.

109
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,600
- Why?
- Just do it.

110
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,000
Now try to increase
your alpha wave activity.

111
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,100
- What?!
- It's a biofeedback technique.

112
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
It's relaxation through
brain wave manipulation.

113
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,900
I read a paper about it
in Journal of American Neuroscience.

114
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It was a little sparsely sourced,
but I think the basic science is valid.

115
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,600
I probably have it here somewhere.

116
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,400
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.

117
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,000
You need to call her and cancel.

118
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,200
- Me?
- Yes.

119
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
- What should I tell her?
- I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.

120
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,400
Not an illness that will make her
want to take care of me,

121
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
but nothing so critical
that she'll feel uncomfortable

122
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,000
going out with me
if I want to try this again.

123
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,600
Got it.
So I'm assuming nothing venereal?

124
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,700
I'll just tell her
that you had a routine colonoscopy

125
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
and haven't quite bounced back.

126
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,500
- Give me the phone.
- I thought you wanted to cancel.

127
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,300
I can't, because if I don't show up
she'll still be expecting you.

128
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
Why would she be expecting me?

129
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,800
Stop asking me all these questions.

130
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,800
I need to take another shower.

131
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
So are the rest of the guys
meeting us here?

132
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
Oh, yeah... no.

133
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,300
It turns out that Raj
and Howard had to work, and Sheldon...

134
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,000
had a colonoscopy and he hasn't
quite bounced back yet.

135
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,900
My uncle just had a colonoscopy.

136
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
You're kidding.

137
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,700
Then that's something
we have in common.

138
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
How?

139
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,200
We both have people
in our lives who...

140
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
want to nip intestinal polyps
in the bud.

141
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
So what's new in
the world of physics?

142
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Nothing.

143
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,000
Really? Nothing?

144
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,000
Well, with the exception
of string theory,

145
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,700
not much has happened
since the 1930s.

146
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,500
And you can't prove string theory.

147
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,900
At best you can say,

148
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,700
"Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."

149
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Well, I'm sure things will pick up.

150
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

151
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,800
Not much.

152
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,200
We do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

153
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,700
Good.

154
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Good.

155
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
What about your...

156
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,800
hallway friend?

157
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,600
Doug?
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

158
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,900
I mean, you know,
he's nice and funny, but...

159
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,900
Can I get you started with some drinks?

160
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,400
- You were saying? But...
- I'd like a drink.

161
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,900
Just say the "but" thing about Doug
and then I'll get her back.

162
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,400
I don't know, it's just me.

163
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm still getting over
this breakup with Kurt

164
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,500
and this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

165
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,300
Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

166
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,500
It's just... it's my pattern.

167
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,900
I break up,
then I find some cute guy,

168
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,100
and then it's just 36
meaningless hours of...

169
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,900
you know.

170
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm not sure that I do.

171
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
Is that one 36-hour experience,

172
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,600
or is that 36 hours
spread out over, say...

173
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,700
one glorious summer?

174
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,900
No, it's usually over a weekend,

175
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,600
and trust me, you do not feel
good after it.

176
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, chafing, right?

177
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,700
Emotionally.

178
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,000
Of course, yeah,
emotional chafing.

179
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,300
Do you want to see something cool?

180
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,800
I can make this olive
go into this glass

181
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,400
without touching it.

182
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,900
- How?
- Physics.

183
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
Centrifugal force.

184
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,300
Actually, it's centripetal force,

185
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
which is an inward force
generated by the glass

186
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,600
acting on the olive...

187
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,000
Excuse me.

188
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,100
If you were riding
on the olive,

189
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame

190
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,900
and would...

191
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

192
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,800
Did you spill ketchup?

193
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
- No.
- I'm not okay.

1
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,600
You sure you don't want to go
to the emergency room?

2
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
No, I'm okay.
It stopped bleeding.

3
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,400
I know, but you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

4
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,600
Yes.
But I get car sick, too, so...

5
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Sorry about
your car, by the way.

6
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,100
It's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

7
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,800
The poor guy on the bike.

8
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,100
I had a nice time.

9
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,700
Yeah, me, too.

10
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Well, um, good night.

11
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,100
Good night.

12
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Was this supposed to be a date?

13
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,900
This?

14
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
No.

15
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
Of course not.
This was just you and me

16
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,100
hanging out with a bunch of guys
who didn't show up

17
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,400
'cause of work and a colonoscopy.

18
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,700
Okay, I was just checking.

19
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
When I take a girl on a date--

20
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,300
and I do--

21
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,500
she knows she's been dated.

22
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,500
Capital D.

23
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,100
Boldface. Underlined.
Da...ted.

24
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,000
I think I might have
a little concussion.

25
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,600
I'm gonna go lie down for a while.
Good night.

26
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
So, how was your date?

27
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Awesome!

28
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,500
Score 1 for liquor and poor jugement.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
