1
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:09,049
Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:13,729
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:15,660
Assuming a device could be invented...

4
00:00:15,832 --> 00:00:19,495
...which would identify the state of matter
of an individual in one location...

5
00:00:19,669 --> 00:00:22,502
...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

6
00:00:22,672 --> 00:00:24,936
...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:30,239
...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

8
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:33,441
How about that.

9
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,877
I would never use a transporter.

10
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:38,714
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

11
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:41,618
...in order to create a new Sheldon.

12
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:46,153
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

13
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,361
No, he would be exactly the same.

14
00:00:49,532 --> 00:00:51,432
That is a problem.

15
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,829
So you see it too?

16
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,930
Dr. Hofstadter, Dr. Cooper.

17
00:00:56,106 --> 00:00:57,300
Dr. Gablehauser.

18
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,840
Gentlemen,
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

19
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,842
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

20
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:05,139
We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

21
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,580
- Graduate work, very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

22
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:12,620
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

23
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:16,281
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

24
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,459
Advantage, Kim.

25
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,057
I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

26
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:27,601
Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

27
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:28,795
I know you're not.

28
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:32,305
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

29
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:35,035
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

30
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:38,942
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

31
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:42,141
Well, obviously, you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

32
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:46,513
Dennis, we've discussed this.

33
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,055
We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

34
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:51,386
We welcome your input
on our research goals.

35
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,121
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

36
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:57,664
...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

37
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:01,462
We want him here, boys.

38
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:03,105
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:03,273 --> 00:02:05,138
You can count on us. We're on it.

40
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,572
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

41
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,946
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

42
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,446
...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

43
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:14,640
In addition...

44
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,183
Ooh, look, chocolate milk.

45
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,090
I sense a disturbance in the force.

46
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:25,557
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

47
00:02:51,054 --> 00:02:52,817
So how long have you been in America?

48
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,456
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

49
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:57,855
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

50
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,698
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

51
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:05,230
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:08,269
That.

53
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:09,935
He's not wrong.

54
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,238
All right, and this is my office.

55
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,809
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

56
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:18,938
Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

57
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,744
All right, this is my desk.
These are my books.

58
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,683
This is my door.
Please close it behind you, goodbye.

59
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:30,189
You're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,854
- Keen observation, goodbye.
- You see where you went wrong, don't you?

61
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,229
- Leonard.
- Ha.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,198
- Yeah?
- Get him out.

63
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,098
Come, I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

64
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,037
Do I look like I lift weights?

65
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,643
Not heavy ones.

66
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:53,680
It's startling you haven't considered
a Lorentz invariant or field theory approach.

67
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,209
You think I haven't considered it?

68
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:59,651
- You really think I haven't considered it?
- Have you considered it?

69
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,450
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

70
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,424
I'll show you the radiation lab.

71
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,856
Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

72
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:13,134
Yes. In fact,
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

73
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,630
Really? How old?

74
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,136
Fourteen and a half.

75
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:19,400
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

76
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:25,714
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror, isn't it?

77
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,682
Mm. This is really delicious, isn't it?

78
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,058
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

79
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,194
Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.

80
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,831
Hey, I'm damaged too.

81
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:51,371
How about a hug for Howie?

82
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,738
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

83
00:04:58,948 --> 00:05:00,438
Something you'd like to share?

84
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,883
A tale of woe perhaps?

85
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,718
Fifteen years old.

86
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,722
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

87
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,760
Today, I went
from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to...

88
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,363
You know, that other guy.

89
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:16,623
Antonio Salieri?

90
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,128
Oh, God,
now even you're smarter than me.

91
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:25,740
You know, you don't have so many friends
that you can afford to start insulting them.

92
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,741
Just eat, Sheldon. You'll feel better.

93
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,139
Why waste food?

94
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:32,713
When a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it...

95
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:36,215
...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

96
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:40,419
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

97
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,886
You can't let this kid get to you.

98
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:46,495
You knew that someday, someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

99
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,358
Yes, but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

100
00:05:49,532 --> 00:05:53,059
And that there'd be an asterisk
by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

101
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,737
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

102
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:02,037
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

103
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:06,743
I don't understand, exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

104
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,847
We liked Leonard.

105
00:06:11,587 --> 00:06:13,350
What are you gonna do, just give up?

106
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:18,623
Yes, it's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work is invalidated...

107
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,593
...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

108
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:26,725
He ceases his fruitless efforts,
he donates his body to scientific research...

109
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,428
...and he waits to die.

110
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:35,475
I'm confused again. Is he waiting, or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

111
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,877
- Hey.
- Hey.

112
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,448
I've decided you're right.

113
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:43,778
- My career is not over.
- Great.

114
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:46,979
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

115
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,624
...I just have to find
something else to focus on.

116
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:50,952
Great.

117
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:53,721
So I've decided
I'm going to collaborate with you.

118
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,457
Great.

119
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:00,465
So, what exactly is it you do?

120
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:05,531
I know you chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

121
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:09,472
Right now, I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

122
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:12,375
...of cosmic radiation at sea level,
but I don't need help.

123
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,573
Oh, sure you do.

124
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:17,713
Now see, what's this here in the schematic,
a laser array?

125
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,582
- Yes.
- Now, hmm...

126
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:25,985
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

127
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,488
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

128
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,489
- Pretty sure.
- "Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

129
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:35,433
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

130
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:37,465
Okay.

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,666
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career crisis.

132
00:07:40,843 --> 00:07:44,677
You're searching for some other area
where you can feel valuable and productive.

133
00:07:44,847 --> 00:07:47,372
But I need to tell you something,
and listen carefully.

134
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,849
- All right.
- Go away.

135
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,956
If you're concerned about sharing credit
with me, your name can go first... I'm going.

136
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:04,198
It's a small brown paper bag, Ma.

137
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:07,302
I'm looking at it right now.

138
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,166
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

139
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:18,207
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

140
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,743
So this is Engineering, huh?

141
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,046
I'll talk to you later.

142
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,951
Engineering,
where the noble semiskilled laborers...

143
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,991
...execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

144
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,253
Hello, Oompa Loompas of science.

145
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,632
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

146
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,059
I just came by to say hello.

147
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:43,899
For three years,
you've never come by to say hello.

148
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:46,564
Well, up until now,
I've had better things to do.

149
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,634
So, what are we making today?

150
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:54,044
A small payload support structure for
a European science experimental package...

151
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:57,744
...that's going up on the next space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

152
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,047
It will be attached to the payload bay...

153
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:03,784
...and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.

154
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,421
Ah-ha.

155
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:08,363
So it's a shelf.

156
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,560
No, you don't understand.

157
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:16,000
During acceleration, it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide...

158
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,605
Yeah, okay, it's a shelf.

159
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:19,865
I notice you're using titanium.

160
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,408
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

161
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:25,513
They're lighter, cheaper
and have twice the tensile strength.

162
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:31,278
Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office
that says I have a master's in engineering.

163
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,288
And you also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula. "

164
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:40,960
But neither of those is a cogent argument
for titanium over nanotubes.

165
00:09:41,697 --> 00:09:42,959
- Sheldon.
- Yes?

166
00:09:43,132 --> 00:09:45,293
Go away.

167
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,459
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

168
00:09:48,037 --> 00:09:49,800
No, I thought of it all by myself.

169
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,841
Huh? Can't be a coincidence.

170
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,469
There must be some causal link
I'm missing.

171
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:03,844
Go away.

172
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,326
Curiouser and curiouser.

173
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,231
- Is he here?
- Lf he were, I wouldn't be.

174
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,703
You know what he did?
He watched me work...

175
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:29,368
...and then started to design a simple piece
of software that could replace me.

176
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,779
Is that even possible?

177
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,812
As it turns out, yes.

178
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,111
- Something's gotta be done about him.
- Like what?

179
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,552
He'll never cope with the fact
that some 15-year-old is smarter...

180
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,419
...and more accomplished than he is.

181
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,187
What if something were to happen to him
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

182
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,200
Then our problem would be solved.

183
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,598
Hang on,
are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim?

184
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:58,772
I'm not saying no.

185
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,110
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means.

186
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,102
We can't send him back to North Korea.

187
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:06,509
He knows how to get out.

188
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:12,351
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

189
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:15,388
It won't happen.
He is not interested in anything but physics.

190
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:17,287
- What about biology?
- What?

191
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,452
You know, biology.

192
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:23,530
The one thing that can completely derail
a world-class mind.

193
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,758
- Howard, he's 15.
- Yeah, so?

194
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,698
When I was 15, I met Denise Palmeri...

195
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,966
...and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

196
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,403
She was sleeping with you?

197
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:38,506
No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

198
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:41,282
Oh, good, you're all here.

199
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:45,716
I've decided that if the three of you drop
whatever you're working on and join me...

200
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:50,416
...we could lick cold fusion
in less than a decade, 12 years tops.

201
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:53,652
Go away?

202
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,326
Hmm.

203
00:11:57,867 --> 00:11:58,891
Could it be me?

204
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,163
Hey, guys, what's up?

205
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,776
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

206
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:10,338
- What?
- Howard, that's racist.

207
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:14,176
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

208
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,946
It's possible
she may have misunderstood us.

209
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:31,794
- Dr. Cooper. Oh, are we interrupting?
- No, no, please come in.

210
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,435
I think you'll appreciate this.
This is very exciting.

211
00:12:34,603 --> 00:12:36,798
- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

212
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:41,306
Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize
in Physics have disappeared... Thank you.

213
00:12:41,477 --> 00:12:44,913
- I've decided to refocus my efforts
and use my people skills...

214
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,570
...to win the Nobel Peace Prize.

215
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,217
Look, I'm going
to solve the Middle East crisis...

216
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:54,220
...by building an exact replica of Jerusalem
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

217
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,881
To what end?

218
00:12:56,058 --> 00:13:00,461
You know, it's like the baseball movie.
"Build it and they will come. "

219
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,254
Who will come?

220
00:13:02,431 --> 00:13:04,296
The Jewish people.

221
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,729
What if they don't come?

222
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:07,732
We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

223
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:11,103
Okay, well, speaking of spreads...

224
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,174
...we're having a welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim...

225
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:18,245
...who's agreed to join us at the university.
- Of course he has.

226
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:22,441
The oracle told us little Neo was the one.

227
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:25,278
You can see the matrix, can't you?

228
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:30,221
Okay, well, obviously, you're very busy
with your, ah, um...

229
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,416
Come, Dennis.

230
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:37,161
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of, um...

231
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,494
He's nuts.

232
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:49,205
<i>They'll come, they'll settle
And I'll win the prize</i>

233
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,642
I don't understand your objections,
Professor Goldfarb.

234
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:57,445
Why wouldn't the Sonora Desert
make a perfectly good Promised Land?

235
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,710
Go away.

236
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,686
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

237
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:06,017
Please go away.

238
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,290
Said Pharaoh to Moses.

239
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,524
Why are all these young women here?

240
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,532
It's Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

241
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,628
Really? I was not aware of that.

242
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:19,103
Oh, yes.
There was a very official e-mail...

243
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,869
...that was sent to everyone
whose files indicated...

244
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,877
...they had daughters
between the ages of 14 and 16.

245
00:14:25,214 --> 00:14:26,238
Hmm.

246
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:28,474
- Smooth.
- Thank you.

247
00:14:29,818 --> 00:14:32,787
There's the man of the hour.

248
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:37,792
So we have a socially awkward genius in
a room of attractive age-appropriate women.

249
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,689
All he has to do is hook up with one.

250
00:14:48,671 --> 00:14:52,004
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

251
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:53,907
We need a social catalyst.

252
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,978
Like what?
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

253
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,081
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

254
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,119
I don't think you mean we can't.
I think you mean we shouldn't.

255
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,948
Hey, Howard, you're a Jew.

256
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:10,353
If there was another Wailing Wall
exactly like the one in Jerusalem...

257
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:13,222
...but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs...

258
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:15,056
...would you still wail at it?

259
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,463
Okay, it's definitely me.

260
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,138
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl...

261
00:15:24,306 --> 00:15:26,536
...and figure out
how to get her with Dennis.

262
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,533
How about that one?

263
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,439
Uh-uh. I know the type. Cheerleader,
student council, goes out with jocks.

264
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,777
Won't look at anybody
in the gifted program.

265
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,681
If she does agree to go out,
it turns out to be a setup.

266
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,722
You're in your mom's car with your pants off
while the whole football team laughs.

267
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:49,719
- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

268
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:52,063
Okay. Uh...

269
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,259
Oh, hey, how about her?

270
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,666
Sure, if he wants to spend years
doing her homework...

271
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,071
...while she drinks herself into a stupor
with nonfat White Russians.

272
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:03,643
And you're holding her head
while she's puking...

273
00:16:03,812 --> 00:16:06,007
...and wishes
more guys were like you.

274
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:08,547
She gets into Cornell,
because you wrote her essay.

275
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,915
And you drive up to visit her one weekend
and she acts like she doesn't know you.

276
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,254
Okay, so not her either.

277
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:20,292
How about her?

278
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:24,330
Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

279
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,592
I think that's our girl.

280
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,360
One of us should go talk to her.

281
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,333
I can't talk to her, you do it.

282
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,473
I can't just go up and talk to her.

283
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,800
Howard, you talk to her.

284
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:37,339
I don't know, she'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

285
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,107
In India, this would be simpler.

286
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:44,480
Five minutes with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

287
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,348
Well, we're not in India.

288
00:16:46,522 --> 00:16:48,285
Why don't we do it your way, then?

289
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:53,827
We'll arrange for her to move in across the
hall so he can pathetically moon over her.

290
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,096
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

291
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,796
Could I have everyone's attention,
please?

292
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,837
What a wonderful occasion this is.

293
00:17:06,008 --> 00:17:09,375
And how fortunate that it should
fall on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

294
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:14,874
We're here to welcome Mr. Dennis Kim
to our little family.

295
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,314
Welcome, Dennis Kim.

296
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:22,121
Mr. Kim was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University...

297
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:27,593
...he is also the youngest recipient
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

298
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,163
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up.

299
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,933
And now, without any further ado...

300
00:17:33,102 --> 00:17:38,734
...let me introduce the man of the hour,
Mr. Dennis Kim.

301
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:42,777
Dennis? Dennis.

302
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,106
What?

303
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,577
Would you like to tell us
about your upcoming research?

304
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,948
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

305
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,594
The kid got a girl.

306
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,724
Unbelievable.

307
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:05,389
Did anyone see how he did it?

308
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,568
Don't worry, I've got this.

309
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:11,695
Ladies and gentlemen,
honored daughters...

310
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:15,037
...while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naiveté...

311
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,509
...has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact...

312
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,480
...let me step in and assure you
that my research will go on uninterrupted.

313
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:27,782
And that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

314
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:29,549
Thank you.

315
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:34,554
- He's back.
- Yeah, mission accomplished.

316
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,961
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

317
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,895
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

318
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,162
Smart is the new sexy.

319
00:18:43,972 --> 00:18:46,941
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

320
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,001
Maybe we're too smart.

321
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,975
So smart, it's off-putting.

322
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,805
Yeah, let's go with that.
