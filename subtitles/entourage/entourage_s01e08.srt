1
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,085
Were you going to say goodbye?

2
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:10,685
Yeah, I was going to call you tonight.
I swear.

3
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,860
Should I come visit you in New York?

4
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:15,559
Can you? That'd be great.

5
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:17,693
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

6
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:27,837
I gotta go. The guys are waiting.

7
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,606
Give Philly a kiss for me.

8
00:01:30,783 --> 00:01:33,308
I can't believe you remembered
my dog's name.

9
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,683
It's my favorite terrier.

10
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,985
Let's hit it.

11
00:01:42,862 --> 00:01:46,821
E, remind me to call Charlotte, also.
She'll kill me if I don't say goodbye.

12
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,833
- You should call Jamie, too.
- I know.

13
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,630
Make a list so you don't forget anyone.

14
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,705
- That's what I do.
- That's a good idea.

15
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,773
- E, make me a list?
- Turtle, make a list.

16
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:56,671
You know Vince can't read my handwriting.

17
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,108
- God! You're useless.
- Says you.

18
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:01,772
- Did you cancel the newspapers?
- You gotta tell me first.

19
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,508
You gotta learn to anticipate, Turtle.

20
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:04,742
There's a chain of command.

21
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:07,046
I'm a soldier. I wait for orders.

22
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:08,381
He's right.

23
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,216
What happened to your delegation skills?

24
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:13,554
You had 10 waiters underneath you.
Can't you handle one little Turtle?

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,185
Instead of being an asshole,
you should be pissed at him.

26
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:19,025
My life is too good
to be worried about shit like this.

27
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:22,329
So where are we at
with Scarlett Johansson?

28
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,867
- Where are we at?
- Yes. Where are we at?

29
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:26,461
I told you to hook me up with her.

30
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,903
I told you I don't know her.

31
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:30,874
Find her. If I had your job,
it'd been done already.

32
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:32,308
Scarlett Jo?

33
00:02:32,845 --> 00:02:36,246
<i>I had a little
Lost In Translation moment myself...</i>

34
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,817
<i>when I was doing
that TNT movie Summerfall.</i>

35
00:02:39,085 --> 00:02:40,882
Isolated from the rest of the world...

36
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:44,184
just me and this little beauty,
Lauren Jennings.

37
00:02:44,857 --> 00:02:46,290
They shot that movie in Pasadena.

38
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:47,882
Yeah, but I didn't have a car.

39
00:02:47,994 --> 00:02:49,689
Back in the real world...

40
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:51,763
Vince, are we gonna throw
a going-away party?

41
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,525
Vince, we got to do something crazy.

42
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,124
Wahlberg spent $500,000 on his bash...

43
00:02:56,235 --> 00:02:57,827
<i>before he left for The Italian Job.</i>

44
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,700
Wahlberg made $10 million for that movie.

45
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,172
Vince is making $60,000
before taxes and commissions.

46
00:03:02,275 --> 00:03:04,402
I don't understand
why you couldn't get me more.

47
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,875
I don't make your deals, Vince.

48
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,809
Can I run with this party, Vince?

49
00:03:07,914 --> 00:03:10,109
- E?
- I'm not running with it.

50
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,812
Run, Turtle. Run.

51
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,881
Who you gonna invite to the party, E?
Emily or Kristen?

52
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:22,528
I say invite them both. Let them duke it out
in a steel-cage match, winner takes all.

53
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:26,157
My money's on Kristen.
She'll knock the crap out of Emily.

54
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,426
I don't know. I saw Emily at Tae-Bo.

55
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,968
She was looking pretty feisty.
What do you think, E?

56
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,594
I think you guys are assholes.

57
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:34,195
Come on, man, it'd be hot.

58
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,670
I like cute little Emily.

59
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,800
- Then again, Kristen looks...
- Shut up, Drama.

60
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,877
Jesus.

61
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,378
Vince, who would you rather bang,
Kristen or Emily?

62
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:42,448
Don't answer that, Vince.

63
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:43,537
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:43,649 --> 00:03:45,446
I kinda like them both.

65
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,916
E, you should feel good.

66
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,681
Movie star Vince Chase
would bang both your broads.

67
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:51,450
I do. I feel really blessed.

68
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,122
Three months in New York.
What's wrong with that, right?

69
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,591
It's not all it's cracked up to be, though.

70
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:01,292
Running errands, sitting on the set,
getting coffee? I'm not into it.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,927
I put this fucking movie together.
I get treated like a glorified gofer.

72
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:09,234
You know, when I went to the reunion,
people would come up to me and say:

73
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:13,234
"So what are you doing?"
And I'd say, "I'm Vince's guy."

74
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:15,371
Are you here to talk about business?

75
00:04:15,648 --> 00:04:17,616
No, I'm here to talk about us.

76
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:19,275
It's kinda the same thing, right?

77
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:22,149
No, not to me it isn't.
You know what your problem is?

78
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:25,347
No, but I have a feeling you do. So tell me.

79
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,391
You are addicted to Vince.

80
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,655
Great. More textbook psychobabble.
Come on, let's hear it.

81
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:32,594
When you're around him, you feel great.

82
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,893
But when you're not,
you go through withdrawal...

83
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:38,698
and you talk about quitting all the time.
Classic addiction symptoms.

84
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:40,669
So, what, this is all my fault?

85
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,840
No. I think you're both
fucked-up codependents.

86
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,740
What about us? What are we?

87
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,042
We're a couple.

88
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:51,680
Maybe we're not.

89
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:57,922
No, really, I'm just completely disgusted.

90
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:02,191
You call me and say we're going
to go to the game on the 21st.

91
00:05:02,562 --> 00:05:05,292
I'm waiting for your phone call.
I call your office.

92
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:07,923
I don't get a call back.
Then I turn on the TV...

93
00:05:08,034 --> 00:05:10,093
and I see you sitting next to Vin Diesel.

94
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:12,728
- So what the hell is that?
- I told Emily to call you.

95
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,831
She didn't call you. She fucked up.
My Blackberry was broken.

96
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,376
Wait a second, I called her, okay?

97
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:21,002
She gave you that message,
and you never called me back.

98
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:24,810
I was gonna go to the game with you.
I told Emily that we were gonna be late.

99
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:26,714
Okay? I went to go talk to Vin.

100
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:29,219
He's got an 18-wheeler with equipment
and going crazy.

101
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:30,619
They're making power shakes.

102
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:32,350
He's got the fucking crazy glasses on.

103
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,686
I don't know what's happening.

104
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,421
- I told Emily to call you.
- What language are you talking?

105
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,928
You thought... Is this an excuse?

106
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:41,193
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- It's exactly what happened.

107
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,325
I still don't know. You're talking Chinese.

108
00:05:43,436 --> 00:05:45,097
I'm not talking Chinese.

109
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:47,229
Larry, how you doing?
Good to see you, pal.

110
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,332
- Johnny Drama.
- Yeah. Remember me?

111
00:05:50,443 --> 00:05:52,070
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Hey, Ari.

112
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:53,145
Hey.

113
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,939
- This whole thing?
- You like that?

114
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:56,947
- You don't like it?
- It's okay.

115
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,950
- How's the show going? Good?
- Yeah.

116
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:02,114
Any good parts in there?

117
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:07,793
- Maybe.
- That's great.

118
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,451
So, we will speak,
and I will take you to a game.

119
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:12,258
- Okay. All right.
- All right?

120
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,834
- Bye, Lar.
- Larry, let's talk.

121
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,164
Don't ever fucking harass a real client again.

122
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:20,534
I know the guy.

123
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,038
Ari! Come on.

124
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,239
There he is. Johnny!

125
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:28,773
Sorry I'm late.

126
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:31,315
- How you doing, you good?
- Yeah.

127
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:34,011
Why don't you come back to the office?

128
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,017
Just tell me the deal's done.

129
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,421
Basically, they don't have enough money
to pay for your flight.

130
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:40,753
Or your room.

131
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:42,986
Per diem?

132
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,858
I know you're excited about this movie.
It's a good little part.

133
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,559
But here's the thing.

134
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:52,866
I got you an audition
for a guest-starring role in a pilot.

135
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,834
- A pilot that's all but on the air.
- Yeah, what's it called?

136
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:59,207
<i>CSI: Minneapolis.</i>

137
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:00,669
Don Johnson...

138
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,941
playing William Peterson,
playing David Caruso...

139
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,243
playing the Gary Sinise role.

140
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,647
Sounds great.

141
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:09,312
It's like $10,000,
plus first-class airfare and expenses.

142
00:07:09,455 --> 00:07:11,980
- To Minneapolis.
- No, it shoots in Vancouver.

143
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:14,753
<i>Now, the dates conflict
with Queens Boulevard...</i>

144
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,452
and there's no flexibility.

145
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,190
Shit. When it rains, it pours.

146
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,691
Do you think I got a shot at this?

147
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,269
You're Johnny Drama.

148
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,865
You always got a shot.

149
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,137
<i>When I played that cokehead stoolie
on Miami Vice...</i>

150
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,302
I remember right after a take,
Don Johnson said, "Nice job, kid."

151
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,007
- Or was it the black guy?
- What's the pay?

152
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:38,808
<i>A lot more than Queens Boulevard.</i>

153
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,648
Plus first-class accommodations,
fat per diem.

154
00:07:41,821 --> 00:07:43,015
That's a tough choice.

155
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:45,249
What are you saying? No, it's not.

156
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:49,692
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll put you up
in New York, and I'll double your per diem.

157
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:52,320
My baby brother's
not putting me up anywhere.

158
00:07:52,498 --> 00:07:55,467
<i>Come on, Drama. New Jack City.</i>

159
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,262
Room service, escorts.

160
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,969
Everybody knows the best whores
in the country are in Vancouver.

161
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:04,770
- Vancouver ain't the country.
- You know what I'm saying, jackass.

162
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,811
There's no money to stay in a hotel, Turtle.

163
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:07,936
What?

164
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:10,242
I can't be bringing girls back
to my mom's house.

165
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,841
- The walls are paper thin.
- You ain't making them scream anyway.

166
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,182
What if I pay my own way?

167
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,947
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You gonna sell a kidney?

168
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:22,118
The going-away party.
We can charge $10 a head to get in.

169
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:25,129
- You wanna promote the going-away party?
- Interesting.

170
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:28,166
Come on, Vince, I'll make us a boatload
of money, all right?

171
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:29,996
You get 10% of the door...

172
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:33,161
and a prime table surrounded
by all the hotties in L.A.

173
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:36,435
- All you got to do is just smile.
- He doesn't need 10% of the door.

174
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:38,874
Yes, he does,
after you got him the shitty deal.

175
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:42,340
I told you, I didn't make his fucking deal.

176
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,176
Vince, override this guy.

177
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:48,353
E, come on. It's a party.

178
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:51,753
It'll make Turtle feel good about himself
if he earns a little cash.

179
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,791
Yes. It'll boost my self-esteem.

180
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:55,588
What do you say?

181
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:57,123
Yeah, whatever.

182
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:58,719
Knock it out, Turtle.

183
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,765
What's the movement
on Scarlett Johansson?

184
00:09:02,968 --> 00:09:05,061
You know what, Vince? I'm not your pimp.

185
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,935
If you want Scarlett Johansson's number,
get it yourself.

186
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,099
What did I say?

187
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:13,974
Yo, mofos, check this out.

188
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:15,302
Ready?

189
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:21,610
Tobey Maguire's house.

190
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:24,221
Bang, Spidey!

191
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,721
What's better, Taggert or Taggert?

192
00:09:32,164 --> 00:09:33,153
What?

193
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,394
Taggert or Taggert?

194
00:09:36,168 --> 00:09:38,762
- The first one.
- Damn. Really?

195
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,701
Yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

196
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:41,898
No problem.

197
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:46,444
<i>Viking Quest, right?</i>

198
00:09:46,745 --> 00:09:48,076
Yeah, that's me.

199
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,408
I knew it.

200
00:09:50,749 --> 00:09:53,616
Do you think I can get a signed picture
for my wall?

201
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,945
- Yes.
- For an extra 1,000 invites.

202
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,251
Why not? For Torvald, anything.

203
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:09,596
Five minutes, that's all.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to her.

204
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,693
Then you can cross her off the list.

205
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,999
It never takes just five minutes with this girl.

206
00:10:14,106 --> 00:10:15,300
Five minutes.

207
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,937
- Girls, what's happening?
- How you ladies doing?

208
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,410
Big party Saturday night.

209
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,880
Vince Chase is going out of town.
You gotta be there.

210
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,007
You might have heard.

211
00:10:25,117 --> 00:10:26,345
Be there or be square.

212
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:27,419
How you ladies doing?

213
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,509
Off the hook.

214
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,987
$10, but if you give me your phone number,
it's $5.

215
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,581
It's gonna be a great party.
You don't wanna miss that.

216
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,224
Honey, how are ya?

217
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:38,630
- They call this work?
- God bless America!

218
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:53,109
I've never been with anyone
that can fuck this long.

219
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,804
I've been training for this movie.

220
00:10:54,914 --> 00:10:57,712
It's gonna be a great fucking movie.

221
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,521
I've been sitting here for 45 minutes
while he's getting laid.

222
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,921
Then you're an idiot. You should leave.

223
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,119
- It's not Scarlett Johansson?
- No.

224
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,428
God, he's so disrespectful.

225
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,589
No. He's sick. He's codependent.

226
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,963
Why do you think
he never got his driver's license?

227
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:18,662
Fuck it. I'm leaving. Bullshit.

228
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,938
Yeah. Okay. Hold on.

229
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,466
Shauna, it's Richard again.

230
00:11:22,575 --> 00:11:23,633
God!

231
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,475
Richard, you are
a spindly, weaselly, prick queen...

232
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,604
I swear, if you print that about Gary Busey...

233
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:31,547
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to ruin your fucking life.

234
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,084
- I'll see you back at the office, Christy.
- All right.

235
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,051
And stay on top of that douche bag.

236
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,213
Yeah.

237
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,592
Asshole.

238
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:44,456
What the fuck is this now?

239
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:47,721
God!

240
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,157
Shauna, I agree.

241
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:51,395
Bon voyage?

242
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,336
It sounds like you're shipping
a gay French couple off to sea.

243
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,771
I didn't know anything about it.

244
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:56,841
This is so low rent.

245
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,467
You could've used bonded paper
and an approved photo.

246
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:01,512
<i>It looks like an audition for American Idol.</i>

247
00:12:01,614 --> 00:12:05,141
<i>Eric, you should know better.
Use your fucking directional!</i>

248
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,115
<i>God damn it! These people driving here.</i>

249
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,052
<i>Vincent doesn't need his name
associated with nightclub promoting.</i>

250
00:12:10,155 --> 00:12:12,316
God forbid, there's a Happy Land fire
in there...

251
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:13,982
like that Great White concert
in Rhode Island...

252
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:16,288
we're fucked. Get your house in order, Eric.

253
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:18,655
Jesus.

254
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,457
Who says it's my house?

255
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,044
I just had Shauna rip me a new asshole.

256
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:38,741
You don't have to take shit from her.
She's a publicist.

257
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:43,584
Jerk-off, you plaster cheap crappy fliers
with Vince's picture all over town.

258
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,020
That wasn't cheap.

259
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:47,718
I paid half price, and it was still expensive.

260
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,350
So you go behind my fucking back?

261
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:51,156
I didn't go behind your back.

262
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:53,561
You wanted nothing to do with this.
I did it myself.

263
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:56,364
You were too busy getting Vince
to do a movie...

264
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:57,730
that's gonna leave us homeless.

265
00:12:57,836 --> 00:12:59,531
This movie's gonna make Vince's career.

266
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,868
It better. Or else we're all fucked.

267
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,204
Maybe we're fucked anyway.

268
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:08,878
Come on, Turtle. Let's go get this thing.

269
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:11,241
Knock them dead there, Drama.
Good luck, buddy.

270
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,681
Thanks. Come on.

271
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,817
Look at you.

272
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,253
How you doing, baby?
I'm gonna nail this thing.

273
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,154
- Go get them, Johnny.
- All right.

274
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,391
What the fuck, E, you left me!

275
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,296
Luckily, look who I bumped into
driving down Wilshire.

276
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,991
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Janeen.

277
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:34,334
Janeen was sweet enough to give me a ride
after you ditched me.

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,135
Why did you do that to Vince, Eric?

279
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,068
Yeah, E, why?

280
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:41,203
Why?

281
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,706
Long story.

282
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,685
- You want a drink, babe?
- You got any juice boxes?

283
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,252
You should've seen him coming down
Wilshire Blvd. All alone.

284
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,986
He looked so cute.

285
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,988
Are you okay?

286
00:13:57,496 --> 00:14:00,727
I'm a little shaken up. But I think I'll be okay.

287
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,560
I can't believe you're leaving.

288
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,329
I'm just going for a couple months.

289
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,859
Yeah?

290
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,815
Vince, we gotta be at Ari's in 20 minutes.

291
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:19,506
Can you cover for me?

292
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,653
- We're gonna have a Jacuz.
- We gotta go over these deal points.

293
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,289
Could you get me some more money
on that, please?

294
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:28,155
- What if they want you to sign something?
- Come on, E.

295
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,423
Who forges my signature better than you?
Shall we?

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,626
Be nice to Vince.

297
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,167
Yeah. Thanks.

298
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,964
Taggert! We meet again.

299
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:45,744
For you, maybe.
I always relish our encounters.

300
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:50,340
No, Taggert.
I'm afraid it's your time that's up!

301
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,088
I just crushed that.

302
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,199
Pizza boy's here.

303
00:15:13,172 --> 00:15:14,139
Really?

304
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:16,165
Really.

305
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:25,505
What's wrong with her?

306
00:15:25,617 --> 00:15:28,643
Ask my permission before you bang
one of my assistants.

307
00:15:29,021 --> 00:15:30,886
- How'd you know that?
- 'Cause I know all.

308
00:15:30,989 --> 00:15:33,355
I could've told you this would end badly.

309
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,493
I gotta fire her so you don't feel weird.

310
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:36,583
Don't fire her.

311
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,129
I'll just sexually harass her until she quits.

312
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,062
- Where's Vinny?
- He sent me.

313
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:44,798
As long as I'm here, I want to talk.

314
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:46,171
Yeah?

315
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,602
About management.

316
00:15:50,676 --> 00:15:53,270
There you go, baby. All right!

317
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,539
Come here. Let's hug it out, you little bitch!
I love it.

318
00:15:56,648 --> 00:15:59,446
Step aside and let a professional take over.
That's fantastic.

319
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,576
Let's call Jimmy Miller. Let's get leverage.

320
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:03,416
360, Handprint. Any one of these.

321
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:05,217
Ari, I'm talking about me.

322
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,992
I thought you already were his manager.
Because, believe me...

323
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:13,455
I would not put up with this much shit
from anyone who wasn't.

324
00:16:13,565 --> 00:16:16,056
I know I am. But I want to do it for real.

325
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:18,702
I wanna have the conversation. Lock it in.

326
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,203
You come to me for advice?

327
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:23,001
I'm gonna fucking cry.
All right, here's what you do.

328
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,542
You deal with talent
the same way you deal with women.

329
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,134
You have to make them believe...

330
00:16:27,246 --> 00:16:28,873
they need you more than you need them.

331
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:29,948
He doesn't need me much.

332
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:31,777
Of course not. You're fucking worthless.

333
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,875
I could get a million morons to do the job.

334
00:16:33,986 --> 00:16:35,817
- That's not the point.
- What is the point?

335
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,219
The point is that he is an insecure fuck...

336
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:41,588
like all beautiful but handed-everything-
on-a-silver platter people.

337
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,752
He doesn't trust anyone
in this world but you.

338
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:46,330
You've been born into royalty, baby.
You know that.

339
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:49,195
Now you just gotta be thankful
and wear the crown.

340
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,600
As much as I appreciate it,
I didn't come here to ask for your advice.

341
00:16:52,704 --> 00:16:54,672
I came to ask for your support.

342
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,440
- Do I have a choice? No, I don't.
- No.

343
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,508
You got 1,000%.

344
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,977
Here's a little indie script, $60,000.
Big payday.

345
00:17:06,118 --> 00:17:07,210
- Thanks.
- This is great.

346
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,310
What's next?
You get a uniform and a mustache?

347
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:10,615
I don't have health insurance.

348
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:13,623
- But I bet you had it over at Quiznos.
- Sbarros.

349
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:16,193
- And I had a business card.
- There you go.

350
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:19,129
What am I supposed to say to Emily
when I walk out?

351
00:17:19,231 --> 00:17:21,165
Pretend you're on the phone.
You're focused.

352
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,824
You can't talk to her.

353
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,560
Let's try to get that immediately if we can.

354
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,899
See you later.

355
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,904
Johnny Chase?

356
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:34,807
Represent, bro.

357
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,077
- Sheila, how are ya?
- Hi, good. How are you?

358
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:43,749
- Hello.
- There he is.

359
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,016
- Thanks for having me.
- How ya doing?

360
00:17:46,892 --> 00:17:50,157
- You look familiar.
- You auditioned for me a couple years ago.

361
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:52,427
How did that go?

362
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:55,096
- You know.
- You can't work them all.

363
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,663
All right. Any notes, any thoughts,
anything I should know?

364
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,761
No, just give it a shot. We'll go from there.

365
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,840
I could do this a million different ways.

366
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:06,274
Why don't you try it just one way?
Make a choice and give it a shot.

367
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:07,572
Stick to it.

368
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:17,552
Hooga! One time, baby. Come on.

369
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:26,087
Taggert, we meet again.

370
00:18:26,531 --> 00:18:28,499
And that's one time too many.

371
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:30,064
For you, maybe.

372
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,837
I always relish these moments.

373
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,600
Your time is up, Conlon.

374
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:37,202
No, Taggert.

375
00:18:39,645 --> 00:18:41,875
I'm afraid it's your time that's up.

376
00:18:43,782 --> 00:18:45,215
Come on, man.

377
00:18:45,784 --> 00:18:48,776
A little respect. Yo, back there.

378
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,013
I'm acting here. A little respect?

379
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:52,818
I mean, please.

380
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,180
Important e-mail.

381
00:18:54,292 --> 00:18:56,988
I've been working on this thing all day.
This is important.

382
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,357
John, don't let it throw you.

383
00:18:58,463 --> 00:19:00,522
- Just ignore him.
- Focus.

384
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:03,123
Fuck that, man! Tell this guy to focus.

385
00:19:03,235 --> 00:19:05,135
Johnny, thank you for coming in.

386
00:19:05,237 --> 00:19:06,727
- Appreciate it.
- Bye.

387
00:19:06,972 --> 00:19:09,372
- Great job.
- Thank you.

388
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,966
You know what? Fuck you!

389
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:17,810
Shit.

390
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,047
I don't know. I thought he was great.

391
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:23,814
Fuck TV!
Let's go to New York and make a movie!

392
00:19:23,922 --> 00:19:27,915
- There you go, baby.
- Can I stay with your mother?

393
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:29,919
I remember.

394
00:19:30,862 --> 00:19:32,727
Of course you can bring her.

395
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,224
Yeah?

396
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,870
Hopefully I'll see you in the Hamptons.

397
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,631
Labor Day. I can't wait. Bye.

398
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:48,809
I think that's the last one.

399
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,273
- So, what are you doing for dinner tonight?
- What?

400
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,419
We should go to dinner before the party.

401
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,282
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

402
00:19:56,388 --> 00:19:58,652
Some stuff? What do you mean?
Sounds weird.

403
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,423
It's nothing weird.

404
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,287
E, you're not coming out of the closet,
are you?

405
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:07,322
'Cause you know I like long legs.

406
00:20:07,966 --> 00:20:09,991
I want to talk to you
about being your manager.

407
00:20:10,102 --> 00:20:11,535
As opposed to what?

408
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,699
As opposed to nothing,
which is what I am now.

409
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,035
Kristen's been fucking with your head again.

410
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:23,011
- No, she has not.
- Come on, E.

411
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:26,241
Admit it. You guys have a very
dysfunctional relationship.

412
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:29,047
Every time you come from her,
you sound like her.

413
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:32,089
- Maybe she should be my manager.
- All right, fuck dinner.

414
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,214
Relax, E.

415
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:37,019
I wanted to go to dinner
and talk about this stuff there.

416
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:38,653
You're making me talk about it here.

417
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:40,823
And it's just not going right. Fuck dinner.

418
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:44,299
Nothing's been said. Nobody said anything.

419
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:45,960
Nothing's been talked about.

420
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,801
You want to take me to dinner?
You wanna talk business?

421
00:20:48,907 --> 00:20:51,637
You want to woo me? Wine and dine me.

422
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:52,934
All right.

423
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:56,211
Let me pack up some things. We'll talk.

424
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,816
- Who's buying?
- I'm buying.

425
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,749
With my credit card that I pay the bill on.

426
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,555
I'm doing this real. This is no bullshit.

427
00:21:10,662 --> 00:21:12,994
Great. Now I know what I'm gonna order.

428
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,100
Lanie!

429
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,294
- Did I hear you're going out of town?
- I'm leaving tonight.

430
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,338
I can't believe
you didn't say goodbye to me.

431
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:23,634
Why do you think I'm here?
I'm saying goodbye now.

432
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,039
Listen.

433
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:27,236
You remember that
really good bottle of wine...

434
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:28,437
that I got here with Ridley?

435
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:30,981
- Yeah, '82 Margaux.
- Yeah, that's the one.

436
00:21:31,216 --> 00:21:33,116
We're gonna have two of those.

437
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:35,744
You must be important.

438
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,280
We'll see.

439
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:41,459
Before l...

440
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,358
Can we hold off a couple seconds
before we get into business?

441
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,063
My boys just showed.

442
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,868
- What up, player?
- Yo!

443
00:21:54,706 --> 00:21:55,798
I'm hungry.

444
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:59,034
You want this real.
This is how I did it with Ari.

445
00:21:59,144 --> 00:22:02,079
- What are you gonna do for us?
- Yeah?

446
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,704
I've been doing this job for a year.

447
00:22:03,815 --> 00:22:07,512
- I don't need to put up with this bullshit.
- E, you're really wooing me.

448
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,986
- E never was a real people person.
- That's gonna have to change...

449
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:13,216
if you want to be involved
in talent management.

450
00:22:13,325 --> 00:22:15,486
Now, I'm pissed. What's your answer?

451
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,090
What's your sales pitch?

452
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,731
All right, Vince.

453
00:22:25,837 --> 00:22:27,532
I picked your last movie.

454
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:30,398
I put you in this new movie. I know you.

455
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,169
I know your strengths.
I know your weaknesses.

456
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,876
- Yeah, you do have a few.
- Vince ain't got no weaknesses.

457
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:38,609
That's a double negative.

458
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,480
You just said he's got weaknesses.

459
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,076
I'm starting to see how this business works.

460
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:46,753
I feel like I'm starting
to learn how to work it.

461
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,085
How many times
have we heard that one, Vince?

462
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,183
Shut the fuck up, Turtle.

463
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:53,423
Vince, take your time.
Don't rush into anything.

464
00:22:53,965 --> 00:22:56,627
You guys are right.
I gotta think about things.

465
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:59,468
- I like the way things are.
- I don't.

466
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,167
E, you know I don't like change.

467
00:23:03,275 --> 00:23:04,640
I'm not going to New York.

468
00:23:04,743 --> 00:23:06,074
- Really?
- Really.

469
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,973
I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.

470
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:14,051
Fuck you, all right?
You asked me to move out here.

471
00:23:14,152 --> 00:23:16,518
Don't forget that. Here you go, asshole.

472
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,689
You're still going
to the going-away party, right?

473
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:21,122
Shut up, Turtle.

474
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:30,659
I can't believe he's not coming.
How can he not come?

475
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,737
I knew this Kristen thing
was gonna backfire.

476
00:23:32,837 --> 00:23:35,169
We should've made Emily work.
She was a career girl.

477
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:36,240
No.

478
00:23:36,841 --> 00:23:40,333
He said Kristen had nothing to do with it.
It was his own stupid decision.

479
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,339
You made the stupid decision, bro.

480
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:46,348
- What?
- Yeah. You ain't that easy.

481
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:51,382
You think you're going to find someone
you like that could tolerate you 24l7?

482
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,683
I love you, bro. But I ain't doing it.

483
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:54,816
I could do it.

484
00:23:54,926 --> 00:23:56,621
Yes. That's a good option.

485
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:09,034
Let's go party.

486
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,631
Fuck that! I'm not going in there.

487
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,573
- Come on. One beer.
- No. Come on.

488
00:24:13,678 --> 00:24:16,044
Let's get blasted on the plane.
Just the three of us.

489
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,844
Fine by me. But I just gotta go in there first
and handle a little business.

490
00:24:23,989 --> 00:24:27,015
- Is that Vincent Chase in there?
- No. Vince is inside.

491
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:28,989
He just called me. I gotta go see him now.

492
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,425
Come in, though.

493
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:34,959
Yo, let me use your phone.

494
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:48,868
Hello?

495
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:51,779
This is awkward.

496
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:54,249
I forgot my wallet.

497
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:56,577
Come on, Vince. Fuck you.

498
00:24:56,688 --> 00:24:59,213
Seriously, it's somewhere
on the coffee table.

499
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,723
<i>Come on. What do you say?</i>

500
00:25:00,825 --> 00:25:03,259
<i>I'd get it myself,
but I gotta go all the way there...</i>

501
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:05,295
and all the way back. It just seems stupid.

502
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:07,092
What do you say? Come on.

503
00:25:08,566 --> 00:25:10,466
Okay. I'll be there.

504
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:11,657
Thanks.

505
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,305
You're an asshole.

506
00:25:18,076 --> 00:25:20,943
Excuse me, guys. Sorry. Have a good night.

507
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,747
You two, go get some drinks in there.
It's crazy.

508
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:30,554
- Cha-ching!
- Yeah.

509
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:34,019
My mother would rather be dead
than have you stay with us.

510
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:35,785
Sweet.

511
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:31,406
Only a real asshole would spend $30,000
on a flight...

512
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:33,507
when the whole job's
only paying him $60,000.

513
00:26:33,618 --> 00:26:34,949
It's worth it.

514
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,180
How else are we gonna bring
the Sherpa weed and the dog?

515
00:26:39,157 --> 00:26:40,818
You're still an asshole.

516
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,554
- Here's your wallet.
- Thanks.

517
00:27:42,587 --> 00:27:46,819
You're telling me
you're willing to fuck up our friendship...

518
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:50,394
'cause if this doesn't work out,
there's no turning back.

519
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:52,326
My best friend, I can't fire.

520
00:27:52,864 --> 00:27:55,697
But my manager, he's replaceable.

521
00:27:55,967 --> 00:27:58,128
That's a chance I'm willing to take.

522
00:28:01,706 --> 00:28:04,573
Yeah, at 5% of me, I'd take that chance, too.

523
00:28:04,676 --> 00:28:05,700
10%.

524
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:07,769
Plus health insurance.

525
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,669
Hello?

526
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,712
Who is that? Kristen? Let me talk to her.

527
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,249
I wanna settle this whole thing.

528
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:14,443
Hold on a second.

529
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:17,385
Thanks for calling me back,
I really appreciate it.

530
00:28:18,923 --> 00:28:19,912
Hello?

531
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:23,118
Hi, Vince. It's Scarlett. Is this a bad time?

532
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:27,461
Scarlett! How are you?

533
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,161
Where are you?

534
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,198
I'm in New York, I just got in.

535
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:36,399
Really? I'm on my way
to New York right now.

536
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,308
You wanna grab a late dinner?

537
00:28:42,213 --> 00:28:43,942
Let's make it an early breakfast.

538
00:28:44,048 --> 00:28:46,209
I tell you what. I'll call you when I land.

539
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:48,012
Okay. Cool.

540
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,915
- Talk to you later.
- See you later.

541
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,481
- Nice.
- That's what I do.

542
00:28:55,827 --> 00:28:57,158
Get on the plane.

543
00:28:57,595 --> 00:28:58,755
What about my car?

544
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,661
Your car?
You want me to buy you a new car?

545
00:29:01,899 --> 00:29:04,390
- No, I like my car.
- Get the fuck out of here.

546
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:05,469
Leave it.

547
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,767
I can't have my manager driving around
in a piece of shit like that.

548
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:13,038
You going somewhere?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
