1
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:09,959
- So, how many times you call her?
- Once.

2
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,764
And she didn't call you back? Bitch.

3
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,093
Emily's not a bitch.

4
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,169
I was calling you a bitch,
for thinking about calling her again.

5
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:18,634
That is very bitch-like.

6
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:21,874
You call a girl once, she don't call you back,
the relationship's over.

7
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,268
I was drunk.
I don't even remember what I said.

8
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,843
Maybe she never got the message.

9
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:28,379
- You drunk-dialed her?
- Still, no excuse.

10
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,539
- No more tequila for this guy.
- You're cut off.

11
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:33,880
- What is she so mad about, anyway?
- It's not that she's mad.

12
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:37,888
She feels like I'm putting her in
an uncomfortable situation with me and Ari.

13
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,049
You should've bluffed her, spun it around.

14
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,821
Let her think you're uncomfortable
with the situation.

15
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:46,921
First Kristen, then Emily.
Why do you let these girls get in your head?

16
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:50,832
The guys have a point.
You're getting a little soft in your old age.

17
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:53,496
It's Ari, finally. Ari, where are you?

18
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:56,107
<i>Right where I'm supposed to be.
Where are you?</i>

19
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,775
We're at Coffee Bean, like we said.

20
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:01,044
<i>No, we said Starbucks, Eric.</i>

21
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:04,115
<i>I distinctly remember,
because I fucked a counter girl here.</i>

22
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:07,413
Be careful crossing the street.
He's at Starbucks.

23
00:02:13,158 --> 00:02:15,126
What, did you rob a bank?

24
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:19,095
<i>I earned it. Pacific Blue residuals, baby.
We sold Malaysia.</i>

25
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:22,797
- How much you got there, bro?
- Don't you worry about it.

26
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:24,695
So, what's with the face to face?

27
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:27,397
I just want you guys to know
that all of my attention...

28
00:02:27,506 --> 00:02:29,974
<i>is now focused on Queens Boulevard.</i>

29
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,675
That's nice.

30
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,109
- Isn't that nice?
- Yeah. So, we have a deal or what?

31
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:37,546
- We got a deal pending.
- Pending what?

32
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,050
Pending a meeting with the director.

33
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,353
We gotta get approved by the director now?

34
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,117
No, we don't. It's like a meet and greet.
A blind date. Fifteen minutes.

35
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,853
You have a drink, you like each other,
you make a movie.

36
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,986
- Blind dates are my forte.
- There you go.

37
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:55,897
I'm heading up the coast with the missus.
Call me, tell me if you guys like each other.

38
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,830
- You did good, Ari.
- Thank you.

39
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,996
- Tell him, E.
- You did good, Ari.

40
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:02,403
We just had a moment. Did you feel that?

41
00:03:02,508 --> 00:03:05,534
I think I'm gonna leave Mrs. Ari
and take you for the weekend.

42
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,838
Don't do that.

43
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,577
- So, who's the guy?
- Billy Walsh.

44
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,240
- Yeah?
- You heard of him?

45
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,683
<i>Yeah, the guy won Sundance.
Film called Daze.</i>

46
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:16,785
I read the guy financed his movie...

47
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,754
- by donating blood.
- How was it?

48
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:21,223
I didn't see that shit.
You know I don't like indies.

49
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:24,228
- I'm into the studio system.
- Ari says this guy's hot.

50
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,798
Everybody in town wants to work with him.
We got him.

51
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:28,264
He wants to work with Vince.

52
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,302
- You'll ask him about a part for me, right?
- And nothing else.

53
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:33,462
- Where's the meeting?
- Chateau.

54
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,635
- Arnold, come on, boy.
- You guys want to roll with?

55
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,505
The fuck else we got to do, player?

56
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,717
You guys hang here.
We'll be back in a little while.

57
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,525
Don't talk to us like we're adopted, bro.

58
00:04:12,177 --> 00:04:14,645
Just leave it outside the door, asshole!

59
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:16,476
It's Vincent Chase.

60
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,742
- You Billy?
- No.

61
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,725
You guys see Billy around anywhere?

62
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,694
- You know Billy?
- Yeah, whatever.

63
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:34,992
All right.

64
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:38,934
Sorry, pal.

65
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:45,165
- You sure you're not Billy?
- Do I look like fucking Billy?

66
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,210
I don't think that's Billy.

67
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,293
My man, Vincent Chase.

68
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,998
Wick was right.
You're very fuckable in person.

69
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:17,238
You fucking laughing?
This guy's the best actor of his generation.

70
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,901
No bullshit.
He'll blow all your asses off the screen.

71
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,480
- Thank you.
- You guys are early.

72
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,742
Actually, no. We're right on time.

73
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,478
That might mean something to me
if I knew who you were.

74
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:30,453
- This is my buddy, Eric.
- You can call me E.

75
00:05:31,824 --> 00:05:35,157
Is that your thing, being on time?
I won Sundance at 24.

76
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,956
What do you gotta say
about that kind of arrival?

77
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,826
- Congratulations.
- Cool.

78
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:43,832
I'm gonna get dressed.
You guys grab a cocktail or something.

79
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:47,163
I'll be right out.

80
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:49,874
He's a nice guy.

81
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:54,034
We're not here to make friends.
We're here to make a movie.

82
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,274
You know Howard Hughes
used to stay in this room back in the day.

83
00:05:57,382 --> 00:05:59,475
Now Scorsese's doing the movie.

84
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:02,782
They offered it to Billy first,
but he turned it down.

85
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,981
He ain't gonna soft-soap nobody.

86
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,382
Billy's a genius, brother.
You're lucky to be working with him.

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,228
- You're an asshole!
- Shut up!

88
00:06:12,898 --> 00:06:15,833
- Come on, let's get some coffee.
- Bye, baby.

89
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:21,999
Come on. I'm buying.

90
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,414
You ever jerk off
with a belt around your neck?

91
00:06:34,653 --> 00:06:36,780
No. Should I?

92
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,418
Sounds interesting.

93
00:06:40,893 --> 00:06:44,761
All right, forget that shit.
Check this out. Scandinavian twins.

94
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,798
For $1,500, they'll come over
and fuck us like we're Vince.

95
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,561
I don't pay for pussy.

96
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:52,535
Since when?
It's like 50 rub and tugs with you.

97
00:06:52,638 --> 00:06:55,402
Since I like walking around
with money in my pocket.

98
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:58,670
Come on, Drama,
you got that fat residual check.

99
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,671
They're just your type.

100
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,105
No means no.

101
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:07,641
Let me talk to him.
You're like a fucking bull in a china shop.

102
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,050
Thank you.

103
00:07:09,688 --> 00:07:11,212
All right, one.

104
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,819
My agent.

105
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:16,390
Fucking prick wants me to do
a studio movie.

106
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,655
Yeah, mine, too.

107
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:21,164
I told him to go fuck himself.
I'm not in this for the money, Vince.

108
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>Queens Boulevard
is gonna be my Mean Streets.</i>

109
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,996
- Kind of an ode to the way we grew up.
- You grew up in Queens?

110
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:31,132
Scarsdale, but my dad owned a Key Food
in Kew Gardens.

111
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:35,647
I bet you'd like to see Vince
do a big studio movie, E?

112
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,080
- Actually, no.
- He just wants me to do a good film.

113
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:44,221
Come on. There is no glory
in making a $5 million indie, E.

114
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:46,453
There is if it's a good one.

115
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,626
Ari said you had thoughts on the script,
things you might want to change.

116
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,594
- It's done.
- What did you do?

117
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,830
I made Vincent's character a man.

118
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:59,404
See, he was a pussy.
That sensitive shit was putting me to sleep.

119
00:07:59,504 --> 00:08:01,495
The stuff with the girlfriend
was pretty good.

120
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,006
No, it wasn't.

121
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,805
Vince, I want to shoot you long-lensed.

122
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:09,278
Give you size in the frame, power.

123
00:08:09,414 --> 00:08:13,043
<i>Like Redford in Three Days of the Condor.
McQueen in Bullitt.</i>

124
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,785
<i>You like The Pope of Greenwich Village?</i>

125
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,548
It's one of my favorite films.

126
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:19,350
You should do a remake of that, Vince.

127
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,655
No. No one should ever remake that movie.
It was perfect.

128
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,423
<i>You'd let them redo the Mona Lisa, E?</i>

129
00:08:26,398 --> 00:08:27,626
Anyway...

130
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,097
read it. Tell me what you think.

131
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:34,529
- All right.
- Call my cell. I'll be waiting.

132
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,900
- Great.
- Don't let the suit influence you.

133
00:08:38,043 --> 00:08:39,977
Hey, man, I'm not a suit.

134
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:43,345
Yeah, man, you are.
You just don't know it yet.

135
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:46,610
- Toodle-loo.
- See you later.

136
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,355
I'm Johnny, Vince's brother.

137
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:53,685
I really digged your movie, man.

138
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,726
<i>- It was great.
- Gracie.</i>

139
00:08:58,597 --> 00:08:59,928
Unbelievable.

140
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:02,460
- You must've found a glitch.
- So what?

141
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,296
So you're a little glitch bitch.

142
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:06,769
Blame the game makers.
Don't blame the player, hater.

143
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:07,861
Give me that control.

144
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,531
- Get off! Why are...
- This one sucks.

145
00:09:09,641 --> 00:09:11,302
Who dates Scarlett Johansson?

146
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:14,769
Ryan Gosling? Actually, I don't know.

147
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,511
I love her.

148
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,310
Vince, we got a big problem here.

149
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:22,148
E., we have no problems. Life is good.

150
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,150
Do you know who dates
Scarlett Johansson?

151
00:09:24,256 --> 00:09:26,087
- No.
- I think I'm in love with her.

152
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,158
Did you read this?

153
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:29,250
You know I like to get
your impressions first.

154
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:32,091
It's a disaster.
This guy Walsh is out of his fucking mind.

155
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,165
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

156
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:35,656
Don't get so emotional just 'cause
you got a personal problem with him.

157
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:36,859
What?

158
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:39,868
He wasn't so nice to E.

159
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,137
- That's not it.
- This guy gets more opinionated every day.

160
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:46,540
Don't fuck this up, E.
I really want to do this.

161
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,738
The guy said the suit would be judgmental.

162
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,782
He's got a guy blowing you on Page 26!

163
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:53,712
Come on.

164
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:55,547
Seriously?

165
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:57,648
I better read it.

166
00:09:57,756 --> 00:10:00,725
- I better read that shit, too.
- Who's blowing him?

167
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,787
I hope it's not the part of the bookie,
'cause I'm playing that.

168
00:10:04,963 --> 00:10:06,931
That would be really awkward.

169
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,868
Look, Vince,
there's no shame in playing gay.

170
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:14,234
<i>Look at Tom Hanks, Philadelphia.
The guy won an Oscar.</i>

171
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,471
I'd take it in the ass on camera for an Oscar.

172
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:21,239
<i>You'd take it in the ass
for a guest spot on The Hughleys.</i>

173
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:22,836
That's not even on the air anymore.

174
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:25,542
I don't know about you,
but I don't want to see Vince...

175
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,847
running around Queens
with a silk shirt knotted at the bellybutton.

176
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,548
- You're really homophobic.
- No, I'm not.

177
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,488
If you were gay, okay, I'd accept that.
But you're not.

178
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,527
So why are you gonna pretend you are?

179
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:39,961
'Cause the guy's an actor, you fucking idiot.
That's what he does.

180
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,795
No, that's what you do,
you ass-fucked loser.

181
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,963
Keep it up, Turtle.

182
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,163
It's not about an Oscar
or the neighborhood.

183
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,001
If it's good, I'll do it.

184
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,507
I'm just not sure I understand
why it's in there.

185
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,205
It's in there 'cause Walsh is psychotic.
He's got to change the script back.

186
00:10:55,313 --> 00:10:57,611
- So call him, E.
- I'm calling him.

187
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:02,653
Billy, it's E.

188
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,380
Yeah, Vince's guy.

189
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:09,221
Listen, we want to talk to you
about the script.

190
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:12,554
Hold on a second.

191
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,764
He's at Crazy Girls.
He wants us to come over right now.

192
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,233
- Sweet.
- Crazy Girls at noon?

193
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:20,133
Cancel that order, honey.

194
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:22,399
Crazy Girls has got a great buffet.

195
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,558
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:46,721
They got downgraded to a "B."

197
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,892
If these warm plates aren't heated up
to the right temperature...

198
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,060
they become hotbeds of bacteria.

199
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:57,169
Isn't that that girl from Cheetahs in Vegas?

200
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,800
Yeah, the one you cock blocked me for.

201
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:02,011
Please, she was so into me.

202
00:12:09,454 --> 00:12:10,978
Don't cock block.

203
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,848
- I know you guys. How you been?
- I'm good.

204
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,123
This perv likes to beat off
with a belt around his neck.

205
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,164
This guy pays for pussy.

206
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,025
I see you guys haven't changed.

207
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:26,103
So, who wants a lap dance?

208
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,570
Sorry, baby. The money stays here.

209
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:42,620
What's the problem, E? You want a blonde?

210
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,712
I just wanted to talk about the script.

211
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:47,690
So talk about it.
You thought it was genius, right?

212
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,316
Not really, no.

213
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,792
No? What the fuck do you know?

214
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:55,257
Vince, I thought I told you
not to let the suit influence you.

215
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,198
Stop calling me a suit, all right?

216
00:12:57,302 --> 00:13:00,066
I just liked the script better
the way it was, that's all.

217
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:01,570
What did you think, Vince?

218
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:05,006
I thought it was interesting.
I just didn't totally get it.

219
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,874
That's cool.
I was trying to be abstract, like Kurosawa.

220
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:11,676
<i>- You ever seen a Kurosawa film?
- Yeah, I saw Seven Samurai.</i>

221
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,513
I seen them all, Vince.
I'll send you a couple.

222
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:15,586
Cool.

223
00:13:15,687 --> 00:13:18,622
You think the scene
where you're getting a blowjob from a guy...

224
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,554
makes you look like a fag, right?

225
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,762
<i>You ever see Midnight Cowboy?
Does Voight look like a fag in that?</i>

226
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:28,025
In that hat and those boots, he does.

227
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,901
My point is, I wanna make you look manly.

228
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,664
- Okay.
- But you gotta trust me.

229
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,777
Kristen.

230
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:42,006
Really?

231
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,742
Excuse me for a second. Sorry.

232
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:46,615
Ex-Mrs. Suit?

233
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:49,620
You could say that.

234
00:13:49,988 --> 00:13:51,922
- Hello?
- So who's Emily?

235
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,924
What are you talking about?
How do you know Emily?

236
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:59,292
I got home and checked my messages
and heard you calling Emily.

237
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:01,024
<i>Can you turn the music down?</i>

238
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,795
I was drunk last night.
I must've dialed your number by accident.

239
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:08,464
You sure it wasn't your subconscious way
of trying to reach out to me?

240
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,637
You analyzing me right now?

241
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:14,643
I got the message and I tried not to call,
but I miss you.

242
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,406
Seriously?

243
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,873
Can we go out to dinner sometime this week
and talk about it?

244
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,009
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

245
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,952
I need $100.
This girl's gonna jerk me in the back.

246
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,022
No.

247
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:27,614
Drama won't lend me money
if it's for sexual acts.

248
00:14:27,726 --> 00:14:29,455
Not now, Turtle. I'm on the phone.

249
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:31,825
You got glitter all over your face.

250
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,531
<i>- Can I call you tonight?
- All right.</i>

251
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:37,659
Bye.

252
00:14:43,908 --> 00:14:45,705
What do you mean,
you committed to the guy?

253
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:48,210
I dig his vibe.
You don't have to get mad at me.

254
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:50,577
He is pretty cool.
He was throwing strippers $20s.

255
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,810
He's a pretentious prick.
You don't wanna make this movie with him.

256
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:56,409
You don't know artists.
You haven't hung out with many.

257
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,388
- Yeah, we're very sensitive.
- I know people, all right?

258
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,482
This guy is an egomaniac
and he's an asshole.

259
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:03,925
Vince, I'll respect
whatever decision you make...

260
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,520
but I'm still going for
that part of the bookie.

261
00:15:06,631 --> 00:15:08,929
I thought I was making the decisions
around here.

262
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,298
Not ultimately. Enough of this.

263
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:15,636
Why don't you tell these guys
how you drunk-dialed Kristen, not Emily?

264
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,503
- You called Kristen?
- You idiot.

265
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,305
What's wrong with you?
Don't ever drunk-dial.

266
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:23,643
E., marry this girl or kill her.
We can't take this anymore.

267
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:29,948
- So, did you call the babysitter?
- I thought you did.

268
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:34,420
No, you were supposed to.
You're the one who likes to talk to her.

269
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:37,552
You think I have a thing for Olga?
This weekend is all us.

270
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:39,459
I'm good to go, baby.

271
00:15:40,465 --> 00:15:43,263
Don't even think about answering that.

272
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:48,335
- Don't even...
- Just quick.

273
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,665
- Hello?
- We got a big problem.

274
00:15:50,809 --> 00:15:52,333
Hold on a second.

275
00:15:53,178 --> 00:15:54,304
Vince has got a problem.

276
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,746
Baby, I took it an hour ago, okay?
I got 10 more minutes before it kicks in.

277
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,010
Just give me a second, honey. Baby.

278
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,547
Vince hated Walsh?

279
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,284
No, I hated him.
Vince doesn't know I'm doing this.

280
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:11,059
Behind the back. Slick, I'm aroused.
Go, baby, go.

281
00:16:11,196 --> 00:16:13,960
<i>- Have you met this guy?
- Yeah, he's a pompous dickhead.</i>

282
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:15,396
Why didn't you say something?

283
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,333
You wanted me to deliver the movie.
That's what I did.

284
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:20,297
You got to get Walsh off.

285
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,366
So now you need my help?
So now you come to the master.

286
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,967
No, Vince needs you.
This guy's gonna ruin the film.

287
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,876
This meeting was not set up
so that Walsh could approve Vince.

288
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,643
<i>It was set up so Vince could approve Walsh,
all right?</i>

289
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:34,878
He picks up the phone, the guy's done.

290
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:37,784
He won't do it, he likes him.
He digs his vibe.

291
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,048
<i>- Yeah? Has he seen his movie?
- No.</i>

292
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:42,285
<i>- Have you seen his movie?
- No.</i>

293
00:16:42,527 --> 00:16:45,519
Do your fucking homework.
You've got a screening room. Use it.

294
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,359
<i>- Come on.
- What, have you seen it?</i>

295
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,925
No, I haven't. You think I'll stand in line
in the snow in Utah wearing a beanie?

296
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,128
<i>Maybe Vince will hate the movie, though.</i>

297
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,035
I gotta go.

298
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:03,343
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to the pool.

299
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:06,906
- Come on.
- You said no business calls. We had a deal.

300
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:09,343
I'm ready to go here, all right?

301
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:10,887
It's like R. Kelly at recess.

302
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:14,186
Honey, what are you doing?
Are you kidding me? Baby!

303
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,295
Hello?

304
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:21,797
<i>The Advocate just called to confirm a rumor
that in Vince's next movie...</i>

305
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,027
he's gonna be jerking off some guy
in the subway.

306
00:17:24,135 --> 00:17:27,662
No, Shauna, the guy is touching him.
And don't worry, he's not doing it.

307
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:31,105
Vince is on his way to becoming
a major sex symbol. Don't fuck this up.

308
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:33,871
<i>- Get him on screen with someone with tits.
- Man!</i>

309
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:39,142
<i>When I was on Kimmel,
we said the name of the place...</i>

310
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,582
the guy gave us the whole system
for nothing.

311
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,553
<i>What do you mean, you were on Kimmel?
Is that "X"?</i>

312
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,621
- No, it's a TV show.
- Do you have any "X"?

313
00:17:49,327 --> 00:17:52,922
No, I don't have any "X."
Why don't you girls have a seat?

314
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:56,829
<i>Even if this movie
is better than The Godfather...</i>

315
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:59,961
you guys both tell Vince you hated it.
What is this?

316
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:03,106
That's Sierra and this is Portia.

317
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,811
We pulled them out of Crazy Girls, bro.
For free. How sweet is that?

318
00:18:07,912 --> 00:18:09,140
Sweet.

319
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:12,747
Full house.

320
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:17,579
- Nice.
- I bet this movie's gonna kick ass.

321
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,925
- Positivity.
- All right, Turtle, fire it up.

322
00:19:10,575 --> 00:19:12,440
Holy shit, that sucked!

323
00:19:12,977 --> 00:19:16,310
- Fuck black and white.
- Reminds me of Godard.

324
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:19,711
So, what did you think?

325
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,710
What'd you think?

326
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:25,846
I knew you were gonna hate it.
You came into this with no other possibility.

327
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,948
I didn't hate it.

328
00:19:28,326 --> 00:19:29,759
You didn't hate it?

329
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,524
You know, truthfully,
I think this guy's a complete jerk-off.

330
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,724
- It was amazing, right?
- He's a fucking genius.

331
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:39,166
Vince, you do this movie,
they're gonna burn down Queens Boulevard.

332
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,637
Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.
Johnny, run down the list again.

333
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:47,076
<i>Will Smith, Six Degrees of Separation.
Robin Williams, Birdcage.</i>

334
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:52,476
<i>Lucky Leo's gone gay two times:
Basketball Diaries and Eclipse.</i>

335
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:56,478
<i>So has Pacino in Cruising
and Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

336
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,922
<i>- Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man.
- Rain Man was gay?</i>

337
00:20:00,124 --> 00:20:01,785
He wasn't gay, just retarded.

338
00:20:01,893 --> 00:20:05,590
Either way, you play gay or retarded,
you win an Oscar.

339
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:08,698
Guys, give me a second.
I need some time to think.

340
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,327
What do you girls say
we take this party up to the hot tub?

341
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:15,195
I'm really not in the mood for that tonight.

342
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,508
- What's the matter? You don't feel good?
- I'm a little depressed.

343
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,545
I'm getting evicted.
I'm late on my rent again.

344
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,949
- How much is rent?
- $1,200.

345
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:33,219
I got your rent money right here.
Let's go swimming.

346
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:39,490
I thought you don't pay for sex.

347
00:20:39,597 --> 00:20:42,088
I'm not paying for sex.
I'm paying her rent, jerk-off.

348
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,497
Yeah, right.

349
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:45,758
So?

350
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,304
I feel like he's gonna make a great movie.

351
00:20:48,406 --> 00:20:50,874
So the only problem you have
is that one scene?

352
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:52,636
Yeah, one fucking scene.

353
00:20:56,414 --> 00:21:00,043
- I can't believe I fell off the wagon.
- Come on, no regrets.

354
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:04,855
- Was she any good, at least?
- She was great. She's coming back tonight.

355
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,684
I'm gonna have to borrow some money
from Vince.

356
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,424
We're willing to respect
your vision of the movie.

357
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,987
But we want final cut on the scene.
It makes no sense to either of us.

358
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:17,932
But you shoot it,
and maybe you'll change our mind.

359
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,102
No. Sorry, no deal.

360
00:21:21,205 --> 00:21:24,800
- Then Vince isn't doing it.
- Vincent, I make movies a certain way.

361
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,308
You made one movie.

362
00:21:27,378 --> 00:21:29,710
Look, Vince, you're the star.

363
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,479
Wick will throw me off before he loses you,
so be it.

364
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:38,020
You're willing to throw
this whole movie away over one point?

365
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,555
Yes, suit.

366
00:21:40,024 --> 00:21:42,686
That's how much I care about my vision.

367
00:21:43,828 --> 00:21:46,422
Good luck with it, Vincent. Seriously.

368
00:21:51,035 --> 00:21:52,900
All right, fuck it. I'll do it.

369
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:54,938
- You'll do it?
- I'll do it.

370
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,070
All right, do it. Don't fuck this up.

371
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,279
The guy blowing you...

372
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:09,512
I'm gonna play that part.
That way, you're in really good hands.

373
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,919
Don't worry,
I've got a pretty solid acting background.

374
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:22,260
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- I fucking had you, motherfucker!

375
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,697
Fucker!

376
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,259
- I don't get it.
- It was a joke. He was joking the whole time.

377
00:22:27,371 --> 00:22:30,431
- What, the scene's not in the movie?
- No, it's not in the movie.

378
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,068
- It made no sense in the movie.
- I knew it, God damn it.

379
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,942
Good fucking scene, though.
I'm gonna use it somewhere else.

380
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:39,573
And it wasn't a joke, Vincent. It was a test.

381
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:41,709
I needed to make sure that you trusted me.

382
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,414
The only way this movie's gonna work
is if we trust each other.

383
00:22:45,523 --> 00:22:47,013
Yeah, I agree.

384
00:22:48,092 --> 00:22:49,684
But you know what?

385
00:22:50,428 --> 00:22:52,589
Now there's a bigger problem.

386
00:22:53,097 --> 00:22:55,258
- What's that?
- I can't trust you.

387
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:56,724
Come on.

388
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,462
No, you can give E. A hard time.
That's cool.

389
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,597
You think you're gonna fuck with me,
and I'm gonna sit back and do nothing?

390
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:07,576
You know what? Fuck you, motherfucker.
You're fired.

391
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,278
- I'm a good actor, aren't I?
- Fucking...

392
00:23:15,987 --> 00:23:17,852
You fucking...

393
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:20,688
I'm so confused right now. What are you...

394
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:23,954
- A toast. I'll toast to that.
- Yo, Johnny, Turtle.

395
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,255
We're making a movie.

396
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,661
No, Vince. I'm putting my foot down.

397
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,596
Don't worry, the scene's gone.

398
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,998
- Yeah?
- He's been fucking with us.

399
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,464
Cheers, baby!

400
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:36,062
To Vince not getting a blowjob
from some dude.

401
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:37,539
Thank God.

402
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:44,944
- Billy, I gotta tell you, loved your movie.
- Yeah, you told me that already, man.

403
00:23:45,183 --> 00:23:49,244
- Yeah, but this time I actually saw it.
- Did you actually love it?

404
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,919
Look, man, I just want to play the part
of the bookie.

405
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:55,322
I know I could do a really good job.

406
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:59,529
A lying, conniving, two-faced prick.
You're perfect for it.

407
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,427
- Thanks.
- All right!

408
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:03,227
There it is!

409
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:08,193
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.
Next stop, Queens Boulevard.</i>

410
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:09,534
Cheers!
