1
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,527
Do you guys not see the problem here?

2
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:23,129
Vince said she was staying a couple
of nights, all right? A couple is two.

3
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,764
Except in Utah.

4
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:28,542
Look at him. Stop doing fucking yoga, man.
It's embarrassing.

5
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:31,638
- She thinks she's his trainer.
- So do you.

6
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,617
What? I'm not?

7
00:01:35,085 --> 00:01:37,212
What the fuck did I get certified for then?

8
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,186
Relax, Drama, you're his trainer.

9
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,817
It's all a big joke to E, because he's been
sleeping off campus at Emily's.

10
00:01:42,927 --> 00:01:44,485
What, you got a low-jack on me, Turtle?

11
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,564
You guys are both gonna get girlfriends,
and you're gonna fuck everything up.

12
00:01:47,665 --> 00:01:48,859
Quiet, here they come.

13
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:53,199
How was yoga?

14
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:56,432
- Great. Fiona is a great teacher.
- Thanks, baby.

15
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,373
All right.
You ready for a real workout, Vince?

16
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,038
No weights. I just had a mean stretch.

17
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,978
Vince, you got to hit the weights
if you want to put on size.

18
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:10,144
Bulk is so '90s, Johnny.
It's all about flexibility, don't you think?

19
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,380
No, I don't.

20
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,015
We'll catch you later.
We're gonna go grab breakfast.

21
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,092
Bye, guys.

22
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:19,629
I don't trust that New Age bullshit.

23
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,890
Me, neither,
even if it is attached to an ass like that.

24
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,566
Yo, E. What up, dawg?

25
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:27,536
Not much. How about you?

26
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,299
Never better.

27
00:02:30,908 --> 00:02:32,375
Who's that jerkoff?

28
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,634
No clue.

29
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,381
Yankees playing the Angels Tuesday.

30
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:43,646
I got the company box
if you want to roll with.

31
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:47,383
Got the gals from <i>The L Word</i> coming.
Trust me, they're only acting.

32
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:51,057
Not trying to be an asshole or anything,
but do we know each other?

33
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:55,029
Are you kidding me? Josh Weinstein, Triad.
We met at the fight.

34
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,033
Oh, yeah, okay. All right.

35
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,797
Do me a favor.
Put a towel on or something. Cover up.

36
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,998
Not a locker room guy. No problem.

37
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:06,971
So listen, E,
I didn't want to interrupt Vince's workout...

38
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:08,942
but I got a great piece of material.

39
00:03:09,046 --> 00:03:11,207
Would you do me a favor
and have him take a look?

40
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:14,944
You got to understand, the guy gets
hundreds of scripts a week, you know that.

41
00:03:15,052 --> 00:03:17,850
Yet this is something special. It kicks ass.

42
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:21,549
It's gritty as shit. You'll love it.
I guarantee Vince will flip.

43
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:25,889
Tell Vince it was a great move
passing on <i>Matterhorn,</i> too.

44
00:03:25,996 --> 00:03:28,692
- You think?
- Yeah. Script is a piece of shit.

45
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,734
It's not a movie, it's a theme park ride.
There's no characters.

46
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:34,303
- That's what I said.
- But Ari pushed hard for that one.

47
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:36,737
- Yeah.
- You know he doesn't read, right?

48
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:41,134
Anyway, man, this one is different.
Takes place in your old neighborhood.

49
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:43,242
- Queens, right?
- Yeah.

50
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:50,416
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi, sweetheart.

51
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,490
My God. I'm sorry.
I thought you were someone else.

52
00:03:57,194 --> 00:04:00,391
- Come on, Monica.
- I'm done talking to you, Turtle.

53
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:03,397
You were supposed to hook me up
with some weed two days ago.

54
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,867
The whole town is dry, believe me.
I'm not holding out on you.

55
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,062
What are you looking at?

56
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:12,609
These Uggs, they're great,
but I can't find them anywhere.

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,644
I can get those for you in two seconds...

58
00:04:14,745 --> 00:04:17,236
just give me the size and the style number.

59
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,281
Hey, Shauna. What up?

60
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,176
I have an apparel request for Vince.

61
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,551
He needs a pair of Uggs
for his lady friend ASAP.

62
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,425
Yeah.

63
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,226
You don't have a weed guy, do you?

64
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,793
- Hey.
- Hey.

65
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,793
- What are you doing?
- Just reading a script.

66
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:44,268
- Any good?
- It's great so far.

67
00:04:45,676 --> 00:04:50,136
So that's your job? You read some scripts
and tell Vince which the good ones are?

68
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:53,984
Yes, something like that.

69
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:58,150
That's a really cool job.
So did you go to school for that?

70
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,646
No.

71
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,421
I love to read.
I read all the Harry Potter books and...

72
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:08,397
I don't know. If you need a second opinion,
don't hesitate.

73
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,226
Okay. Cool.

74
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,262
- All right.
- Thanks.

75
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,842
Don't get mad,
but I think she's stealing food.

76
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:32,581
- She's not stealing food.
- Shit keeps disappearing from the fridge.

77
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:34,748
Did have an eye on the meatloaf, vanish.

78
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:38,624
I know how these kleptos work.
First it's the food, then it's the plasma.

79
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,391
All right. She didn't steal it,
she threw it away.

80
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,265
- Thrown it away, why?
- She's vegan.

81
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:49,897
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Means she's into a cruelty-free lifestyle.

82
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:53,437
It's cruel to throw away
a $65.00 steak from Morton's.

83
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:57,446
Just do me a favor, and keep the meat
out of her eye line while she's around.

84
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,641
Look, she's already got him
wearing cloth shoes.

85
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,187
These are my slippers. They are the ones
he stole from the Four Seasons, Maui.

86
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,552
Those are the slippers? Where's the robe?

87
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,149
Fiona just dropped the robe at the pool
and had nothing on underneath.

88
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,125
- She's naked at the pool?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:14,697
- And you were looking at her?
- She's naked at the pool.

90
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:16,925
- How's she look?
- Good enough to eat, I bet.

91
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:20,299
- Yeah.
- Too bad Vince can't eat animal products.

92
00:06:21,438 --> 00:06:23,235
I'm going up. You mind?

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,706
- Yeah, I mind.
- Sue me, I'm going.

94
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:28,968
- Vince.
- Did you call the Hack?

95
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,139
- Yeah. He's got nothing.
- How can the whole town be out of weed?

96
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:35,741
Hack said the drought dried up the crops.
It ain't on me. Peace.

97
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,915
- Three days, Vince. Don't bend the rules.
- I made the rules.

98
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:44,059
- Can we talk about something important?
- This is important, it's a lifestyle issue.

99
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:46,527
Did you see the picture
of the swami in the bathroom?

100
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,619
It's her guru.

101
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:50,359
I don't like the way he looks at me
when I'm pissing.

102
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,662
- I found your next movie, Vince.
- Yeah?

103
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,466
The script is awesome,
you got to read it now.

104
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:58,639
Vince, I need you.

105
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,437
I'll read it later. All she wants to do is fuck.

106
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,814
The idea is to get as close as possible
without actually touching.

107
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:15,482
How long do we have to go for?

108
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:17,958
The longer we hold out, the better the sex.

109
00:07:18,095 --> 00:07:20,393
Sometimes great masters hold out for years.

110
00:07:20,497 --> 00:07:24,331
But they're up in the mountains somewhere
by themselves, whacking off like crazy.

111
00:07:24,568 --> 00:07:26,502
Vince, read that script?

112
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,769
I'm sorry, baby, I'm on a tight schedule.

113
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,577
Here you go, Turtle.
Now you have to stop bothering me.

114
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,876
Thanks, Shauna.
Vince's lady friend is going to love these.

115
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,882
- These are not Taiwanese knockoffs?
- Would I do that to you?

116
00:07:41,985 --> 00:07:44,146
No, those are real goods.
Look at the sheepskin.

117
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,722
You can tell these were born
and raised in the outback.

118
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,314
- Yeah?
- Yeah, absolutely.

119
00:07:48,425 --> 00:07:51,417
- Thanks a mil, Shauna.
- Don't thank me, thank Christy.

120
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:52,529
Christy.

121
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:56,800
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,893
If you ever need anything, you know,
concert tickets, pedicure...

123
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,966
- full body massage...
- How about a stun gun?

124
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:07,076
All right.

125
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,208
Shauna, what's with the photographer?

126
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,839
I told you, I don't want Vince
posing on these things.

127
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,247
I called back and said...

128
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:16,842
if he wants the Harley,
he has to take a picture on it.

129
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,286
- We never had that discussion.
- I had it with Turtle.

130
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:22,051
- And I spoke with Vince.
- That's all I give a shit about:

131
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:25,458
What Vincent wants. So don't fuck with me
like you're fucking with Ari.

132
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,391
Hey, Eric, I read it, it's awesome.

133
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:31,160
- Read what?
- The script, it's so good.

134
00:08:31,568 --> 00:08:34,264
- You read it?
- God, it even made me cry. Right, Vince?

135
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,565
Yeah, it did.

136
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:40,837
Hey, Shauna, just so you know.
Look, you know I love you...

137
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:44,644
- but I can't take a picture on that thing.
- Turtle said you'd do it.

138
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:47,979
It's just my girl, she's really conscious
about the environment...

139
00:08:48,085 --> 00:08:49,814
she thinks it sends the wrong message.

140
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,617
I mean, she doesn't mind riding around
in your Hummer. What is she thinking?

141
00:08:53,724 --> 00:08:57,091
I don't know what she is thinking,
but I can't be hassled.

142
00:08:57,194 --> 00:08:59,355
Vince, you're totally fucking me on this.

143
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:00,756
I'll take the picture.

144
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,855
What am I going to do
with your fucking picture?

145
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:06,367
Give me back those Uggs.
I know they're not for him, you fat midget.

146
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,496
You're going to have to pull them
from my cold, dead hands.

147
00:09:09,606 --> 00:09:10,698
Oh, really?

148
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:14,301
Good boy, Arnold.

149
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,580
- What are you doing?
- You didn't call bank shot.

150
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,380
- I did. You didn't hear me.
- You got to learn to project.

151
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,751
You hire a vocal coach,
you become a real asshole.

152
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,221
E, the script's great.

153
00:09:27,324 --> 00:09:28,552
- You read it?
- Yeah.

154
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,684
- How many pages?
- The whole thing.

155
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:32,590
Right. How does it end?

156
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:35,158
What are you, an asshole?

157
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,897
I tell you I got your next movie,
you ignore me...

158
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,798
Fiona likes it, you read it in an hour?

159
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,873
- I read it, what's the difference?
- I don't know, but there is one.

160
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:43,305
- I read it, what's the difference?
- I don't know, but there is one.

161
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,398
Don't worry about that. Let's get it together.

162
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:47,773
Call Ari and find out
why he doesn't know about it.

163
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,211
- Yeah. Go call Ari, get us paid.
- Shut up, Turtle.

164
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,243
Vince, you seen any juicy parts for me?

165
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,081
- Maybe you could play his father.
- Fuck you.

166
00:09:59,222 --> 00:10:01,122
- Ari Gold's office.
- Hey.

167
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:04,022
<i>- Hey, you left your wallet at my house.</i>
- Did I?

168
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:07,222
Yes. Is that your way of saying
you want to come back?

169
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:08,298
<i>Sort of, yeah.</i>

170
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:12,699
We read a script that we love.
Any way Ari is free for lunch?

171
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:14,236
<i>Like in December.</i>

172
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:17,205
Hold on.
Let me just take care of something for you.

173
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:21,309
All right, I just rescheduled
Anthony LaPaglia.

174
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,745
- Thanks.
<i>- I'll see you tonight?</i>

175
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,211
- Okay. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

176
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,912
- Pussy.
- Faggot.

177
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:37,493
Yeah, I'll get the Full Mung Bean Meatloaf.

178
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:39,562
Okay.

179
00:10:40,564 --> 00:10:43,499
What the fuck are we doing here?
I'm on Atkins, I need protein.

180
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,830
Come on, there's plenty of protein
in mung beans.

181
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,801
I'm talking about real proteins,
like man protein.

182
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:49,633
Like from the flesh of slaughtered animals.

183
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,675
Got to have war paint on them,
blood dripping. It's what I need.

184
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:55,506
Have you seen a video
of a slaughterhouse, Ari?

185
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:57,102
Meat is murder.

186
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:59,774
Even broccoli screams
when you rip it from the ground.

187
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:03,010
Enough about the fucking menu.
Can we talk about <i>Queens Boulevard?</i>

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,954
- Yeah Ari, I really want to do this.
- It's the best script I ever read.

189
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:11,123
- She's reading your scripts now?
- Vince asked me to.

190
00:11:11,395 --> 00:11:12,362
He did?

191
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,525
Do you guys have a problem with that?

192
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:19,625
No, if you don't mind it not being printed
on recycled paper.

193
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:20,998
What's the matter, E?

194
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:24,039
Did the big words overwhelm you?
Had to pass it along?

195
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,166
Well, I read it.
You didn't even know about it.

196
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:29,575
I knew about it.
You think you knew about it and I didn't?

197
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,479
You think there is anything in this universe
that you know, that I don't know?

198
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:36,417
- Vince, can I talk to you, please?
- Yeah.

199
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:41,885
First rule of being a manager:
Control the star's fucking girlfriend.

200
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,722
'Cause Yoko Ono is macro-psychotic.

201
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:46,829
- What's wrong?
- Heard what he said about meat.

202
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,261
I know, baby, I'm sorry.

203
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:49,992
I don't know, I'm gonna wait outside.

204
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,092
- Your agent is a karmic disaster.
- Okay, I'll see you out there.

205
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:54,898
- I'll be like five minutes.
- All right.

206
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,974
Excuse me. I was wondering
if you could take a picture with us.

207
00:11:58,075 --> 00:11:59,372
Sure, why not.

208
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:04,240
Hey, idiot, you know that Scott Wick
is my best friend.

209
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:06,006
Who is Scott Wick, asshole?

210
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:08,311
He is the producer of the movie,
you dumb fuck.

211
00:12:08,418 --> 00:12:11,353
Then it should be fucking easy,
don't you think, douche bag?

212
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:14,049
No, Eric, it shouldn't,
because what you don't know...

213
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:16,682
you little garlic knot-making motherfucker...

214
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:18,761
is that Wick hates Vince.

215
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:22,559
You got him excited about the script,
how'd you like to break that news to him?

216
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,190
Okay, I'll do that.

217
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,164
The producer of the movie thinks you suck.

218
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,538
Now what, Ari?

219
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:40,406
Is it all right if I hang out with you guys?

220
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,745
It's a free sidewalk.

221
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:45,848
- Bite?
- No, thank you.

222
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,923
You're telling me you can't find anyone
on the West Coast who has a joint?

223
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,584
You're slacking, Hack.

224
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,166
He's sending a recon team up to
Humboldt County, but he's not hopeful.

225
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,399
You guys in need of weed?

226
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:00,731
What do you know about it?

227
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:03,533
I got a Sherpa who grows 100% organic.

228
00:13:03,807 --> 00:13:05,399
No herbicides, no pesticides.

229
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:09,138
Like we are going all the way to Everest
to score weed from your Sherpa.

230
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,235
Come on, you guys.

231
00:13:10,347 --> 00:13:12,838
He doesn't live in Everest anymore,
he lives in Bel Air.

232
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,716
What's a Sherpa?

233
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,552
This guy sells weed out of his house?

234
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:25,127
Yeah, even the carpet is made out of hemp.
It's cool.

235
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:26,829
Just stepped in shit.

236
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:30,193
Come on, guys.

237
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,844
Holy shit.

238
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,452
Field of fucking dreams.

239
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:53,918
I said check the resins
in the vegetation chamber.

240
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:56,288
It's the new thing with lights on.

241
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:01,053
- Hey, baby.
- Dakatoka!

242
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:03,694
How're you doing?

243
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:07,769
That's her channel name.
Fiona's channel name is Dakatoka.

244
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:11,065
You are an ancient wisdom giver.

245
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:12,837
Who, Fiona is?

246
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:20,107
Johnny Drama?

247
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,081
I'm Johnny Drama.

248
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm a fan, man.

249
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:27,816
When's the next season
of <i>Viking Quest,</i> dude?

250
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,657
It got cancelled seven years ago.

251
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,759
- Bummer.
- Yeah.

252
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:42,327
Euridice, Atena,
we're gonna have a little tea...

253
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,064
mix some ancient Mayan mule shit.

254
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:47,174
It's hybrid.

255
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,049
Drama.

256
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,812
Earth is moving.

257
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:29,383
Did you feel that?

258
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,778
Everything all the time.

259
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:35,850
There's dimensions we can't even see.

260
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:40,290
Everything is evolving...

261
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,189
Turtle, you are a dove.

262
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,594
That's cool. Can I hit that, Sherp? Thanks.

263
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,739
Aren't you afraid of getting busted?

264
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,670
Busted, I'm entrusted.

265
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:55,907
I don't steal, I heal.

266
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,714
Not getting stoned, getting honed.

267
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:05,917
My probation officer
is one of my best customers.

268
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,450
I'm a prisoner of war.

269
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,622
War on drugs.

270
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:16,890
Sounds so negative, man.

271
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:22,505
I mean the man's most positive,
positive "tive" is a negative.

272
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,529
It's a mega negative.

273
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:26,475
Right?

274
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:28,138
Fight grass!

275
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,840
Let them be low, we are getting high.

276
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,317
We're not getting fucked down...

277
00:16:36,786 --> 00:16:37,878
we're getting fucked up.

278
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,455
That's awesome.
I think that went out, though.

279
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:46,687
Don't touch that!

280
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:54,100
It's cool, Finley, cell phone.

281
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,733
- Is it cool?
- Please, enjoy.

282
00:17:05,582 --> 00:17:06,810
I'm vibrating.

283
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,272
Hello.

284
00:17:08,385 --> 00:17:11,115
Call me Helen Keller,
'cause I'm a fucking miracle worker.

285
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:12,210
7:00 at Maestros...

286
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,654
you're gonna break bread with Wick,
and don't be late.

287
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,453
<i>And tell Vince to wear something tight.</i>

288
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,958
Yeah. Okay.

289
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:20,993
Sorry about that.

290
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:24,632
Ari delivered Wick. We have dinner
at Maestros at 7:00.

291
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,497
I'm over that project, dude.

292
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:29,103
What? I thought you loved the script.

293
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,433
I'll love another.

294
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,509
I'm not wasting my time with some guy
who doesn't like me.

295
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,137
There are no others, trust me.
I know, I'm the one who reads them.

296
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,713
When this guy meets you, he'll love you.

297
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,016
Oh, yeah.

298
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,517
Free steak, what the fuck.

299
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,888
I'm dying for some red meat.

300
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:52,461
Anybody need some clean urine?

301
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:57,961
You're fucking whipped, bro.

302
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,926
Will you stop it already?

303
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,025
It's true, though.

304
00:18:01,137 --> 00:18:03,332
I mean, this girl tells you
what pictures to make...

305
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,738
what scripts to read,
what dinners to go to. Come on...

306
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,902
where's your fucking balls?

307
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,776
E, don't freak, all right?

308
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:16,014
I love her, I want to marry her.

309
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:21,451
- I'm fucking with you. Relax, bro.
- That's not funny.

310
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:23,224
Look, she's leaving on Friday...

311
00:18:23,326 --> 00:18:25,760
she's going to an ashram in India
for four months.

312
00:18:25,862 --> 00:18:27,329
In that case, I love her.

313
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,297
- No problem. She's gone.
- Got to get her out of here.

314
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,992
- Gentlemen, Scott Wick.
- Hello.

315
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:35,928
Let's make this snappy.

316
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:38,741
Be nice.

317
00:18:43,246 --> 00:18:44,213
Beluga.

318
00:18:45,148 --> 00:18:46,672
- Excuse me?
- Caviar.

319
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,575
Reminds me of a cold winter night
in Novgorod.

320
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:52,678
Where is Novgorod?

321
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:55,586
It's in Russia.

322
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,884
He didn't know that
'cause he dropped out of college.

323
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:00,656
So what did you do in Russia?

324
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:02,890
My father was an American diplomat.

325
00:19:03,132 --> 00:19:05,464
That's nice, my father was a douche bag.

326
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,531
I'm gonna get the New York Strip...

327
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,967
because it reminds me
of my childhood in New York.

328
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:14,304
That's funny.

329
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:18,442
So, Scott, listen,
we want to talk to you about the script.

330
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,106
Vince wants to do it.

331
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,348
I read it and I loved it.

332
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:24,280
I appreciate that, boys...

333
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:27,550
but unfortunately, I just don't see you in it.

334
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:31,423
This movie is about a guy from Queens.

335
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:33,389
It's a kid from the neighborhood.

336
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:36,226
Vince is a guy from Queens,
he's from the neighborhood.

337
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,391
He doesn't feel like he is.

338
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,828
Where does he feel like he's from?

339
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,829
- The Appalachians.
- Come on.

340
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,005
You know what? With all due respect...

341
00:19:47,176 --> 00:19:49,701
I grew up a block
from where the script takes place...

342
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,279
in a shitty little apartment...

343
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,873
with five brothers and sisters
and a psychotically drunk father.

344
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,508
I am this part.

345
00:19:56,853 --> 00:20:01,517
Yes, but you know that even the truth
sometimes seems fake, wouldn't you say?

346
00:20:02,392 --> 00:20:04,952
This doesn't seem like it's going anywhere,
does it?

347
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:06,153
Not really.

348
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:08,721
I'm gonna order a little extra.

349
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:12,260
Maybe I'll get this rib-eye to go.

350
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,527
Bring a little doggy bag home for the boys.

351
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,605
Do I look like Goodwill to you?

352
00:20:16,773 --> 00:20:18,138
What are you, high?

353
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,172
Actually, Scott, I am.

354
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,143
Is that a problem?

355
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,071
- Where did you get it?
- A friend of mine.

356
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:29,343
Some of the best shit I've ever smoked.
Are you in need?

357
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:30,452
I am.

358
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,620
My guy says the town is dry,
something about a drought.

359
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:36,316
Is your guy Black Hack?

360
00:20:37,093 --> 00:20:40,551
My guy spoke to another guy.
I don't really have a guy.

361
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:42,492
I could hook you up.

362
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:45,796
What are we doing here,
talking about the script or weed?

363
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,767
Maybe both, E. Maybe both.

364
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:56,078
Oh, Christ.

365
00:20:57,046 --> 00:21:00,846
I have to lie at my N.A. Meeting again.

366
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:07,283
Can I ask you a question?

367
00:21:08,024 --> 00:21:10,458
Why do you have to be such a hardass
all the time?

368
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,989
I don't know...

369
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,898
because it's just fucking fun.

370
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:24,632
- Shit.
- This should be fun.

371
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:29,302
Give me one of those...
Cocksucker, motherfucker.

372
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:31,707
Relax, you said your dad's a diplomat,
right?

373
00:21:31,814 --> 00:21:34,214
That was 50 fucking years ago, asshole.

374
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:36,842
- Just roll down the window.
- I'm on fucking probation.

375
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:37,920
For what?

376
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:41,251
It was nothing, it wasn't anything,
it wasn't even true.

377
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:43,820
Hello, Officer.

378
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:46,288
- License and registration.
- Sure.

379
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:50,529
Here we go.

380
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,361
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, Mr. Wick.

381
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:58,206
You're parked in a red zone.

382
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,535
Step out of the car, please.

383
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,736
- Lf you like, I can just move.
- Sir!

384
00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:04,813
- Out of the car.
- Excuse me, Officer.

385
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:06,404
Hi, how are you?

386
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:11,815
You know Officer Hecht? His daughter,
Melissa, is a good friend of mine.

387
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:13,352
I know you.

388
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,256
I saw the new trailer, movie looks good.

389
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,084
Yes, it's a good film.

390
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:19,653
It is good.

391
00:22:22,532 --> 00:22:26,059
Not only does he not bust us for
smoking weed or parking in the red zone...

392
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:27,932
he asked this guy for his autograph.

393
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:30,232
- Awesome.
- What can I say, I'm above the law.

394
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:31,465
Let's toast.

395
00:22:31,607 --> 00:22:33,472
What is this stuff, is it weed or grass?

396
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:34,941
Whatever, it's good for you.

397
00:22:35,044 --> 00:22:37,808
I don't trust this shit.
I lived on this stuff in '93.

398
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,280
By the end of the year
I was sleeping standing up.

399
00:22:40,383 --> 00:22:42,214
Come on guys, a goodbye toast.

400
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:45,481
- You really gonna leave us?
- I could cancel my trip.

401
00:22:45,588 --> 00:22:46,987
No, don't do that.

402
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,422
We wouldn't want you to bum out Ramdash.

403
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:50,617
Ram Dass.

404
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,927
Whatever.

405
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:54,060
All right, on the count of three.

406
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,152
Three.

407
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,034
That's disgusting.

408
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:02,393
Hello.

409
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,132
- Mini Vince.
<i>- Hey, Ari.</i>

410
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,968
I don't know who blew who...

411
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:10,205
but Wick's got a crush on your boy Vince,
wants him to star in his vanity project.

412
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:11,505
All right, I'll tell him.

413
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:14,649
Prepare to enter the poor house,
you little bitch.

414
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,551
Wick wants you in the movie.

415
00:23:20,723 --> 00:23:23,157
I don't know, you think I'm Queens enough?

416
00:23:24,627 --> 00:23:25,594
We'll see.

417
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:28,655
Get another round here.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
