1
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,743
Come on, boy.

2
00:01:28,946 --> 00:01:30,538
Who's a good boy?

3
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,710
"My vagina is a shell,
a round pink tender shell...

4
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,811
"opening and closing and opening.

5
00:01:37,922 --> 00:01:39,685
"My vagina is a flower..."

6
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:42,623
What the fuck is wrong with you?

7
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,091
<i>Vagina Monologues.</i>

8
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:47,019
Me and Faustino
are putting it up in class tonight.

9
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,497
<i>Vagina Monologues,</i>
I thought that was for girls.

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,934
It's a gender reversal exercise, bro.
That's what being a good actor's all about.

11
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,905
Sorry, Drama. I thought you already had
your gender reversed.

12
00:01:57,007 --> 00:01:57,974
Funny, dick.

13
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,942
E., I decided we're going with the Benz.

14
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:03,513
You're sure?
You changed your mind 10 times already.

15
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:06,447
No, I'm set. I had a dream about it last night.

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,179
I dreamt about it last night, too, Vince.
We're cruising down Rodeo.

17
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,278
Suddenly two jerk-offs pull up and say:

18
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,254
"Chase brothers, fuck your mother!"

19
00:02:14,358 --> 00:02:15,723
And then open fire.

20
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:17,851
It had to be a dream.
Somebody recognized you?

21
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:19,156
That's funny.

22
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,655
You're gonna love this. This is really good.

23
00:02:21,765 --> 00:02:25,496
- You put soy milk in these again?
- You're lactose intolerant. Don't fight it.

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:28,333
Vince, they got the stains
out of your black Dolces.

25
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,406
Cool.

26
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:31,600
I only got you nine iPods. They ran out.

27
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:33,904
- Did you get <i>The Trades?</i>
- Right here, boss.

28
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:37,037
- I'm just warning you. It ain't pretty.
- Really?

29
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:39,308
Fucking prick called you a thespian.

30
00:02:40,317 --> 00:02:41,784
Read it out loud, E.

31
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,048
You don't want to hear this, Vince.

32
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,987
Come on, man. I'm a big boy.

33
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:51,026
"In <i>Head On,</i>
a by-the-numbers crime thriller...

34
00:02:51,128 --> 00:02:53,392

beyond a reasonable doubt:

35
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,624
"Vincent Chase is guilty of fraud."

36
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,958
That's fucked up.

37
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,903
Fuck critics. Remember what they said
about me when <i>Viking Quest</i> aired?

38
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,200
Who laughed their way through a full 22?

39
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,435
Keep reading.

40
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,980
"This fly-by-night pretty-boy,

"you wish someone would just let
the man rest."

43
00:03:17,788 --> 00:03:20,723
- At least he said I was pretty.
- All the Chase men are pretty.

44
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:23,156
Yeah. You're a real beauty queen, Drama.

45
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:26,761
- You all right?
- Yeah. Whatever.

46
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:29,526
Good or bad, you can't let
what these people say affect you.

47
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:32,898
- That's right. 'Cause you're a fucking star.
- True knocking.

48
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,594
All right. We got Ari in 30 minutes. So...

49
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:38,141
Johnny, you still need some help
with that scene?

50
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:41,336
From a no-talent pretty boy like you?
I think I'll pass.

51
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:48,479
- Loretta, how you doing?
- Hi, beautiful.

52
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,985
How you doing?

53
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,287
Four o'clock.

54
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:13,766
- Who's that girl? She's cute as hell.
- That was fucking Justine Chapin, bro.

55
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:16,072
- The singer?
- No way that girl's a virgin.

56
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,340
That's what she's famous for.

57
00:04:17,448 --> 00:04:19,746
She's saving it till marriage.
Everybody knows that.

58
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,978
- Bullshit! I don't buy it.
<i>- Teen Beat</i> don't lie.

59
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:25,385
Hey, you guys, I'm Emily,
Ari's new assistant.

60
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:27,548
- Hi.
- You are new, honey.

61
00:04:27,658 --> 00:04:30,786
It's good to meet guys from Queens.
My dad's from Flushing.

62
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:32,953
- Yeah?
- Yeah? Where'd you grow up?

63
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,261
I grew up out here.
But don't hold that against me.

64
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,063
- Can I offer you anything to drink?
- I'll have a water.

65
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,727
Yeah, I'll have a water.

66
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:42,601
You got Welch's Grape Soda?

67
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:45,840
He's in a meeting.
Can he call you back, please?

68
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,001
Thank you.

69
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,980
Ari Gold's office. Please hold.

70
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:53,817
It's the girl's first day.
You really needed to hassle her?

71
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:57,114
You order something unusual,
people will never forget you.

72
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,820
I think E.'s got something for that Emily.

73
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,323
Seriously.
'Cause I'm always ordering weird shit...

74
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:04,826
and now, all of a sudden,
it's become a problem?

75
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,396
- You like Emily?
- I don't even know the girl.

76
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:09,022
- I'll hook it up.
- Don't do it.

77
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:10,896
Emily, you got a boyfriend?

78
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,535
'Cause my man, E., here
just got his heart broken.

79
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:14,968
He thinks you're kind of cute.

80
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:17,006
Oh, yeah? Which one's E?

81
00:05:19,243 --> 00:05:20,437
How you doing?

82
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:25,437
Lay off the new girl.
She's not broken in yet. Come on in, boys.

83
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:28,784
- Hold everything for me, will you?
- Yeah.

84
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:29,953
Vince. Vince.

85
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:33,746
No representation. Just reminding you.

86
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:40,557
Do me a favor.

87
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:43,823
Make sure I'm off book, okay?

88
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:44,901
Okay.

89
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:46,835
Ari Gold's office. Please hold.

90
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:50,839
"If your vagina could talk,
what would it say, in two words?"

91
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:52,464
Eat me.

92
00:05:53,677 --> 00:05:54,769
Give me that thing.

93
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:56,505
Look at the boy.

94
00:05:56,847 --> 00:06:00,112
Wait for it.
Look at the ass on my next door neighbor.

95
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:03,050
See that? Four kids.
My wife says it's impossible to maintain.

96
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:04,518
You've a good-looking boy, Ari.

97
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:07,181
He likes chicks.
See the glance? Look at that.

98
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,818
What's up with this Justine Chapin chick?

99
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:12,529
Justine Chapin.

100
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,463
Every young actor in Hollywood wants
to be the first one in there. Take a number.

101
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,159
Come on. She's not a virgin.

102
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:19,735
Always the cynic, E.

103
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:23,095
Ari, should we be worried
about this review?

104
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:26,635
No. It's not even a real paper, Vince.
It's <i>Variety.</i>

105
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:29,008
I'm not worried. I think Eric's worried.

106
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:33,072
No, I'm not. I mean, it's a bad review.
I would've preferred a good one, but...

107
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,674
- What's your point?
- My point is, what're we doing?

108
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:36,775
- What are we doing?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:37,854
What are we doing?

110
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:41,982
- What are we doing about Vince's next job?
- I got Vince his next job. It's <i>Matterhorn!</i>

111
00:06:42,092 --> 00:06:45,391
You passed on it, remember?
He passed on your next job, Vince.

112
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:47,828
The guy doesn't want to make money.
He's a communist.

113
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,660
Are you a communist or a socialist?

114
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,928
Or didn't you learn the difference
at Pepperoni U?

115
00:06:52,035 --> 00:06:53,502
And what are you, a Rhodes scholar?

116
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm a lowly Harvard grad
with a J.D.IM.B.A. From Michigan. That's it.

117
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,268
- Michigan? Good football team.
- Yeah.

118
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:00,669
What'd they do at Harvard?

119
00:07:00,778 --> 00:07:02,040
- They row.
- No, they crew.

120
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,135
- Crew.
- They crew.

121
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,943
Vince, we gotta get you a real manager.

122
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,480
Cash.
Where are those scripts we talked about?

123
00:07:11,588 --> 00:07:13,920
Emily, scripts!
I pay my dog-walker $4,000 a month.

124
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:15,855
- Wanna play the Riv tomorrow?
- Yeah, let's hack it up.

125
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,948
You caddie?

126
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,255
I'll caddie for you the day you outdrive me.

127
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,957
Really? Then you're caddying.
Everybody wins.

128
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,726
Just call me if the pages
printed out too light or anything.

129
00:07:26,837 --> 00:07:28,065
Okay. I will.

130
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,138
My brother needs an agent.

131
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:33,966
I got Billy in the mailroom.
He needs his first client.

132
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,408
We'll hook him up. I'm kidding.

133
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:38,345
We're golden. We're in great shape.
What're you talking about?

134
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:40,313
We're in great shape.
We're gonna open huge.

135
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,113
Hang back.
I want to bounce some scripts off your boy.

136
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,814
- Keep me posted.
- You got it. Keep your cell phone on.

137
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,618
Put those down. Come here.

138
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:56,062
Where's your bedside manner, dummy?
Why did you bring up a bad review?

139
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:58,293
- You said it didn't matter.
- It does matter.

140
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:00,097
Everyone in this town reads that thing.

141
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,265
I got more calls about this stupid-ass thing
than I did when my mother passed away.

142
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:08,333
We got 200 reviews coming out on Friday.
If they're like this, we're in deep shit.

143
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:11,903
That's why you book your next job
before the movie comes out.

144
00:08:12,216 --> 00:08:13,205
Altoid?

145
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:22,225
Take him out, keep him happy, all right?

146
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:24,453
He's got meetings coming up,
scripts to read.

147
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,756
He must keep focused.
Have a good time with him.

148
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,856
- Keep his mind off that fucking review.
- Yeah. You're right.

149
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,299
We in this together? Are we in it together?

150
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,597
- Yeah. You're right.
- I'm kidding.

151
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,563
- Don't fucking mention that review again!
- I'm not.

152
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,137
You want to hug it out?

153
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:41,677
- No, not really.
- Let's hug it out, bitch.

154
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:42,813
Let's hug it out.

155
00:08:45,048 --> 00:08:47,744
You remember
<i>The Orange County Register</i> said...

156
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,614
I was a functioning retard.

157
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:52,950
- Now, that was a bad review.
- I thought that was a compliment.

158
00:08:53,056 --> 00:08:55,524
You should come and check out
this class with me.

159
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:58,618
You gotta audition to get in.
But since you're legacy...

160
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,492
You think I need an acting class?

161
00:09:00,597 --> 00:09:03,657
You don't need an acting class, Vince.
Let's go get you a car.

162
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,359
What did Ari say?

163
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:08,438
Good stuff. I got a box of scripts to read.

164
00:09:09,306 --> 00:09:11,706
- So it's all good?
- Yeah, it's all good.

165
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:14,971
- Let's go get you a Benz.
- Fuck the fucking Mercedes, Vince.

166
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:18,775
What are you, a soccer mom?
You want a car? I know what to get you.

167
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:28,686
Vincent Chase!

168
00:09:29,526 --> 00:09:31,892
My daughter's a huge fan.

169
00:09:32,462 --> 00:09:34,953
- What are we looking at today?
- The Phantom.

170
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,226
Excellent choice.

171
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:41,501
This is the ultimate luxury motorcar,
gentlemen.

172
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:43,933
Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z.

173
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,532
Queen Latifah purchased one
for her manager.

174
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,146
When you drive a Rolls-Royce,
you are making a statement.

175
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,608
And how expensive is this statement?

176
00:09:52,716 --> 00:09:55,378
- $320,000.
- Not bad.

177
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:59,681
But if you sign a picture for my daughter,
I'll give it to you for $319,000.

178
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:03,451
How much if he bangs his daughter?

179
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,552
You don't buy this car, Vince. You lease it.

180
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:09,530
That's how all the broke jerk-offs
in this town drive 911s.

181
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:12,158
We have excellent terms on our lease.

182
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,293
What do you think, E?

183
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,735
I think it costs more than
the houses we grew up in.

184
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,740
A fucking Subaru costs more
than the houses we grew up in.

185
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:20,002
I don't know.

186
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,107
- Think I should buy this car?
- Come on, are you serious?

187
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:27,240
- You're gonna spend $320,000 on a car?
- So you don't think I should do it.

188
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:30,244
I didn't say you shouldn't do it.

189
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,189
- Lf you wanna do it, do it.
- So I'm gonna do it.

190
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,815
Do it, Vince. Do it, baby.

191
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,120
Do it, Vince.

192
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:40,424
Fuck it, do it.

193
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:44,590
What did you say
your daughter's name was again, Randy?

194
00:10:58,548 --> 00:11:00,243
Yo, this car makes driving fun.

195
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,840
I might even get my license.

196
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,920
We should've had
one of these in high school.

197
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:06,080
Why? You think that
would've gotten you laid?

198
00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:08,054
More than my yellow Fiero did.

199
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:11,559
Shit. I got crazy pussy in high school.
And I was driving a moped.

200
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:14,061
Roll down the windows.
We're stinking this beast up.

201
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,758
No, it's cool. I hate the smell of a new car.

202
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,272
Yo, check this out.

203
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,404
Nice car!

204
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,977
- Thanks.
- What do you do?

205
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,479
Me? I'm a lottery winner, sweetheart.
Powerball.

206
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:33,839
You girls wanna party?

207
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,009
You look familiar. How do I know you?

208
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,110
You watch Cinemax at 5:00 a. M?

209
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,752
Call two friends. Follow us.

210
00:11:40,957 --> 00:11:42,652
- All right.
- Not too close.

211
00:11:58,809 --> 00:11:59,969
Hello?

212
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,507
Marv, how you doing?

213
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,478
I can't hear you.
I got water in my ears. Talk to E.

214
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,275
It's Marvin.

215
00:12:06,383 --> 00:12:07,509
Hey, Marvin.

216
00:12:08,518 --> 00:12:10,349
Yeah. I guess so.

217
00:12:11,221 --> 00:12:13,781
Okay. See you then. Bye.

218
00:12:15,826 --> 00:12:17,691
He wants us to come up to his office.

219
00:12:17,794 --> 00:12:20,695
No, I'm not gonna listen to him
tell me how to spend my money.

220
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,288
He's your business manager.
That's what you pay him for.

221
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,460
So you go listen to him.
That's what I'm paying you for.

222
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,936
So, what? Is he, like, your boss?

223
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,997
- Yeah. Something like that.
- E.'s got a boss!

224
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,068
And who's your boss, Turtle?

225
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:38,511
What'd you say? I can't hear you, dick.

226
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,148
Thank God I'm self-employed.

227
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:46,478
He must have been out of his mind
buying a $300,000 Rolls-Royce!

228
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,320
- He didn't buy it, Marvin. He leased it.
- That's even worse.

229
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:52,020
Because if he bought it,
in a pinch, we could sell it.

230
00:12:52,129 --> 00:12:54,222
You're supposed to be
the one with some smarts.

231
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,925
- What's the matter with you?
- What am I supposed to do?

232
00:12:57,033 --> 00:13:00,264
He wanted the car, he got it.
I can't tell him how to spend his money.

233
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,966
But you got enough balls to tell him
to pass on a $4 million fucking movie offer.

234
00:13:05,342 --> 00:13:07,276
The script sucked, Marvin.

235
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:09,174
He wants artistic integrity?

236
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,303
Then, let him drive around in a Prius.

237
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,813
This isn't my fault. All right?

238
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:16,215
Ari's got my head fucked up.
He told me to get his mind off the review.

239
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:18,048
You guys are out of control.

240
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:21,556
$2,500 a month his brother spends
on vitamin supplements.

241
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:25,652
Nobody could take that many supplements
and still fucking live.

242
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:29,121
Turtle's got a $1,500 a month cell phone bill.

243
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:32,963
You can get an unlimited plan for $200.
Get him an unlimited plan!

244
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,434
I'll get him free weekends.

245
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:38,065
Don't be a wise guy.
Come on, get the fuck out of here. I'm busy.

246
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:39,734
And, Eric...

247
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,101
don't forget to get your parking validated.

248
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:51,079
Hey, asshole! Not so close to the Rolls.

249
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:52,746
All right. Relax, guy.

250
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,958
- I say we move to the 'Bu.
- The what?

251
00:13:58,061 --> 00:14:01,861
- Malibu, baby. We'll learn to surf.
- I don't care where we move. Find a place...

252
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,126
where this clown
doesn't have to use my bathroom.

253
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,201
What's the problem?

254
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,896
The problem is you're filthy,
and you use all my products.

255
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:09,062
What products?

256
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:12,369
I found my Kiehl's open
next to one of your beat-off mags.

257
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,768
- So?
- So, A: Stop using my bathroom.

258
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:19,371
And B: Why do gotta use
$47 lotion to whack off with?

259
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:21,540
I got sensitive skin.

260
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:24,119
- What's up, fellows?
- We're looking at houses.

261
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,246
Houses?
What's wrong with the one we've got?

262
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:29,018
Car's too nice for our place.
We got to step it up a level.

263
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,558
Check out this one.

264
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,961
- It's $10 million.
- Yeah. But it's nice.

265
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:39,367
This is L.A. This year, it's worth $10 million,
next year, $20 million.

266
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:41,232
But it's this year, and it's $10 million.

267
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,432
Hack's got a mortgage broker, E.
Says money's real cheap now.

268
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:47,101
He's talking out of his ass.
Do you know what that means?

269
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,008
Not really.
But if Hack said it, it must be good.

270
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:52,577
Guess who?

271
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:57,019
Edward James Olmos.

272
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,987
Right! You didn't even say his name right.

273
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,221
- How are you?
- How you doing?

274
00:15:02,325 --> 00:15:05,886
- Good. Nice to see you. Hey, boys.
- What's going on?

275
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,896
- Hi, Jessica.
- Nice to see you.

276
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:11,200
I read the thing in the <i>Variety.</i>

277
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,166
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,798
No. The guy was such an asshole.

279
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,236
- You were great.
- Really?

280
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,934
Yeah. You were fantastic. Wasn't he great?

281
00:15:20,043 --> 00:15:22,773
- You were great.
- Thank you.

282
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:25,177
So what are you doing tonight?

283
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:27,341
Tonight? I don't know.
What do you have in mind?

284
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,419
I'm having a party for my friend, Justine.
She's going on tour.

285
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,011
Yeah, we saw her today.
Justine Chapin, right?

286
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:35,853
- Yeah.
- She's cute. What's her deal?

287
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:38,551
Not a chance. She's saving herself.

288
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,526
Come on. Is that really true?

289
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,158
Yeah. For this album, at least.
So, are you guys coming?

290
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,428
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

291
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:47,594
We'll be there.

292
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:49,672
I'll see you later. Glad I ran into you.

293
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:53,470
- Nice to see you. See you tonight.
- Bye.

294
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,307
Jessica Alba.

295
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,974
That's gonna be off the hook.

296
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,683
What about your class, Drama?

297
00:15:59,683 --> 00:15:59,944
What about your class, Drama?

298
00:16:01,484 --> 00:16:04,715
Fuck that class.
They ain't paying me to be there, bro.

299
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,989
You gotta pop the pop star's cherry.
It'd be great press.

300
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:12,789
- No. Virgins are too much responsibility.
- I'll do it. I could use the press.

301
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:15,694
- She's not a virgin.
- She is. I can tell by the way she sings.

302
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,767
That's right. Virgins do know virgins.

303
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,597
Look who's talking,
Mr. Beg-for-pussy-on-prom-night.

304
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,228
I was begging my girlfriend, Turtle.

305
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,433
Not a $40 hooker
who declined your mother's credit card.

306
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,367
Claudia, remember her?

307
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,685
So, who was your first, Drama?

308
00:16:37,987 --> 00:16:40,615
Tracy Richter. It was a mess.

309
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:44,057
I always hoped I'd get to re-fuck her.
You know, do it right.

310
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,061
- How about you, Vince? Who was your first?
- I don't know.

311
00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,391
You don't know?

312
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:52,025
- Fuck that. Everybody remembers their first.
- Yeah? Well, I don't.

313
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:56,299
I remember your first. It was Cindy Davis,
behind the arcade at Nathan's.

314
00:16:56,606 --> 00:17:00,064
- Yeah, you may be right.
- "Yeah, you may be right." Bullshit.

315
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,144
I don't believe for a second
you don't remember your first.

316
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,304
Like I don't believe
Justine Chapin's a virgin.

317
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,383
What kind of virgin has a snake tat
pointing down to her box?

318
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,349
You're both hiding something.

319
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,679
That's $253.

320
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:14,521
- $253. Nice bottle of wine.
- It's for Jessica Alba, E.

321
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,524
You can't give her Boone's Farm.

322
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:18,355
You want some of this?

323
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:22,892
Save that signature, baby.

324
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:48,347
Hey, guys!

325
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,255
- Jessica!
- How are you?

326
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:52,561
Hello, how are you?

327
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,825
Bar's here, bar's over there,
girls are everywhere...

328
00:17:55,932 --> 00:17:59,595
bathroom's back there,
and I need to steal your friend for a second.

329
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:02,033
All right. See you later.

330
00:18:02,138 --> 00:18:04,572
We're going to the bar, let's go to the bar.

331
00:18:04,674 --> 00:18:07,438
Yeah. Save me a drink.
I'm heading to Silicon Valley.

332
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,535
- What are you drinking?
- Whiskey.

333
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:14,047
You girls seen the new Rolls?

334
00:18:14,984 --> 00:18:18,215
- It's really nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to meet you.

335
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:21,152
I'm gonna leave you two.

336
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:38,438
There she is. Snowcone, how are you?

337
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,933
- My dark angel! Hello, honey.
- Hey, Ari.

338
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,536
- Unbelievable party.
- Thanks.

339
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:45,580
Jason, right?
How you doing? Nice to see you.

340
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:48,173
I think that you could be doing a lot more.

341
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:52,414
- No, I do. I think...
- You're really talking shop right now.

342
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,922
- I am talking shop.
- At my house.

343
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:57,117
- Indeed...
- At my party.

344
00:18:57,227 --> 00:18:59,218
- Yes, yes.
- My agent isn't here.

345
00:18:59,329 --> 00:19:02,696
I know. I slashed her tires. She's
on her hands and knees on Mulholland.

346
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,893
She won't make it, because you want
a statue. You deserve a statue.

347
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:07,026
Can you believe this guy?

348
00:19:07,136 --> 00:19:09,229
You deserve it.
Because your natural energy...

349
00:19:09,339 --> 00:19:11,000
the way you are hasn't been seen yet.

350
00:19:11,107 --> 00:19:14,076
Someone needs to step up
and utilize you for the way you are.

351
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:18,273
You're a self-empowered, interesting woman
and you need to take it. Not an MTV award.

352
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:22,715
But a real one. And I want to be there.
"May I have the envelope?" Let me be there.

353
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,720
- Can I think about it?
- Thinking is bad for your complexion.

354
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:28,518
You shine,
I'll think and make it happen, okay?

355
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,957
Give me three months
to get you out of a leotard.

356
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,153
Warm up those vocal cords, Drama.

357
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,193
- They got karaoke here tonight.
- Yeah, I know.

358
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,564
Should I go with Sinatra
or something a little more poppy?

359
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,770
Yo, Drama. What are you doing here?

360
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:44,999
Me? Why aren't you in class?

361
00:19:45,108 --> 00:19:46,973
'Cause I knew you'd fuck me, you prick!

362
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:49,738
Gender reversal exercise.
What are we, fags?

363
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:52,280
Yeah, I know. Come here. Meet my new girl.

364
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:53,982
Be right back, bro.

365
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,418
- What's up, Ari?
- You having a good time, man?

366
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:03,151
Yeah? It's not all fun and fucking games.
Thanks, bro.

367
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:04,658
What are you talking about?

368
00:20:04,761 --> 00:20:08,788
You told Marvin that I said that it was okay
that Vince buys a fucking Rolls.

369
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:10,297
- Did not.
- You did, you said it.

370
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,197
You fucking said it. You kidding me?

371
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:15,032
Don't ever fucking talk about me
behind my back again.

372
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:18,630
Otherwise, I'll have to fucking kill you.
I got ears everywhere.

373
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:34,117
No, I respect that. If that's what you want.

374
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:37,922
- It's not totally true.
- Which part?

375
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:41,123
I'm not really saving myself for marriage.

376
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,028
So what are you saving yourself for?

377
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:48,600
I'm saving myself for someone special.

378
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,575
- Have you ever been anyone's first?
- No. And I don't plan to be.

379
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:59,514
I don't want to be anyone's first,
and I don't want to be anyone's last.

380
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:04,150
That's too bad.

381
00:21:10,293 --> 00:21:14,730
Doors fly open by itself. Heated back seats,
front seats. Unbelievable.

382
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,376
All right. It was your cousin.

383
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,182
What was my cousin?

384
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:38,776
My first time.

385
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:41,389
You fucked my cousin, Debbie?

386
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:42,788
Not Debbie. Sheryl.

387
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:45,452
I fucked Debbie, too, but not till years later.

388
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:48,792
You're an asshole. You got no shame.

389
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:50,593
What? You got hot cousins.

390
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,230
They had a good time.

391
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,802
Come on. Look at you. You're miserable.

392
00:21:58,274 --> 00:21:59,571
You know what?

393
00:21:59,676 --> 00:22:02,702
Maybe Ari's right.
Maybe you should get a real manager.

394
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:04,537
It was one review, E.

395
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,012
It's not just the review.

396
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:08,879
A million people out there
have more experience than I do.

397
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:13,888
Fuck experience.
Come on, I trust you. You got instincts.

398
00:22:15,158 --> 00:22:18,958
But you know, you're the reason
why I moved out here in the first place.

399
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:22,896
- What are you talking about?
- Third grade. I was trying out for basketball.

400
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,593
You said, "Douche bag,
you're too pretty for basketball.

401
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:27,829
"You know, go try the school play."

402
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:30,902
- Did I say that really?
- Yeah.

403
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:35,341
- I was just an asshole kid, I guess.
- And a lot taller, too.

404
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,638
Look.

405
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:42,984
Take a look. Look where we are.

406
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,613
Did you ever think we'd have this?

407
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,715
Man, enjoy it. Have fun.

408
00:22:50,026 --> 00:22:51,186
Worst comes to worst...

409
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,956
we'll go tear it up in Queens,
like we always have.

410
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:56,657
Fucking Turtle's out front,
christening the Rolls.

411
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:59,530
Great. A day old,
it's already gotta be detailed.

412
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,667
You know what?
We look like assholes in that thing anyway.

413
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,136
Get rid of it. Return it tomorrow, E.

414
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,039
You took a three-year lease.

415
00:23:08,311 --> 00:23:10,074
You'll figure it out.

416
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:12,743
What a view!

417
00:23:14,183 --> 00:23:17,675
We're at a party
with some of the hottest girls in the world...

418
00:23:17,887 --> 00:23:20,549
and we're staring
at a bunch of fucking lights.

419
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,620
- Let's go find you a girl, E.
- Yeah.

420
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:26,289
What about me?

421
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,264
I don't wanna go back to Queens, Vince.

422
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:40,103
- Who the fuck's going back to Queens?
- Nobody's going back to Queens.

423
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:55,224
It's Ari.

424
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,527
Yeah?

425
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:04,293
All right. I'll tell him.

426
00:24:06,169 --> 00:24:08,271
<i>New York Times</i> says
you're the next Johnny Depp.

427
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:08,862
<i>New York Times</i> says
you're the next Johnny Depp.

428
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,607
Cool.

429
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:13,904
You guys wanna go look at houses today?

430
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:15,841
Yeah, baby.

431
00:24:15,945 --> 00:24:19,005
Let's get one with an outdoor pool, though.
I'm getting all pasty.

432
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:21,948
- Indoor pool's overrated.
- Hurry up with that bone, man.

433
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:23,177
It's coming.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
