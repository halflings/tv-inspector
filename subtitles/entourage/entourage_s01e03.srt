1
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,760
Lights Out, it's Johnny Drama!
What's up, man?

2
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,197
You see that? He recognized me.

3
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:19,193
$3 million for eight rounds! It's unreal.
You gotta make a movie to make that much.

4
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:21,230
Are you crazy? Did you see that guy's face?

5
00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,357
No amount of money's
gonna get me in the ring.

6
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:25,731
$50,000, I'd let Klitschko
beat the fuck out of me.

7
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:28,828
I'll beat the fuck out of you for free.
What do you think?

8
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:31,339
I'm telling you,
Klitschko don't hit that hard, man.

9
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,841
You kidding? The guy's Russian.

10
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,571
He's got that Mongolian
Genghis Khan warrior blood in him.

11
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:38,512
I'd do three shots of Stoli
and let him blast away.

12
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,681
You fucking dick.

13
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:42,343
You'd be a dead man.

14
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,082
Yeah, but I'd be flush.
I tell you, I'd let that hit me for free...

15
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:48,222
- Fuck off, asshole.
- It was him.

16
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:50,293
- Relax.
- He didn't mean that.

17
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,021
- Hi, Vince.
- Hi.

18
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:53,960
- How are you?
- Good.

19
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:55,762
I'm Johnny.

20
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,003
Let's go to the bar.

21
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:12,008
- Let's see. What do you guys want?
- Beer, baby.

22
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,107
What did you think of the seats?

23
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,017
- Amazing.
- Two very slow white men.

24
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:19,316
I apologize. But goddamn,
there was some blood.

25
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,890
- You liked the blood?
- Loved it.

26
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:24,518
That was for you. If you see Rob Schneider,
tell him you bought those seats.

27
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:25,617
What do you want to drink?

28
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,399
Listen. Three tequilas would be great,
all right?

29
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,564
- Cheers!
- Good for what ails you.

30
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:39,464
Yes!

31
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:42,979
- Jimmy! Jimmy Kimmel!
- How you doing?

32
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,638
You know Vincent Chase, right?

33
00:03:44,748 --> 00:03:46,375
- Yeah, how are you?
- There you go.

34
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:47,677
- What's happening?
- Big fan.

35
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,447
Thank you. I appreciate it.
We should get you on the show.

36
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:53,489
- Yeah. I'd love to do it, anytime.
- I'd love to have you.

37
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:56,059
Like tomorrow,
we'd love to have you if we could.

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,321
I don't know, you're putting me on the spot.

39
00:03:58,429 --> 00:03:59,828
I know you got the movie.

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,398
- You got a movie coming out Friday.
- It can't hurt.

41
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,194
All right, fuck it. See you tomorrow.

42
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:07,031
- There you go, he's in!
- All right. I'll call you, then?

43
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,968
- Absolutely.
- Very good. Thanks, Ari.

44
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:12,372
Pleased to meet you.
I can't. I don't drink. I'm sorry.

45
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:15,041
I do drink.

46
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:17,613
- Say hello to your brother for me, too.
- Johnny?

47
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,240
Tell him I said hi.
I haven't seen him in a long time.

48
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,410
- He's around here somewhere.
- See you, Jimmy.

49
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,781
There you go. You're in.

50
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,749
So, I got this guy, Rufus.

51
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:29,019
He's got this company called
Home Video Solutions.

52
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:32,057
He just installed
this sweet little home system...

53
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:33,629
in my place on Mulholland.

54
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,360
State-of-the art everything.
I could charge admission at this place.

55
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:38,696
- Really?
- I'm not kidding you.

56
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:42,602
Here's the kicker:
I mention Rufus' name in <i>InStyle.</i>

57
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:45,601
All he charges me for is installation.

58
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:49,142
- Fuck you!
- No. Fuck you, seriously.

59
00:04:49,246 --> 00:04:51,146
Rufus, that's how he does it.

60
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,910
He's a wild cat, Rufus.
I got his card here somewhere.

61
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,485
I'd love that.

62
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:58,314
You still doing that thing with Wes?

63
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:00,549
Yeah. We're gonna start shooting in June.

64
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:03,491
Did you get anyone
to play the part of the partner?

65
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,188
Yeah. Unfortunately,
my brother's gonna do it.

66
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:08,963
He's costly.

67
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:11,701
If he falls out, you think of me, right?

68
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,736
Always. Always thinking of you,
Johnny Drama.

69
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:19,370
- Thanks a lot, Luke. I appreciate it.
- Call Rufus.

70
00:05:23,914 --> 00:05:26,849
Vince, you gonna prepare anything
for the show?

71
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,379
No. That would take all the fun out of
just winging it.

72
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:32,614
The guy's gonna ask you a lot of questions.

73
00:05:32,723 --> 00:05:35,692
Yeah, it's <i>Jimmy Kimmel.</i>
Not <i>60 Minutes,</i> bro.

74
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,785
All right, you'll see.
You should have some stories ready.

75
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:39,988
Hey, ladies.

76
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:43,130
You got any stories I can tell
on <i>Jimmy Kimmel?</i>

77
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,793
You know what? The night's still young.

78
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:48,031
The night is young.

79
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:58,339
- Taste this.
- I am not tasting that, it stinks.

80
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,414
- What the fuck is it?
- It's a new recipe.

81
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:03,247
Tofu spirulina scramble, it's delicious.
Taste it.

82
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:05,116
It smells like dog shit scramble.

83
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:07,281
Eat your Froot Loops and shut up.

84
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,352
- What the fuck smells?
- Open a window, Drama. Jesus Christ!

85
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:15,159
You know what?
Kitchen's closed, fellas. Enjoy cold cereal.

86
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:20,629
- So, you want to talk about Kimmel?
- Jimmy Kimmel?

87
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,764
- Vince is doing the show tonight.
- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.

88
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:27,742
- You're angrier than usual this morning.
- Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.

89
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,813
Why? He said to say hello to you.

90
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:31,437
He's a phony prick.

91
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:34,142
He and I were running buddies
back in the day.

92
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:37,084
That was before
I got kicked off of <i>Melrose Place.</i>

93
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:40,782
The money ran dry. I lost my house.
I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.

94
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:42,791
After that, that was it.

95
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,088
He dropped me like a bad habit.
Never heard from the guy again.

96
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:47,891
I never heard that story.

97
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:50,625
Well, you know me. I don't like to advertise.

98
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:54,429
- Cancel on the prick, Vince.
- He can't cancel.

99
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:58,536
- I can't cancel.
- What are you gonna talk about, though?

100
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:01,975
E., it's a talk show.
They ask you questions. You answer them.

101
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,480
"What's up?" "Not much."
"How you feeling?" "Pretty good."

102
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,380
Don't forget about the time
you tanked on <i>Regis and Kelly.</i>

103
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:10,646
That was a morning show.
We pulled an all-nighter.

104
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:11,880
Plus, who could focus...

105
00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:15,356
with hot-ass Kelly Ripa up there
interrogating you?

106
00:07:16,059 --> 00:07:18,459
- So, what's really bothering you, E?
- What?

107
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:22,089
Are you really concerned about me,
or is this maybe a Kristen issue?

108
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,225
- Yep.
- Don't tell me Kristen's back in the game.

109
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,361
Fuck off. She's picking up her shit
later today. That's all.

110
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,702
I offered to help him box it up
and send it off.

111
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:31,900
But he didn't want that.

112
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,375
Throw her shit in the garbage
and change your number.

113
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,005
Yeah. She comes down here,
you're out of commission for two weeks.

114
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,207
I can't have that.

115
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:42,376
Broken up and still pussy-whipped.
That's just sad.

116
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,182
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.

117
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,588
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.

118
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:51,855
You never ended one. The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.

119
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:53,122
What's not to love?

120
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,358
Look, breaking up is painful.
That's why I never do it.

121
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,697
Why hurt someone
when you can just let it drag on forever?

122
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:02,628
Come on.
You must've broken up with someone.

123
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,440
- No, Johnny. Nobody.
- Bullshit!

124
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:10,305
What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.

125
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:13,245
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.

126
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,751
No, you just started banging
Meredith Tierney at the same time.

127
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,378
Yeah. I liked her, too.

128
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:21,787
I don't know how you get away
with this shit. Lucky guy.

129
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,784
Vince, I was talking to Luke Wilson
last night.

130
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,900
He's got this phat home theater.
I think we should make a play for one.

131
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:33,726
- You couldn't call me?
- It happened last night.

132
00:08:33,837 --> 00:08:36,863
There's a right way to do things
and a wrong way to do things.

133
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,205
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.

134
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,835
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.

135
00:08:42,946 --> 00:08:44,811
Is he gonna get killed for going on <i>Kimmel?</i>

136
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:47,645
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.

137
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:52,211
If you want to do <i>Kimmel,</i> come to me.
I'm your publicist. That's what I'm here for.

138
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:54,813
I gave him the idea for <i>The Man Show.</i>
He loves my ass.

139
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:58,258
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out. Look, I'm serious.

140
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:00,694
You don't want to piss off Letterman
or Leno.

141
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:04,824
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.

142
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,427
I am. But those guys
are vindictive pricks. Here, try this on.

143
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:12,732
- I'm sorry, okay? Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?

144
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,435
- What? <i>Jimmy Kimmel?</i>
- Yeah.

145
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:16,409
I don't know. Maybe. What's the difference?

146
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,004
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.

147
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:20,811
I think he should go with Byblos.

148
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:23,318
If he decides later he doesn't like it,
I'll take it.

149
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,978
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.

150
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:28,785
You should get a few suits to choose
from, so you're not locked into one.

151
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,690
- He doesn't wear suits.
- He does now.

152
00:09:31,795 --> 00:09:34,025
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.

153
00:09:34,131 --> 00:09:36,361
- That's a keeper.
- Nice.

154
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:37,626
Hello.

155
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:41,135
- You should get me on a talk show. I'd kill.
- I'll get you on <i>Springer.</i>

156
00:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,729
Fat, little horny fucks,
and the women that despise them.

157
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,068
What are you laughing at?

158
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,939
Maybe I'll get you on <i>Montel</i>
with Don Swayze...

159
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,479
Joey Travolta
and the other retarded star siblings.

160
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,548
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.

161
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,813
- They're calling back in an hour.
- You're gonna have to do that, E.

162
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,889
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.

163
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,550
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.

164
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,990
That's what makes you a star.

165
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:06,392
You wanna write that down for me
in case I forget?

166
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,361
Yeah. Try this one on, all right?

167
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,728
Yeah, that could be funny.

168
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:14,894
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.

169
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,473
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.

170
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:21,206
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.

171
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,539
What else?

172
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:26,446
Tell him about that stoned-out craft
service girl who blew me after lunch.

173
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,882
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- I'm trying to help.

174
00:10:28,986 --> 00:10:30,476
You're embarrassing me.

175
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:34,648
I was on <i>Arsenio.</i> It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.

176
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:39,322
Let's see. Here's something. I got one.

177
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:43,092
Vince went to the High School
of Performing Arts where they shot <i>Fame.</i>

178
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,694
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.

179
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:51,230
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.

180
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,001
Hold on a second.

181
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,544
You want to do this? This is your interview.

182
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:58,113
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.

183
00:10:58,215 --> 00:10:59,910
You're doing a good job.

184
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:04,448
Yeah. Vince actually...
He's not available right now.

185
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,020
I'll talk to him
and see if we can come up with something.

186
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,855
I'll call you later, okay? Thank you.

187
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:15,487
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.

188
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,157
No. Don't even cancel.

189
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:20,068
Just don't show. That'll really fuck Kimmel.

190
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,296
You'd never cancel.

191
00:11:21,405 --> 00:11:24,203
Why would I cancel
when it's so much fun to watch him freak?

192
00:11:24,307 --> 00:11:27,367
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.

193
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:29,240
Shit. You serious?

194
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,278
- You're fucking dead!
- Fuck you, baby!

195
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,419
Yo, Turtle!

196
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,024
I'm not walking.

197
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:47,830
Sara Foster? That chick is hot.

198
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,422
You think she'll bring other hotties
with her?

199
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,662
- Why would she?
- 'Cause hotties roll in packs, baby.

200
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,764
I never broke up with her, either.

201
00:11:58,341 --> 00:12:01,902
We had that crazy night in the Hamptons.
I never called her again.

202
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,878
I'm not proud of that.
But that's not breaking up.

203
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,248
See? My record's intact.

204
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,783
No asterisk there.

205
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,811
What are you gonna say to her?

206
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,754
What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.

207
00:12:13,857 --> 00:12:17,452
- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?

208
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:20,655
Same thing. Whatever I say when I see her
is what I'll say.

209
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,493
Bullshit. He's gonna cry like a little bitch.

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,261
Cry like a little bitch.

211
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,773
Why are you using Vince as a defense...
Run, Forrest, run!

212
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:35,366
You look great.

213
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,743
Thanks. I'm probably in the best shape
of my life.

214
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:39,975
- You look like shit.
- I do?

215
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,745
Yeah, who's been cutting your hair? Turtle?

216
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,251
No, I just haven't...

217
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:50,120
- Still doing the Pilates?
- When I have time. I'm really busy.

218
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,219
Yeah, me, too. Real busy.
Got no time for anything.

219
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,197
No time for haircuts.
Got a lot of shit going on right now.

220
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,392
- Like what?
- Stuff.

221
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,829
- Really, like what?
- Like stuff. Don't quiz me.

222
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,969
What did you do today?

223
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,502
You don't get my job, you never did.

224
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,204
I shopped and I played golf.
But it's not how it sounds.

225
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,404
Shopping and golf?

226
00:13:10,514 --> 00:13:13,847
Vince is doing <i>Jimmy Kimmel</i> tonight.
I've got to keep his mind focused.

227
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,145
He's on with Sara Foster.
You know who that is?

228
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,654
They had a one-night stand and
he never called her. Can you believe that?

229
00:13:19,756 --> 00:13:22,691
I can. Vince has to break up with girls
before it gets serious.

230
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,316
That way he can't get hurt.

231
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:27,328
Textbook narcissist.
He has major intimacy issues.

232
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,456
- You think that's what it is?
- I'm a Psych major, Eric.

233
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,702
Turtle tells me
you're thinking of buying a house.

234
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,065
Not exactly.

235
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:39,964
Of course. Vince is gonna buy a house,
and you're all gonna live in it.

236
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,839
Yeah. Something like that.

237
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,678
- Fuck.
- What?

238
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,839
What happened to you
getting your own place?

239
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,747
- I am getting my own place.
- When? When Vince dies?

240
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:51,412
When the time is right. Jesus! What?

241
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:55,324
Can't this wait?

242
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:58,955
It's in the second drawer. Jesus!

243
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:03,261
- Vince says hello.
- Great. Look, I gotta go.

244
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:05,664
I was hoping
we weren't going to fight about this.

245
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,637
- I thought you like to fight.
- Only when it leads to make-up sex.

246
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,869
That's not gonna happen.

247
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,978
Wait.

248
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,984
Let's be clear about one thing, okay?

249
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,690
- This isn't make-up sex. It's break-up sex.
- Whatever.

250
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,394
This fucking place is a shithole.

251
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,165
This can't be the place. It looks like a dump.

252
00:14:44,374 --> 00:14:47,502
Luke Wilson's system
was in the neighborhood of $190,000.

253
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:49,110
$190,000?

254
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:52,012
- Can't you do any better?
- No, I can't.

255
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:55,180
I didn't want to have to bring this up,
all right?

256
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:02,191
- I work for a fairly prominent movie star.
- Yeah. Who?

257
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:04,288
- Vincent Chase.
- Really?

258
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,089
He's great.

259
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,064
Maybe you recognize me. I'm his brother.

260
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,155
No.

261
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,326
Anyway, off the record,
my man is doing <i>Jimmy Kimmel</i> tonight.

262
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:17,531
- All right.
- What if we threw in a plug for your outfit?

263
00:15:17,774 --> 00:15:20,572
Would that be cool?
Would that be worth something?

264
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:22,405
I'll tell you what.

265
00:15:22,512 --> 00:15:25,572
You deliver on that promise,
I give you half off.

266
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:28,684
But if he wears this hat...

267
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:30,983
it's free.

268
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,987
So all he has to do is wear the hat?

269
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:37,321
- Check this out.
- She's sweet.

270
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:39,759
Yeah. She's gonna be naked in a second.

271
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:43,693
So, now what?

272
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,664
You wanna go to dinner tomorrow night?
Talk about all this?

273
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,434
Eric, you're really not getting this concept.
This was break-up sex, for real.

274
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,535
So, what, you just had sex with me
as a goodbye?

275
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:57,306
Yeah. It was great.

276
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,412
- I feel dirty.
- Take a shower.

277
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,685
- Tie or no tie?
- No tie.

278
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,989
- What do you know?
- Where are you guys going, church?

279
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,929
- Gotta look nice for the ladies.
- Vince, come on. We're gonna be late.

280
00:16:16,032 --> 00:16:18,432
- What ladies?
- Kimmel's green room.

281
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:21,230
We hear it's stocked like a trout pond.

282
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:23,272
So, how'd it go with Kristen?

283
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:25,705
- We said goodbye.
- After you plowed her?

284
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:30,637
- We had break-up sex, all right?
- "Break-up sex"? Never heard of it.

285
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:34,614
Yeah. You have sex, and then that's it.
You say goodbye.

286
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,278
That's the only kind of sex I have.

287
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,351
- Hey, homey.
- What's up?

288
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,789
- You look like you just rolled out of bed.
- Yeah, I did.

289
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:45,291
You're gonna wear that shirt?

290
00:16:45,495 --> 00:16:46,962
No, it's wrinkled.

291
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,127
I'm gonna wear this one.

292
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,766
- You got style, bro.
- Looks good!

293
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:02,135
<i>We got a good show tonight.</i>

294
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,873
<i>All right, from the movie,</i> The Big Bounce...

295
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,846
<i>Sara Foster, here, tonight!</i>

296
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:11,812
<i>Heard a lot about this.</i>
<i>This movie everybody's talking about...</i>

297
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:15,118
<i>the movie,</i> Head On,
<i>the star of it, Vincent Chase, here, tonight!</i>

298
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,693
- Where are the suits?
- Right here, baby.

299
00:17:19,796 --> 00:17:23,630
Shauna, don't tell Kimmel I'm here.
'Cause he and I have some issues.

300
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,530
Yeah, mum's the word, Drama.

301
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,402
Don't tell me you made notes.

302
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:30,865
Only one.

303
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:34,002
- Home Video Solutions.
- Yes.

304
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,737
You guys go to the green room.
I'm gonna take Vince to makeup.

305
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,542
- Where is it?
- That way.

306
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,383
Vince, extra concealer.
That's the key under house lights.

307
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:47,220
- Good luck, buddy.
- Go get them, baby!

308
00:17:55,999 --> 00:17:59,594
I don't know about the afterlife,
but this life is sweet.

309
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:04,264
- Shall we?
- We shall.

310
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,569
This is bad.

311
00:18:36,339 --> 00:18:37,397
What?

312
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:42,074
- I never called you.
- Please. I never called you.

313
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,347
- Really?
- Really.

314
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,814
Yeah, well, I still feel bad.

315
00:18:50,153 --> 00:18:52,485
I feel worse, trust me.

316
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:56,885
You look incredible.

317
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:00,726
You, too. Come in.

318
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,427
Close the door.

319
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:09,736
You know me, Shauna. I like
to play the field. Keep my options open.

320
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,637
When I settle down, it's gonna be forever.

321
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,602
Weren't you married once already?

322
00:19:15,745 --> 00:19:18,680
Nine days. It was annulled. Next time.

323
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,310
- Ari's late.
- Good.

324
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:28,317
- I'm early.
- Good.

325
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,652
Hey, guys.

326
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:38,894
- You smoke?
- Cigarettes?

327
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:42,300
Yeah, I've been trying to quit recently.

328
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:46,066
- How hard are you trying?
- Not that hard.

329
00:19:46,843 --> 00:19:47,969
Good.

330
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,416
- I thought he quit?
- Cigarettes, not pussy.

331
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,793
Ready in five.

332
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,528
We need 10.

333
00:20:12,035 --> 00:20:16,096
I've tried everything. I tried the patch.
It left a yellow stain on my arm.

334
00:20:16,205 --> 00:20:18,969
- I know. Me, too.
- Have you ever tried Nicorette?

335
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,941
I did, I tried it,
but I couldn't follow the instructions.

336
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:25,014
I never thought chewing gum
could be so complicated.

337
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:28,415
I even tried smoking
only when drinking coffee.

338
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,845
Me, too, I started drinking 25 cups a day.

339
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:35,584
I went to a hypnotist, cost $500.

340
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,758
- How did that go?
- It went pretty good...

341
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,329
until I saw a pair of shoes
that I could've bought.

342
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,296
I started smoking again.

343
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:47,236
But this time I'm quitting for sure.

344
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:48,998
- For sure.
- Yeah.

345
00:20:50,673 --> 00:20:51,765
Me, too.

346
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,375
Wanna share one more?
Let's share one more.

347
00:20:59,482 --> 00:21:00,574
Definitely.

348
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:07,386
What kind of a guy do you go out with?
What do you look for in a man?

349
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,891
Honestly, just a regular, nice guy...

350
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,621
like yourself!

351
00:21:14,197 --> 00:21:18,327
Tell him I don't represent talent.
I represent temperature, and he's not hot.

352
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:19,799
Sarah Silverman. Hi.

353
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:22,632
- Ari Gold, hi.
- Nice to meet you.

354
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:25,500
- We've met before.
- No, I know...

355
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:28,076
They're booking hip people here.
Now, that's cool.

356
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,644
No, I'm not on the show tonight.

357
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:32,340
That's even hipper.
Cool people hanging out.

358
00:21:32,448 --> 00:21:33,779
That's awesome. That's cool.

359
00:21:33,883 --> 00:21:36,647
Right. I'm here representing my boy,
Vinny Chase.

360
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,419
Are you going to the green room?

361
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,981
No, I'm not going in.
I got banned from that fucking place.

362
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,492
- Really?
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

363
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,530
I had a little situation
with Natalie Portman's father.

364
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:49,620
Stupid.

365
00:21:49,732 --> 00:21:53,293
- It was a weird situation.
- I'll sneak you in. Wanna go in with me?

366
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,428
Like we go in together?
You and me together?

367
00:21:55,538 --> 00:21:57,301
Like, we're going in at the same time.

368
00:21:57,407 --> 00:22:01,275
All right, but are we going to be
leaving together is what I'm saying.

369
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:05,370
That's so scum-baggy.
I know you're married.

370
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:08,211
- I take Krav Maga with your wife.
- I know you do.

371
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:11,514
I'm not trying to fuck you, Sarah.
I'm trying to sign you.

372
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:15,521
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

373
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,991
You're a funny girl. I mean, you know...

374
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:20,491
you do the ass jokes and stuff, I enjoy it.

375
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,530
What's the problem? I'll be out in a second.

376
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,862
<i>I'm sorry, I'll have to ask you</i>
<i>not to hold hands.</i>

377
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:27,868
<i>The FCC says</i>
<i>no overt displays of affection. So...</i>

378
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,165
If you could just separate them. Thank you.

379
00:22:31,274 --> 00:22:33,606
We just had sex about five minutes ago.

380
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:36,105
That's another...

381
00:22:36,212 --> 00:22:38,646
<i>- Is that okay?</i>
<i>- No, you could be arrested for that.</i>

382
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,909
<i>- So wrong!</i>
<i>- We're on the lam now.</i>

383
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:45,613
It's wrong. So, let's talk about the movie.
It comes out this weekend, right?

384
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:49,021
- I don't want to talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it?

385
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,286
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.

386
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:53,862
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.

387
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:55,294
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

388
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:00,997
What about me?

389
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:05,502
- And you, of course.
- He's so full of it. It's unbelievable.

390
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:08,736
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?

391
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,369
Forget about the clip.

392
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,311
<i>All right, we'll forget about the clip.</i>

393
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:14,406
<i>Look, the movie's called</i> Head On.

394
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,712
It's a cool movie, see it this weekend.

395
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:19,788
You're guaranteed to love it,
or your money back.

396
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:25,322
- From the studio. Not from me.
- Yeah. Right.

397
00:23:26,195 --> 00:23:29,164
<i>What would you like to talk about then?</i>
<i>I'll let you decide.</i>

398
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:32,666
<i>Well, why don't we talk about my brother?</i>
<i>He's really pissed.</i>

399
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,964
He says you dissed him,
you owe him a phone call.

400
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:37,562
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.

401
00:23:37,673 --> 00:23:39,937
I can't believe
he's not talking about the movie.

402
00:23:40,042 --> 00:23:42,772
- Get ready for some lies.
- He's going to run out of time.

403
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,507
How is he gonna work
Home Video Solutions into this?

404
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,139
Would you shut up and listen?

405
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,740
What did he tell you?

406
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:52,844
He said that when he hit a rough patch,
you kind of bailed on him...

407
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:55,590
and you never called him again.

408
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,389
He did not... He said I bailed on him?

409
00:23:59,495 --> 00:24:02,225
I was like a bounty hunter
trying to get a hold of him.

410
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:05,300
<i>I called his house. I looked for his address.</i>

411
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:07,168
<i>He owes me a call.</i>

412
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:08,936
I think he might be right.

413
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:10,528
He's backstage.

414
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,399
Who? He is?

415
00:24:13,609 --> 00:24:15,975
<i>Is he really? Johnny Drama's backstage?</i>

416
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:18,342
Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.

417
00:24:18,447 --> 00:24:20,506
<i>Is he around? Is he really backstage?</i>

418
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,210
- Come on. Go.
- Go!

419
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:27,251
What's wrong with you? Get out there!

420
00:24:33,229 --> 00:24:34,560
Do I need makeup?

421
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,738
The great Johnny Drama!

422
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:58,578
- Maybe I did owe you a call, buddy.
- That's all right. Johnny Drama, everybody!

423
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,292
Isn't that classic?

424
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,991
- How do I look? I look pretty good?
- You do look thin.

425
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:15,935
- Thin? I look lean.
- That's what I meant.

426
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:17,266
No body fat.

427
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:19,238
<i>You guys are living together now?</i>

428
00:25:19,342 --> 00:25:21,902
<i>It's a bachelor pad?</i>
<i>What's the setup over there?</i>

429
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,775
<i>- Tell them about the home theater.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

430
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,082
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.

431
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,709
- Except...
- Except...

432
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,682
a home theater.

433
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:37,049
But we've been told that Rufus
at Home Video Solutions...

434
00:25:37,393 --> 00:25:39,486
...is the best in the business.

435
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:47,736
<i>Here you go!</i>

436
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:52,336
- To Drama.
- To Drama.

437
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,973
Great night.

438
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,317
Great fucking night.
