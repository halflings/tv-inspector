1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:03,695
One of the funner things
that we do here in Pawnee

2
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,713
is the annual easter egg hunt.

3
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,339
Tom hides the eggs,

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,259
and I have to say,
he did an exceptional job this year.

5
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,927
I've been searching for 25 min,

6
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,179
and I haven't found one.
And I'm an adult.

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,939
Yeah, I forgot to do that.

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:21,755
Maybe Tom's trying to make this year
a challenge. And if so, he's succeeding.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,274
I don't think an egg
has been found yet.

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:27,233
Let's keep looking.
We're gonna find one.

Épisode 101
<i>Canvassing</i>

14
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,182
I'm going to see my mom.

15
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,706
She's a big mucky-muck
in the county school system.

16
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:05,031
She's my hero.

17
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,774
How do I explain her?
She's...

18
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,984
as respected as mother Teresa,

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,634
she's as powerful as Stalin,

20
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,914
and she's as beautiful
as Margaret Thatcher.

21
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,576
- In or out, Leslie. Doorway is creepy.
- Right, sorry.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,940
Choosing in.

23
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,372
So, what do you want, Leslie?

24
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:24,500
Just here to gossip, gab, chat.
Stuff we do.

25
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,002
But it looks like you're super-busy.
And I am super-busy,

26
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,340
so I shall bid you <i>adieu</i>.

27
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,762
That's weird.
I just remembered something.

28
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,202
I have my own subcommittee now.

29
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,474
I'm sure you've heard something.
People are talking.

30
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:44,713
We're having a town hall meeting
tomorrow at 7:00 p.m.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,698
At the Smithfield community center.

32
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:49,188
Yeah, I'm leading it.
It's no biggy.

33
00:01:49,355 --> 00:01:51,026
I mean, it is.
It's a big deal...

34
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:53,332
I don't know, I mean, you know...

35
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:55,489
Wanna come?

36
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:58,450
Honey, jeez, you know how busy am.

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,108
I know. I know.

38
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:02,346
That's why I fake-invited you.

39
00:02:04,668 --> 00:02:05,911
I'll try to be there.

40
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,125
Okay, so everybody's here.

41
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,672
Let's get started.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,669
- Metal. Sorry.
- It was really loud.

43
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,422
Subcommittee members,
are we prepared for tomorrow night?

44
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:18,637
- Have you booked the hall yet?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,693
- Ann, did you clear your schedule?
- I did. I changed my shift.

46
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,603
Leslie, I just have to say

47
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,562
I think you might be taking this
to the public a little bit too soon.

48
00:02:27,008 --> 00:02:29,148
It doesn't matter
what you propose to the public,

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,151
they might call for a vote.
If they vote you down, then you're done.

50
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,695
I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
I have a secret weapon.

51
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,039
Canvassing.

52
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:41,452
Nothing better than good old-fashioned
door-to-door campaigning.

53
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,505
I'm not above using my expertise

54
00:02:43,672 --> 00:02:46,335
to change hearts and minds
if the cause is just.

55
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:51,032
When I was in sixth grade,
I was voted best dressed by 87 votes.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,307
And there were only 63 people
in my class.

57
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,212
Andy fell into that pit.

58
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,886
I fell into that pit.

59
00:02:59,376 --> 00:03:01,764
How many more Pawnee citizens
have to fall into that pit

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,682
before we turn it to park?

61
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,809
Zero.
Say it.

62
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,487
- Zero.
- A hundred.

63
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,627
I've got some sunscreen
for your beaks.

64
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,949
Tom, you probably won't need any.

65
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:16,057
And this is our canvassing guide.

66
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,448
This is gonna be the script that we use
when we speak with people.

67
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:22,735
"If a person is a man,
turn to page two."

68
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,273
"If the person looks like a celebrity...
Example: Jack Nicholson...

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,052
"Use this to help your pitch.

70
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:30,319
"Example: You can't handle the pit.

71
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,628
"That's why we need
to turn it into a park."

72
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,799
This is really thorough.

73
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,321
Ann and I are a team. You too.
We have even sectors.

74
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,804
You have odd sectors.
And we're gonna win.

75
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,527
Win what?

76
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:45,576
Go!

77
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,563
Someone's in there.

78
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,566
- That's gonna be fun. Excited?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,419
- Ready? Are you pumped up?
- Yes.

80
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:56,741
Look humble.

81
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,108
But confident.

82
00:04:00,243 --> 00:04:03,136
Good afternoon. We are representatives
from your local government.

83
00:04:03,303 --> 00:04:05,914
May we speak with you
about the Sullivan street pit?

84
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:06,943
Sure.

85
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:08,921
Excellent.
Positive response.

86
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:14,378
How would you feel if we turned that pit
into a beautiful community park?

87
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,338
Yeah, that would be a great idea.

88
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,439
Good, I live in the neighborhood,

89
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:21,024
so I could probably tell you
a little bit about...

90
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,364
Section three.

91
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:26,779
We are having a public forum
tomorrow night.

92
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:29,476
And that would be great
if you could come

93
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,186
voice your strong support.

94
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,955
Tomorrow? I can't.
I'm busy. Sorry.

95
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:37,137
We understand that people are busy,
but we would love for you to come to...

96
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:39,308
Sorry. Good luck, though.
I'm all for a park.

97
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:42,030
- Would it change if we told you that...
- She's gone.

98
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,510
Yeah, a park.
That sounds like a really good idea.

99
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,700
Great. Would you be willing to come
to a town meeting and show your support?

100
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:48,745
Absolutely.

101
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:52,833
Now, is this park gonna have
a playground or a pool for the kids?

102
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,334
How old are your kids?

103
00:04:55,417 --> 00:04:56,253
No kids.

104
00:04:57,687 --> 00:04:59,612
- I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
- Don't.

105
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:02,574
Also is the park gonna be at least
a thousand feet from my house?

106
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,776
Because, yeah,
I really can't move again.

107
00:05:04,943 --> 00:05:06,430
April, please stand behind me.

108
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:08,690
That's it.
That's all that we got.

109
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,357
- No flier?
- Nope.

110
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,548
Man, this is great.

111
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:22,170
This is so great. I love canvassing.
What a great way to spend my time.

112
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:25,311
All right, team Haverford,
you guys are awesome,

113
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:28,231
but I think I might work better
as a solo artist,

114
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,375
so I'm gonna head out, peace.

115
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,658
- He runs weird.
- He really does.

116
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,317
It's a good idea.

117
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:42,210
But I'm just not sure.

118
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:45,059
Okay, which part
are you not sure about?

119
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,012
Turning the pit into a park.

120
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,566
That's kind of the whole thing.

121
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,795
I think this is a great idea,
but I can't make any forum.

122
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:56,583
- I would have to get a babysitter.
- How old are your kids?

123
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,894
Four and two.

124
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,150
Could the four-year-old
watch the two-year-old?

125
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:01,979
Mickey!

126
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:05,489
What's up, buddy?
How's my number one sod man doing?

127
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,502
Here's the 1, 2, 3 of the situation.

128
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,911
One: we're building a new park.
Two: I'm on the committee.

129
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:12,996
Three: you're putting in the sod.

130
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:16,208
Maybe down the line, situation'll arise
where you could hook me up.

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,252
Are you gonna commit to coming
to this forum or are you  a bitch?

132
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,851
Yes, you do owe me.

133
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,352
Okay, keep going.
Keep moving.

134
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,270
Nose to the grindstone.
No means yes.

135
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:29,094
Can we stop, please?
Because it's really hot and I'm tired.

136
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,347
Yeah, I'm hot too.

137
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,933
Let's blow in each other's faces.

138
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,736
- Or we could drink some water.
- Let's do that.

139
00:06:36,903 --> 00:06:40,560
My house is really close by.
Let's go take a break for an hour or so.

140
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:45,204
Look, I didn't want it to have
to come to this, but, Ann,

141
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,924
please open the sealed envelope
that's in your binder.

142
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,181
This is a little something
I learned from Karl Rove.

143
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:55,806
If you want to guarantee
the results of a survey,

144
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:59,292
you design the question to give you
the answer that you want.

145
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,095
"Wouldn't you rather have a park

146
00:07:01,262 --> 00:07:03,975
"than a storage facility
for nuclear waste?"

147
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,215
That seems iffy.

148
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,135
- Don't worry. I made it all up.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

149
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,388
Wouldn't you agree,
like most decent Americans,

150
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,849
that it would be a good idea to turn

151
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:17,334
the abandoned lot on Sullivan street
into a beautiful community park?

152
00:07:17,754 --> 00:07:18,952
Actually, no.

153
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,637
I'm not really a fan of parks.

154
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,899
Very noisy.
Barbecue smell all the time.

155
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
Would you change your mind
if I told you

156
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,565
that nine out of ten meth users
said the same exact thing?

157
00:07:29,732 --> 00:07:30,571
What?

158
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,173
How would you even know that?

159
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:34,835
Survey.

160
00:07:35,531 --> 00:07:37,118
We surveyed crystal meth users.

161
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:41,271
We're actually having a little
town meeting tomorrow night

162
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:43,677
- if you wanted to...
- I know it sounds weird,

163
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,170
but I just don't like
living near parks.

164
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,237
So do you have a flier or something?
I'd be happy to take it.

165
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,142
You don't care about your kids
if you don't support it.

166
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,495
Excuse me?

167
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,199
It's... what I mean is,
kids love parks

168
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:05,870
- and you should too.
- If I don't support your project,

169
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:07,527
then I don't love my daughter?

170
00:08:07,898 --> 00:08:09,992
- I didn't...
- What time is this thing anyway?

171
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,241
- It's next month. Forget it.
- It's tomorrow night. I'll be there.

172
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,293
Great.

173
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,676
Okay, come on.

174
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:16,843
We got one.

175
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,861
Am I talking to the two sexiest thighs
in landscaping?

176
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:26,945
Yes, I am, 'cause I'm talking to Marcy.
How's it going? Tom Haverford.

177
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:30,926
Kevin, your sandboxes are the best.
That's why I want you involved.

178
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,267
I want the best monkey bars in my park.
I don't mind hooking you up.

179
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:37,307
Maybe down the line, there will be
a situation where you can hook me up.

180
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,569
Thank you for your time, sir.

181
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:42,813
He said some upsetting things.

182
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,320
I can't believe you gave him
your home phone number.

183
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:48,298
Well, I'm a public servant.
I need to be accessible.

184
00:08:48,465 --> 00:08:50,131
What the hell is wrong with people?

185
00:08:50,298 --> 00:08:52,192
I should show them
Andy's medical bills.

186
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,620
- Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.
- Oh, my God.

187
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,256
Ann, game changer.

188
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:58,245
- You busted the game wide open.
- How?

189
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:01,123
We need Andy.
He's our symbol.

190
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,716
We'll wheel him around
the neighborhood to get sympathy.

191
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:05,214
He's a cute FDR.

192
00:09:08,664 --> 00:09:11,730
- Ron, You got minute.
- Sure, Paul. What can I do for you?

193
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,841
Sullivan street park project,
you fast-tracked it, right?

194
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:18,238
Yeah, absolutely.
We have a public forum tomorrow.

195
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:20,146
Okay, great.

196
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:21,954
- I'll be there.
- Great.

197
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,603
"You fast-tracked that, right?"

198
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,193
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,944
Did you say something?

200
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,714
You didn't say anything to me?

201
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,883
There's a new wind blowing
in government, and I don't like it.

202
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:46,560
All of a sudden, there's all
this federal money coming in,

203
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:50,372
and Paul, the city manager,
is telling us to build parks,

204
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:52,408
start new community programs.

205
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:53,674
It's horrifying.

206
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,294
- Do you have like a nurse's costume?
- Costume? Like scrubs?

207
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:58,838
Yeah, put those on.

208
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,220
Bass, come on!

209
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:30,296
- It can be tricky...
- Don't.

210
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,978
Why do I want
to build this park so bad?

211
00:10:33,145 --> 00:10:35,142
Maybe because
a pit filled with garbage

212
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,428
isn't the best we can do in America.

213
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,064
You know, in Russia...
they could pretend that pit was a park.

214
00:10:41,497 --> 00:10:43,397
Bring their kids down there.

215
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,716
"Hey, Vlad!

216
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:47,996
"Look at these rocks.
Let's pretend they're potatoes.

217
00:10:48,163 --> 00:10:49,023
"Nikolai,

218
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,473
"do you want to swim in the dirt?"

219
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:54,065
But not here.

220
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:56,155
'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.

221
00:10:56,628 --> 00:10:58,254
And it is my dream

222
00:10:58,886 --> 00:11:00,286
to build a park...

223
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:05,572
that I one day visit with
my White House staff on my birthday.

224
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,901
And they say, "President Knope...

225
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
"this park is awesome.

226
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:15,772
"Now we understand why you are the first
female president of the United States."

227
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:25,726
Builder of parks.

228
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,997
- How was canvassing?
- Canvassing was... okay.

229
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:33,653
But... I think we're going to have
to postpone the town meeting.

230
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:35,475
Postpone?

231
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,948
Only for 1 to 90 days.

232
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,743
No, you're doing this meeting.
You have my full support.

233
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:45,246
I was talking to the city manager,

234
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,846
exchanging ideas.

235
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,495
There's a mutual
respect there. And...

236
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:52,862
together, we have decided
to fast-track your project.

237
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,445
City manager?

238
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:55,759
Really?

239
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,436
I have to cancel this meeting.
Fast-track?

240
00:11:58,603 --> 00:12:00,262
Did my nane come up at all?

241
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,014
- This meeting needs to be canceled.
- No, it's happening.

242
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:04,579
Look, just...

243
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,852
Just do a good job tomorrow.
We have to push this thing through.

244
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:09,562
Of course.

245
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,105
I'll push anything through anything.
You know me.

246
00:12:12,407 --> 00:12:14,431
- Are you sweating through your suit?
- I doubt it.

247
00:12:14,598 --> 00:12:17,277
It's a very breathable fabr...
Yeah, I am.

248
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,698
Jerry, what's up, man?

249
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,526
You're into pretzels, right?

250
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:25,369
Hit 'em up. Thanks for coming down.
I got a seat for you over there.

251
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,638
My top priority:
getting your fences in there.

252
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,448
I drove your fences the other day.
I was, "that fence looks awesome".

253
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:31,834
"Of course, Roy's."

254
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,295
If you're into chocolate muffins,
grab all you want.

255
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,630
Some people may say that bringing
in these contractors this early

256
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,008
is jumping the gun.

257
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,806
Well, guess what?
Here's the gun. Here's me.

258
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:43,705
Victor Miles,

259
00:12:43,926 --> 00:12:46,640
Tom Haverford. How are you?
Thank you so much for coming down.

260
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,101
I want to introduce you to Leslie.

261
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:54,249
He's a gentleman I met canvassing.
He also happens to be the top sod guy

262
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,485
- in Indiana.
- That's terrific.

263
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,696
I really want you to nail this.

264
00:13:00,995 --> 00:13:03,828
Don from Don's Cement,
Tom Haverford. Good to see you.

265
00:13:03,995 --> 00:13:06,180
Thinking of a jingle
for your company. How's this?

266
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:09,305
<i>Don's Cement,
is the best you can get</i>

267
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:10,414
<i>Don's.</i>

268
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,363
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Andy came too to give support.

269
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,421
- I have a lot of stage experience...
- This will be fine, right?

270
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,257
It's a park, for God's sakes.
How much can they hate a park?

271
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,374
A lot of them seemed
to hate a park yesterday.

272
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,613
April, I need you in the audience.
Wait. And...

273
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,931
If the questions
start getting negative,

274
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,767
I need you to sell the crap out
of the park. Can you do that?

275
00:13:30,153 --> 00:13:31,602
Please, this is serious.

276
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:33,299
Can you do that?

277
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,465
- Probably.
- Good girl.

278
00:13:36,008 --> 00:13:39,408
Good probably. Good girl.
Here we go. Line up, everybody.

279
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,495
My mom's here.

280
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,395
I can't do that.

281
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:52,812
That's illegal.

282
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:56,719
Thank you so much for coming out
tonight. This is our first town meeting

283
00:13:56,886 --> 00:13:58,796
about the proposal to turn

284
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,996
lot 48 on Sullivan Street
into a community park.

285
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,490
This is gonna be a train wreck.

286
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,444
I want my daughter to be successful.
Which is why I always tell her,

287
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,773
"there's nothing wrong
with being a wife and mother".

288
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:17,148
Now, there are many people

289
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,818
that I spoke to who are passionately
in support of this idea.

290
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,820
None of them were able
to make it tonight, unfortunately.

291
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:25,207
But...

292
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,074
they totally exist.

293
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,183
I did not make them up.

294
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,093
I see a question.

295
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,379
- No questions.
- My name is Kate Speevack.

296
00:14:35,546 --> 00:14:37,723
- I remember you.
- And I live in the neighborhood.

297
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,630
And I am 100%

298
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:41,382
against this park.

299
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:44,629
I cannot believe the department
is moving forward with a project

300
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:46,927
without a single
environmental impact study.

301
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:50,315
And if you guys agree with me,
let's take a stand!

302
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,974
We are a little ahead of schedule

303
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:04,069
because we're holding
this town hall meeting so soon.

304
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,322
Which I was warned about

305
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,200
by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner
assigned to this project.

306
00:15:11,306 --> 00:15:12,744
So, what would he say?

307
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,939
Here we are.

308
00:15:19,072 --> 00:15:21,908
Should I give them
some background info on the site?

309
00:15:22,075 --> 00:15:23,125
Absolutely.

310
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,540
Mark Brendanawicz knows
the answer to every question.

311
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,537
He's amazing, and congratulations
for hearing him speak.

312
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:33,214
Hi, there. Leslie might have
oversold me a little bit.

313
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:36,810
Certainly did not. He's the man.
He's capable of anything.

314
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,687
Lot 48 is...

315
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:40,688
It's a rectangular lot.

316
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:44,557
It's got excellent drainage, and it's
on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.

317
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:45,945
Any questions?

318
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,905
I have more of a comment
than a question.

319
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,074
- Go for it.
- It's for the guy in the cast.

320
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,034
Here we go.
Lawrence.

321
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:54,870
That is Andy Dwyer.

322
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,524
He is a local resident,

323
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,707
and he tragicay fell in the pit.

324
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,084
Yeah, I don't care
about any of that.

325
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,289
He's the guy that plays music all night
in his garage. It's driving me nuts.

326
00:16:05,456 --> 00:16:07,056
Lawrence lives with...

327
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:08,704
his grandma.

328
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:11,351
Which is pretty awesome.

329
00:16:11,518 --> 00:16:14,974
He takes care of her, I guess.
But whatever. He's a douche bag.

330
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,060
It's loud. It's abusive.
And it's waking up my birds.

331
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,728
You have birds now?

332
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,800
Yeah, I have birds.
I have nice,

333
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,233
pretty, expensive birds. And you play
that music, and it wakes them up.

334
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,658
Look, I don't work
for the government.

335
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:30,197
I do play rock & roll.
Guilty as charged.

336
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,033
I'm in a band.
It's called Just The Tip.

337
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,537
And, actually, if anyone here
plays bass, we need a bassist.

338
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,262
Let's take a five-minute break,
shall we?

339
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:43,447
It is not...

340
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,388
going well at all.
It's going very poorly.

341
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:50,427
- Like you're crashing and burning.
- Democracy's happening.

342
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:53,386
People are talking. I mean,
at least they aren't apathetic, right?

343
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,180
You're right about that.
They're deeply negative.

344
00:16:56,567 --> 00:17:00,060
You need to put a happy face on this,
give me a few positive talking points.

345
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,510
And whatever you do, avoid a vote.

346
00:17:09,784 --> 00:17:12,184
I'm oddly attracted
to Kate Speevack.

347
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,629
Before we continue, I'd love
to just give you a little history

348
00:17:17,796 --> 00:17:18,787
of Pawnee.

349
00:17:19,504 --> 00:17:22,706
The city of Pawnee
was incorporated in 1817

350
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,542
when a young man by the name
of Reverend Luther Howell

351
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,881
came from Terre Haute on an ox.

352
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:31,477
He planted his flag in the ground

353
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,244
and was met soon after

354
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:36,190
by an angry tribe
of Wamapoke Indians,

355
00:17:36,836 --> 00:17:39,494
who, when seeing
the whiteness of his skin,

356
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,211
twisted him to death.

357
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,854
Flash forward to 1969.

358
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Man walks on the moon.

359
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:48,905
Pawnee is lousy with hippies...

360
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:51,877
My God, she's filibustering
her own meeting.

361
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:53,793
Filibuster.

362
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,185
They can't touch you
if you talk forever.

363
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,181
I can't speak of the future.

364
00:17:59,348 --> 00:18:00,317
But I will.

365
00:18:00,484 --> 00:18:04,284
The future of Pawnee will involve us
flying around in space taxis,

366
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:07,649
where we will communicate
on watches...

367
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:11,548
and blink our feelings to each other

368
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:13,759
rather than use words.

369
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,095
And now I'd like to take

370
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,760
a magical journey through...

371
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,557
a little something I like to call
<i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>

372
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,810
- by Norton Juster.
- Excuse me, can't you read

373
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,812
- that children's book on your own time?
- I have the floor.

374
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:32,294
"There once was a boy named Milo
who didn't know what to do with himself.

375
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:35,750
"Not just sometimes, but always..."
- You know what? This is a public forum,

376
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:38,534
which means that we all get
to tell you what we think.

377
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:41,112
Well, you did already talk, ma'am.

378
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,708
And I would love to listen
to someone else, someone I don't know.

379
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,418
That girl , long brown hair
and yellow top.

380
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:50,205
Could you tell us
how you feel about this park?

381
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:51,888
Go ahead.

382
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:55,936
I'm a youth in the community,

383
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,411
and I think a new park
is a great idea.

384
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,306
And I fully support it,

385
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:03,850
as would the rest of the youth
in the community.

386
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,531
I recognize her.

387
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,356
- That kid came to my door yesterday.
- Oh, my God.

388
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,256
They have planted people
in this audience.

389
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:13,615
Unbelievable.

390
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:17,489
We all agree that this park is
a bad idea. We should just take a vote.

391
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:20,033
We will take a vote.
Before we do that,

392
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,614
I want everyone up,
lined up behind that microphone.

393
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:24,746
I want to hear from all of you,
one-by-one.

394
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,039
That was brutal.

395
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:28,917
A couple weeks ago, I was yelling
at Leslie at a public forum.

396
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,378
God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious
as those people.

397
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,414
I wasn't, right?

398
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,761
At 5:00 in the morning, every morning:
Beep... I don't want to hear that.

399
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,867
How long is this project gonna take?

400
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:43,056
That's what I wanna know,
what's important to me.

401
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:45,801
- Because I need my sleep.
- Thank you, ma'am.

402
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,478
That concludes our meeting.

403
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,938
- What about the vote?
- We're out of time.

404
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
It's 9:00.

405
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:54,710
But we will have many public forums
in the future,

406
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:57,696
and we hope to see you all there.
Thank you so much for coming.

407
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:11,686
It was tough.

408
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,986
But, you know, that's Pawnee.
That's democracy.

409
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:19,259
A lot of people here want this park. You
just gotta get past the negative people.

410
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:20,952
But guess what?

411
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,519
My subcommittee held its first
town hall meeting tonight.

412
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:26,432
God, I loved it.

413
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,641
I loved every minute of it.

414
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:33,032
- Hey, park lady.
- Yeah?

415
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,233
You suck.

416
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:37,816
Hear that?

417
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,137
He called me "park lady".

418
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,627
Normally I don't agree with Leslie
about anything, but this book...

419
00:20:46,834 --> 00:20:47,996
is awesome.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
