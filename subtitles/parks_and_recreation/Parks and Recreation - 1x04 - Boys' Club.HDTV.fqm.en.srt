We live in a fish bowl, and
The public is always watching.

32
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:12,456
That's why i go Two towns over If i

And i never violate it.

42
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,442
People look at me And they say,

Politics is full Of boys'
clubs, Formal and informal.

57
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:40,134
Behind me are all the members Of the
city council Over the past 30 years.

58

And every day, As a woman, I have
to walk past This wall of men.

59
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,280
It can be very upsetting,
Especially because Of that guy.

60
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:50,283
No matter What direction i move,
He's always staring At my chest.

there? wheeling and dealing.

63
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,287

That was the sound Of a
glass ceiling Being shattered.

81
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:58,936
The boys' club is more about Socializing than
work, you know? I mean, you gotta loosen up.

135
00:08:46,145 --> 00:08:48,446

The minimum punishment for this Is an
official reprimand From the city manager.

00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:26,697
it's not that big a deal. maybe
in your world It isn't a big deal.

147
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,159
You're a white protestant man
With a full, rich moustache.

148
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:34,304
But i am a woman, And i need to
hold myself up To a higher standard.

149
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,246
this is ridiculous. Yore punishing yourself
More than anybody else no Is gonna punish you.

150
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,096
What do you suggest we do? You
think we should Cover this up?

151
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,142
no, i'm not saying that.
No one said "cover-up".

152
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:48,119
good because the cover-up
Is worse than the crime.

153
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:53,758
When you spill something And you try to wipe it up
With something that's dirty, Then you get double dirty.

154
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:56,545
please don't Make
this worse. oh, my god.

155
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,161
Good afternoon.

156
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:05,135
Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps
To make further amends For the mistakes that i've made.

157
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,399
I have written A full confession,

158
00:10:07,434 --> 00:10:12,310
Which i will be emailing To everyone
in the entire Pawnee government.

159
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:18,603
I've also attached a link To the pit's web page
Just to remind people Of all the good work that i do.

160
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:22,026
I asked ron to blow The
whistle on me, And he refused.

161
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,535
And that is why I had
to whistle-blow myself.

162
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:32,469
i wish i could say Some of this
mess was ann's, But it's all mine.

163
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:34,629
I'm kind of a nester.

164
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:39,365
Eh, not bad for a guy
With two broken legs.

165
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:48,645
Hey.

166

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,471

171
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:13,852
because i was waiting For my sister and
i was bored, And my hair Looked rllgood.

221
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,322

water first if i may. certainly.

222

Of acceptance Into this elite, Exclusive club- "

225
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:41,642
sorry, What club is this?

226
00:14:41,677 --> 00:14:46,485
a couple city planners Like to drink
beer In the courtyard On tuesday nights.

227
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,345
no one is supposeto drink
Alcohol on government property.

228
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,028
it's not my department.
Go ahead, leslie.

229
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:59,516
"i made A very unwise decision, "a
decision that will live In infamy.

230
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:02,659
"i opened a gift basket
Of wine and cheese.

231

"our intern, april ludgate, "drank
some of that wine Without my knowledge.

232

idea Of boys' clubs Is ancient history. "

236
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:33,967
but you did Open the gift basket.

237
00:15:34,002 --> 00:15:39,011
And the intern Did drink the wine.
Please don't blame her For my mistake.

238
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:48,003
The biggest crime We could commit here Would be to
destroy A teenage girl's passion For local government.

239
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:52,446
there's only one more
thing I need to clean- Me.

240
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:57,219
Um, i can't really Get into a shower,
So i got this idea From my parents.

241
00:15:58,544 --> 00:16:00,387
This is how They clean their dog.

242
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,469
You like that?

243
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,227
I wrote that for ann.

244
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:12,942
It's gonna be playing when she
Walks through the door today.

245
00:16:12,977 --> 00:16:14,896
And check this out.

246
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:18,116
Washed my shorts. How you like that?

247
00:16:20,155 --> 00:16:23,355

248
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,950

nicely. you did not ask me nicely.

251
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:34,850
Put that down!

252
00:16:34,885 --> 00:16:37,880
I just put 12 new
batteries In that thing!

253
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,298
Lawrence, come on.

254
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,419
ugh, ugh. give it to me.

255
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,056
Go back inside, hank.

256
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:55,783
ms. Knope, what was The first thing you
did When you arrived at work The next day?

257
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,985
Can you go over the timeline
For us once more? yes, of course.

258
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,966
I awoke at 6:21 a. m. After a fitful
night of sleep. we've been over this.

259
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:07,214
What more could you guys
Possibly want her to do?

260
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:10,921
well, we don't know yet. Frankly,
we've got A lot more questions.

261
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,343
ron, it's okay. no, it's not.

262
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:15,312
This is not communist china.

263
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:19,046
You cannot Make her whip herself.
You cannot make her Wear a hair shirt.

264
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:22,711
we weren't planning On doing either
of those things. this is america.

265
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:27,233
You wanna live In north korea, You can
live in north korea. I don't want to.

266
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:28,865
I want to live in america.

267
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:34,235
Leslie has never broken A rule in her
life, To the point That it's annoying.

268
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:37,323
If you want to slap her
On the wrist, go ahead.

269
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:40,358
You wanna Do anything more serious,
You're gonnaave To go through me.

270
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,511
Let's go. are we done?

271
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:42,630
we're done. Let's go.

272
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:52,749
So after all that, It's really not that
bad. You're gonna get a letter In your file.

273
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:56,122
ron, i just wanted To say thank
you- don't worry about it.

274
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:07,122
No, i didn't do it For leslie. I
did it because I hate bureaucracy.

275
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:13,428
My idea Of a perfect government Is one
guy who sits In a small room at a desk,

276
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:16,346
And the only thing He's allowed
to decide Is who to nuke.

277
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:24,054
The man is chosen Based on some kind of iq test And
maybe also A physical tournament, Like a decathlon.

278
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:28,622
And women are Brought to him maybe

279
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,040
When he sires them.

280
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,696
oh, hey, ann, You're here.
yeah, i came From the hospital.

281
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:37,259
How'd it go? i don't
wanna Be overdramatic,

282
00:18:37,294 --> 00:18:42,020
But today felt like 100 years in hell And
the absolute worst day Of my life. oh, god.

283
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:44,565
i never shoulda opened
That stupid basket.

284
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,122
yeah, why did you Open that basket?
It doesn't really Seem like you.

285
00:18:48,157 --> 00:18:50,145
i think it's 'cause i wanted
To shatter the glass ceiling,

286
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,811
You know what i mean? And just
kind of infiltrate The boys' club.

287
00:18:56,591 --> 00:18:57,865
i did it for a guy.

288
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,643
oh. yeah.

289
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,608
