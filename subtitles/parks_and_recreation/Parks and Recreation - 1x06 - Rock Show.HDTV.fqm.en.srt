00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,350
There used to be this huge speed Bump in the center of town.

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,460
It we. So i decided i wanted To do something about it.

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,910
And i got it lowered twonches.

58
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,960
Apparently what i can achieve In government Can literally be measured.

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,680
hey,dr. Harris.

60
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680

And we'd love it If you came by.

62
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,140
I think there's gonna be A good turnout At andy's show tonight.

63
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,520
He wrote this new song About what happened to him Calledthe pit.

64
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,570
It's one of those rare songs That rocks really hard...

65
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,120
And also informs people about A small public works project.

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,760
guess andy's doing well.

67
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,260
yeah,he's A little shaky still, But that's to be expected.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,440
well,not really.

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,520
If he had his cast Removed two weeks ago, The Have atrophied so much.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
i'm sorry,two weeks ago?

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
it's when they Were scheduled to come off.

72
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,210

73
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:50,970
no,he rescheduled.

74
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,970
He said it was personal, That he would explain later, But then he never explained.

75
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,370
i have waited on him Hand and foot

76
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,990
For two months.

77
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,650
well,i guess That explains it.

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,040
hey,what's up,people Of pawnee? All right.

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,800

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,630
Please be patient while we Rock out the equipment setup.

82
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,270
The band has had a few Different nameover the years.

83
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,170
When it started we were Teddy bear suicide,

84
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,900
But then we changed it To mouse rat.

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,960
Then we were god hates figs. The department of homeland Obscurity.

86
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,520
Flames for flames. Muscle confusion.

87
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,220
Nothing rhymes with orange.

88
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,140
Uh,then Everything rhymes with orange.

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,130
Punchface champions.Rad wagon.

90
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,800
Puppy pendulum. Possum pendulum. Penis pendulum.

91
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,340
Hand rail suicide. Angel snack. Just the tip. Three skin.

92
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,010
Uh,jet black pope.

93
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,880
We went back to mouse rat. And now we are Scarecrow boat.

94
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,430
God,when i hear myself Say scarecrow boat Out loud,i kind of hate it.

95
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,130
now,you know That we're gonna be building A park in a residential lot,

96
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,150
So of course we're gonna have To get the zoning codes approved And amended by our city council.

97
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,570
what kind of movies Do you like? huh?

98
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,880
Oh,well,you know...

101
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,050
So i brought Some pictures of the lot, And you can tell that The houses are very close to it.

102
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,900
How difficult is Rezoning in your town?

103
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,890
Could you go into detail A little bit about that? sure. great.

104
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,430
it's refreshing To be with someone Who likes talking about Government issues.

105
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,040
most of the women I go out with find it boring.

106
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,840
well,you know, You veo have zoning codes, Or else the whole thing Could be chaos.

107
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,090

108
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,830

113
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,840
Not my kids, 'Cause they're grown up. But...

114
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,110
