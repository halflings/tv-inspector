Well, I didn't want

I've been tracking

( Sighs ) That's a damn shame.

I got some squirrel...
About a dozen or so.

There was a problem in Atlanta.

<i>Shane:
We're not sure.</i>

He either is or he ain't!

381
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,694
No easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.

382
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:36,164
- Who are you?
- Rick Grimes.

383

<i>Rick Grimes, you got something
you want to tell me?</i>

384
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:41,803
Your brother was
a danger to us all,

385
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:44,939
so I handcuffed him on a roof,
hooked him to a piece of metal.

386
00:26:44,974 --> 00:26:47,208
<i>He's still there.</i>

387
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:50,979
Hold on.
Let me process this.

388
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:54,015
You're saying you handcuffed
my brother to a roof

389
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,717
and you left him there?!

390
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,652
Yeah.

391
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:03,625
- ( Grunts )

392
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,461
<i>T-Dog:

393
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:08,296
( Shouts, grunting )

394
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,767
Shane:
Okay. Okay.

395
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:16,104
- You'd best let me go!
- Nah, I think it's better if I don't.

396

Come on, man.
We'll keep this up all day.

399
00:27:23,412 --> 00:27:26,180
I'd like to have a calm
discussion on this topic.

400
00:27:26,215 --> 00:27:28,216
Do you think
we can manage that?

401
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,419
- Do you think we can manage that?
- Shane: Hmm?

402
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:34,489
Mmm. Yeah.

403
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:36,958
( Panting )

404
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:39,527
What I did was not on a whim.

405
00:27:39,562 --> 00:27:43,631
Your brother does not work
and play well with others.

406
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:47,602
It's not Rick's fault.
I had the key.

407
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:50,305
- I dropped it.
- You couldn't pick it up?

408
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:52,774
Well, I dropped it in a drain.

409
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:02,917
If it's supposed to make me
feel better, it don't.

410
00:28:02,952 --> 00:28:04,485
<i>T-Dog:
Well, maybe this will.</i>

411
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,454
Look, I chained
the door to the roof...

412
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:08,189
So the geeks couldn't
get at him...

413
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:11,993
- With a padlock.
- It's gotta count for something.

414
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:19,500
Hell with all y'all!

415
00:28:19,535 --> 00:28:21,836
<i>Just tell me where he is</i>

416
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,871
so's I can go get him.

417
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:26,507
<i>Lori:
He'll show you.</i>

418
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,376
Isn't that right?

419
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,718
I'm going back.

420
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:45,727
( Sighs )

421
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,996
So that's it, huh?

422
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,998
You're just gonna walk off?

423
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,866
Just to hell
with everybody else?

424
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,802
I'm not saying
to hell with anybody...

425
00:28:58,836 --> 00:29:01,137
Not you, Shane;
Lori least of all.

426
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:03,339
<i>Tell her that.</i>

427
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:06,710
She knows.

428
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,412
Well, look, I...

429
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:11,548
I don't, okay, Rick?
So could you just...

430
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,650
Could you throw me
a bone here, man?

431
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,351
<i>Could you just
tell me why?</i>

432
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,687
Why would you risk your life for
a douche bag like Merle Dixon?

433
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,223
- Hey, choose your words more carefully.
- No, I did.

434
00:29:20,257 --> 00:29:23,626
Douche bag's what I meant.
Merle Dixon...

435
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:25,795
The guy wouldn't give you
a glass of water

436
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,231
- if you were dying of thirst. - What he
would or wouldn't do doesn't interest me.

437
00:29:28,265 --> 00:29:30,800
<i>I can't let a man
die of thirst... me.</i>

438
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,103
Thirst and exposure.

439
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:35,705
We left him like
an animal caught in a trap.

440
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,041
That's no way for anything to
die, let alone a human being.

441
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:43,113
So you and Daryl,
that's your big plan?

442
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:48,685
Oh, come on.

443
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,987
You know the way.
You've been there before...

444
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:53,323
In and out, no problem.
You said so yourself.

445
00:29:54,825 --> 00:29:56,659
It's not fair of me to ask...
I know that,

446
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,261
but I'd feel a lot better
with you along.

447
00:29:58,295 --> 00:30:00,230
I know she would too.

448
00:30:00,264 --> 00:30:03,566
That's just great.
Now you're gonna risk three men, huh?

449
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,069
- Four.

450

and better, don't it?

451
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:10,306
<i>T-Dog: You see anybody

452

<i>to save your brother's
cracker ass?</i>

453
00:30:12,276 --> 00:30:15,078
<i>- Why you?
- You wouldn't even begin to understand.</i>

454
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:17,947
- You don't speak my language.
- That's four.

455
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,417
It's not just four. You're putting
every single one of us at risk.

456
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:24,020
Just know that, Rick.
Come on, you saw that walker.

457
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,688
<i>It was here.
It was in camp.</i>

458
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,190
They're moving out
of the cities.

459
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:29,125
They come back, we need
every able body we've got.

460
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,927
<i>We need 'em here.
We need 'em to protect camp.</i>

461
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:32,962
It seems to me what
you really need most here

462
00:30:34,064 --> 00:30:38,334
- are more guns.
- Right, the guns.

463
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,270
- Wait. What guns?
- Six shotguns,

464
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:43,306
two high-powered rifles,
over a dozen handguns.

465
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,875
I cleaned out the cage back
at the station before I left.

466
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:48,611
<i>I dropped the bag in Atlanta
when I got swarmed.</i>

467
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,381
It's just sitting there on the
street, waiting to be picked up.

468

You just got here and you're
gonna turn around and leave?

471
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,361
Dad, I don't want you to go.

472
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,433
<i>To hell with the guns.

473
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,602
Merle Dixon?

474
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:15,972
He's not worth one of your lives,
even with guns thrown in.

475
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,676
Tell me.
Make me understand.

476
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,280
I owe a debt to a man
I met and his little boy.

477
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,816
Lori, if they hadn't
taken me in,

478
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,818
I'd have died.

479
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,588
It's because of them that I
made it back to you at all.

480
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:34,023
They said they'd
follow me to Atlanta.

481
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,526
They'll walk into the same trap
I did if I don't warn him.

482
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,129
What's stopping you?

483
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,032
The walkie-talkie, the one
in the bag I dropped.

484
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,536
He's got the other one.
Our plan was to connect when they got closer.

485
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,539
- These are our walkies?
- Yeah.

486
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:51,541
So use the C.B.
What's wrong with that?

487
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,476
The C.B.'s fine.

488
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,411
It's the walkies
that suck to crap...

489
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,147
Date back to the '70s, don't
match any other bandwidth...

490
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,916
<i>Not even the scanners in our cars.</i>

491
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,520
I need that bag.

492
00:32:17,134 --> 00:32:18,768
Okay?

493
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,508
All right.

494
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,648
Rumor is you have bolt cutters.

495
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,153
<i>- Maybe.
- Yeah, we get to that roof, though,</i>

496
00:32:37,187 --> 00:32:39,956
we'll need to cut that
chain and the handcuffs.

497
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,426
I never like lending tools.

498
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,161
The last time I did...

499
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:47,363
And yes, I am talking
about you...

500
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,732
<i>Let's just say
your bag of guns</i>

501
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,567
wasn't the only bag
that was dropped.

502
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:54,170
My tools got
left behind with Merle.

503
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:56,239
<i>Rick: We'll bring
your tools back too.</i>

504
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:59,542
Think of the bolt cutters
as an investment.

505
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,212
Sounds like more of a gamble.

506
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,989
- What do I get in return?
- What do you want?

507
00:33:13,023 --> 00:33:14,791
How about one of those
guns you bring back?

508
00:33:14,825 --> 00:33:17,193
- My pick.
- Done.

509
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:20,196
<i>( Man clears throat )
Dale, let's...</i>

510
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,298
Sweeten the deal a bit.

511
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:25,101
Now that cube van of yours...

512
00:33:25,135 --> 00:33:27,270
What about it?

513
00:33:27,304 --> 00:33:29,539
The R.V.'s
radiator hose is shot.

514
00:33:29,573 --> 00:33:33,142
<i>That's a problem if we need to get
somewhere and wanna get very far.</i>

515
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,879
And the hose on that van is
just about a perfect match...

516
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,881
Well, enough that
I can make it fit.

517
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,984
I'll tell you what...
We get back,

518
00:33:41,018 --> 00:33:44,587
you can strip that van
down to the bare metal.

520

- Come on, let's go!
- Thank you.

521
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:58,601
Hey, Rick, got any
rounds in the python?

522
00:34:00,137 --> 00:34:01,337
No.

523
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,939
Last time we were
on the gun range,

524
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:06,242
I'm sure I wound up with a
few loose rounds of yours.

525
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,947
You and that bag... like the
bottom of an old lady's purse.

526
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:12,582
I hate that you're
doing this, man.

527
00:34:12,616 --> 00:34:15,151
I think that
it's foolish and reckless.

528
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:17,687
But if you're gonna go,
you're taking bullets.

529
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:21,124
I'm not sure I'd want to
fire a shot in the city,

530
00:34:21,158 --> 00:34:23,726
- not after what happened last time.
- That's up to you.

531
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:26,729
Well...

532
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,667
Four men, four rounds.

533
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,470
What are the odds, huh?

534
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,373
Well, let's just hope that...

535
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,076
Let's just hope four is
your lucky number, okay?

536
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:43,980

00:40:29,314 --> 00:40:31,415
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my son.

629
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:33,450
<i>You don't look at him.
You don't talk to him.</i>

630
00:40:33,484 --> 00:40:36,053
<i>From now on, my family
is off-limits to you.</i>

631
00:40:38,389 --> 00:40:40,390
Lori, I don't think that's fair.

632
00:40:40,425 --> 00:40:43,493
<i>- Shane, shut up. Don't!
- I don't think that...</i>

633
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:47,030
<i>My husband is back.
He is alive.</i>

634
00:40:47,065 --> 00:40:49,833
He's my best friend.

635
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:52,736
Do you think I'm not
happy about that?

636
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,905
<i>How dare you?
Why would you be?</i>

637
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:58,275
<i>You are the one that
told me that he died.</i>

638
00:41:00,144 --> 00:41:02,212
You son of a bitch.

639
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,889
<i>( Shuffling footsteps )</i>

640
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:22,432
( Growling )

641
00:41:29,407 --> 00:41:33,176
Damn. You are
one ugly skank.

642
00:41:36,948 --> 00:41:38,615
( Thuds )

643
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,170
Ed, tell you what...

644
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:02,105
You don't like how
your laundry is done,

645
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,475
you are welcome to pitch in
and do it yourself. Here.

646
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,278
- Oh!
- Ain't my job, missy.

647
00:42:08,312 --> 00:42:10,480
- Andrea, don't.
- What is your job, Ed?

648
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:12,349
<i>Sitting on your ass
smoking cigarettes?</i>

649
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:13,583
Well, it sure as hell
ain't listening

650
00:42:13,618 --> 00:42:15,052
to some uppity
smart-mouthed bitch.

651
00:42:15,086 --> 00:42:18,422
Tell you what...
Come on. Let's go!

652
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:20,624
I don't think she needs
to go anywhere with you, Ed.

653
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,793
And I say it's none of your business.
Come on now.

654
00:42:22,827 --> 00:42:24,828
- You heard me.
- Carol.

655
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,997
Andrea, please.
It doesn't matter.

656
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:29,633
Hey, don't think I won't
knock you on your ass

657
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,468
just 'cause you're some
college-educated cooze,

658
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:33,136
- all right?
- ( Gasps )

659
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:35,806
Now you come on now
or you gonna regret it later.

660
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,141
So she can show up
with fresh bruises later, Ed?

661
00:42:38,176 --> 00:42:40,143
<i>- Yeah, we've seen them.
- ( Laughs )</i>

662
00:42:40,178 --> 00:42:42,379
<i>Stay out of this.
Now come on!</i>

663
00:42:42,413 --> 00:42:44,848
You know what?
This ain't none of y'all's business.

664
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:47,451
You don't want to keep
prodding the bull here, okay?

665
00:42:47,485 --> 00:42:50,020
<i>Now I am done
talking. Come on.</i>

666
00:42:50,054 --> 00:42:52,289
- No no. Carol, you don't have...
- ( Carol mutters )

667
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:54,791
You don't tell me what!
I tell you what!

668
00:42:54,826 --> 00:42:56,960
( Clamoring )

669
00:42:56,994 --> 00:42:59,062
- You think you can...
- Get off her!

670
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:00,897
- Come here! Come here!
- Get off her!

671
00:43:00,932 --> 00:43:03,633
- Get off her! Get off her!
- Get off me!

672
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,902
- ( Ed grunting )
- Carol: Ed?

673
00:43:05,937 --> 00:43:08,038
- Amy: It's okay. It's okay.
- Carol: No!

674
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,674
- It's okay.
- No!

675
00:43:22,186 --> 00:43:24,321
<i>- ( Women yelling )
- Amy: Shane, stop!</i>

676
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:25,789
<i>Just stop!</i>

677
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:29,459
Carol:
Stop it!

678
00:43:29,494 --> 00:43:31,461
<i>- Stop!
- You put your hands on your wife,</i>

679
00:43:31,496 --> 00:43:33,430
your little girl
or anybody else in this camp

680
00:43:33,464 --> 00:43:35,799
one more time, I will not stop next time.
Do you hear me?

681
00:43:35,833 --> 00:43:37,701
- Do you hear me?!
- ( Slurs ) Yes.

682
00:43:37,735 --> 00:43:39,636
- I'll beat you to death, Ed.
- Carol: Ed!

683
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,372
<i>Oh God!
( Crying )</i>

684
00:43:42,406 --> 00:43:43,940
No.

685
00:43:43,975 --> 00:43:46,443
- God!
- ( Grunts )

686
00:43:47,645 --> 00:43:50,547
( Crying ) Ed, I'm sorry.

687
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:54,251
Oh my God.
Ed, I'm sorry.

688
00:43:55,386 --> 00:43:58,421
<i>I'm so sorry, Ed.</i>

689
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:00,991
Ed, I'm sorry.

690
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:03,160
- I'm sorry, Ed.
