ain't even got! - ( Laughs )

And you're bringing even more of them
down on our ass! Man, just chill.

161
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:22,580
Bad enough I've got this
taco-bender on my ass all day.

162
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,549
Now I'm gonna
take orders from you?

163
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,786
I don't think so, bro.
That'll be the day.

164
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,788
"That'll be the day"?
You got something

165
00:12:29,822 --> 00:12:32,157
- you want to tell me?
- Hey, T-Dog man, just leave it.

166
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,692
- No. 
- All right? It ain't worth it.

167
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:36,861
Now Merle, just relax, okay?

- Yeah.

I'll tell you
the day, Mr. "Yo."

is a man looking

Anybody that gets in the way
of that is gonna lose.

There's no refugee center.
That's a pipe dream.

237

Then she's right.
We're on our own.

238
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,068
It's up to us
to find a way out.

239
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:41,603
Good luck with that.

240
00:16:41,637 --> 00:16:44,506
These streets ain't safe in this
part of town from what I hear.

out of these cuffs,

244
00:16:51,848 --> 00:16:55,083
we go off somewhere

Rub muncher.
I figured as much.

247
00:17:03,426 --> 00:17:05,460
The streets ain't safe.

248
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:07,229
Now there's an understatement.

249
00:17:07,263 --> 00:17:10,031
What about under the streets?
The sewers?

250
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,134
Oh man.

251
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:14,236
Hey, Glenn, check the alley.

252
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,904
You see any manhole covers?

00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:20,942
( Growling )

254
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:27,883
No, must be all out on the
street where the geeks are.

255
00:17:27,917 --> 00:17:31,119
Maybe not. Old building like
this built in the '20s...

256
00:17:31,154 --> 00:17:34,055
Big structures often had
drainage tunnels into the sewers

257
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,491
in case of flooding
down in the subbasements.

258
00:17:36,526 --> 00:17:39,261
- Glenn: How do you know that?
- It's my job... was.

259
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:40,996
I worked in
the city zoning office.

260
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,443
This is it?
Are you sure?

261
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:58,380
I really scoped this place out
the other times I was here.

262
00:17:58,414 --> 00:18:00,482
It's the only thing in the
building that goes down.

263
00:18:01,584 --> 00:18:03,118
But I've never gone down it.

264
00:18:03,152 --> 00:18:05,587
Who'd want to, right?

265
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,928
Oh. Great.

266
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,965
- We'll be right behind you.
- No, you won't. Not you.

267
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:19,234
Why not me?
Think I can't?

268
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:21,236
I wasn't...

269
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,871
Speak your mind.

270
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:29,044
Look, until now I always
came here by myself...

271
00:18:29,078 --> 00:18:31,680
In and out, grab a few
things... No problem.

272

<i>The first time I bring a group...
Everything goes to hell.</i>

00:18:34,383 --> 00:18:36,151
No offense.

274
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,822
If you want me to go down
this gnarly hole, fine...

275
00:18:40,856 --> 00:18:44,259
But only if we do it my way.

276
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:47,162
<i>It's tight down there. If I run into
something and have to get out quick,</i>

277
00:18:47,196 --> 00:18:49,397
I don't want you all jammed up
behind me getting me killed.

278
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,002
I'll take one person...
Not you either.

279
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,404
You've got Merle's gun
and I've seen you shoot.

280
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,306
I'd feel better if you
were out in that store

281
00:18:58,341 --> 00:19:00,542
watching those doors,
covering our ass.

282
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:02,877
And you've got the only other
gun, so you should go with him.

283
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:05,981
You be my wingman.
Jacqui stays here.

284
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:08,016
Something happens,
yell down to us,

285

<i>- get us back up here in a hurry.
- Okay.</i>

286

Sorry for the gun in your face.

292
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:25,126
People do things
when they're afraid.

293
00:20:25,161 --> 00:20:27,462
Not that it was
entirely unjustified.

294
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,365
You did get us into this.

295
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:32,534
If I get us out,
would that make up for it?

296
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:35,937
No, but it'd be a start.

297
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,885
Next time though,
take the safety off.

298
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,420
It won't shoot otherwise.

299
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,791
- Oh.
- Is that your gun?

300
00:20:56,826 --> 00:20:58,793
It was a gift. Why?

301
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,300
Little red dot means
it's ready to fire.

302
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:07,669
You may have occasion
to use it.

Good to know.

304
00:21:15,244 --> 00:21:17,612

You're giving me
a headache, boy.

Why don't you pull
your head out of your ass?

312

Maybe your headache
will go away.
