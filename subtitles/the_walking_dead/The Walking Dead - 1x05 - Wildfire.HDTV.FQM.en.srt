I'd have died. The walkie-talkie,
the one in the bag I dropped.

3
00:00:07,013 --> 00:00:08,837
He's got the other one.
I'm going back.

I tell you what!

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,494
My husband is alive.

Do you think I'm
not happy about that?

7
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:17,812
You were the one that
told me that he died.

Atlanta isn't what we thought.

It's not what they promised.
The city is...

24

Do not enter the city.

- He's sick. A sick man.

00:07:34,126 --> 00:07:36,094
We start down that road,
where do we draw the line?

113
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:39,631
The line's pretty clear.
Zero tolerance for walkers,

00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:42,200
- or them to be.
- What if we can get him help?

115
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:44,369
I heard the C.D.C.
was working on a cure.

116
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:47,472
I heard that too. Heard a lot of
things before the world went to hell.

117
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:49,607
What if the C.D.C. is
still up and running?

118
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,709
- Man, that is a stretch right there.
- Why?

119
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:55,647
If there's any government
left, any structure at all,

120
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,815
they'd protect the C.D.C.
at all costs, wouldn't they?

121
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,551
I think it's our best shot.
Shelter, protection...

122
00:08:00,586 --> 00:08:03,621
Okay, Rick, you want those things,
all right? I do too, okay?

123
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:06,958
Now if they exist,
they're at the army base.

124
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,160
- Fort Benning. - That's 100
miles in the opposite direction.

125
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,262
That is right.
But it's away from the hot zone.

126
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,164
Now listen to me.
If that place is operational,

127
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:16,401
it'll be heavily armed.
We'd be safe there.

We've all seen that.</i>

130
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:24,042
The C.D.C. is our best choice
and Jim's only chance.

131
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,580
You go looking for aspirin,

some balls to take care

133
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:33,117
- of this damn problem!
- Hey hey hey!

134
00:08:33,152 --> 00:08:35,053
We don't kill the living.

135
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:41,659
That's funny coming from a man
who just put a gun to my head.

136
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:44,162
We may disagree on some things,

137
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:46,964
not on this.
You put it down.

138
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,433
Go on.

139
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:54,772
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?

140
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:56,874
Somewhere safe.

141
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,985
I came to pay my respects.

142
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:28,539
Did I ever mention

143
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,509
how I lost my wife?

144
00:09:35,247 --> 00:09:37,482
- Cancer, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

145
00:09:38,584 --> 00:09:41,352
I dragged her to every doctor,

146
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,621
every test.

147
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:48,292
And after all the surgeries
and the chemos,

148
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:51,095
she was ready.

149
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,564
She accepted it, you know?

150
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:58,403
But I never could.

151
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:02,206
<i>And I spent

152

<i>I felt so cheated.</i>

154
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,318
Since she passed,

155
00:10:14,353 --> 00:10:18,022
you girls were
the first people...

156
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,793
That I cared anything for.

157
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,147
This is her birthday?

158
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,653
Her birthday was always like...

159
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,589
like a week long affair.

160
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:55,026
But I somehow always missed it.

161
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,128
I was away at college

162
00:10:57,162 --> 00:10:59,864
or too busy for kid's parties.

163
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:03,434
She'd call all excited.

164
00:11:03,469 --> 00:11:07,004
I always said
that I'd make it home

165
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,174
and I really always meant to,

166
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:14,479
but I never made it
past that phone call.

167

I know things
are hard enough for you

Okay.

I'm thinking if

I'm thinking maybe our losses
wouldn't have been so bad.

If we hadn't gone off
and brought those guns back

194

I still think it's a mistake
not burning these bodies.

198

It's what we said

we just follow him along?

- There are no rules.

Well, that's a problem.

206

Not for anything.

Do you?

We got guns now.
We're stronger.

236

And we have fewer people.

237
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,188
That makes us weaker.

You want me to say
I think you were right?

239

I understand that.

240
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,599
All I can say is that neither
one of you is entirely wrong.

It's the best
I can do right now.

- Rick...
- We're at the ragged edge here.

We need relief and we got
a sick man who needs help.

I don't know why

Well, look at their faces.

Look at mine.
We're all terrified.

If one of us suggested,

that we head toward that city,

Look, it may be time for you

I think folks around here can make up their
minds without bringing my marriage into it.

You head to the C.D.C.,

you might be on your own.

310
00:24:16,554 --> 00:24:19,056
You gotta really consider
whether you want

00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,191
to put Lori and Carl
in that kind of spot.

I got to do
what's best for my family.

Best for your family?
What's that?

314
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,400
- Exposing them to all kinds of risks?
- As opposed to what?

Crossing 100 miles
of hostile territory?

316
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:35,873
If we're looking for a lifeline, I
say swim toward the closest ship,

317
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,342
not further out to sea.

318
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,277
Why can't you back me up?

319

It's just...

I don't see it.

321
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,285
If it was your family,
you'd feel differently.

322
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,893

00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:08,700
It's day 194 since
wildfire was declared

487
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:12,103
and 63 days since the disease
abruptly went global.

488
00:37:12,138 --> 00:37:14,939
There's no clinical
progress to report.

489
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:23,248
Item... I finally got the scrubbers in the
east sector shut down to save power.

490
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,683
Wish I could have
done it a month ago,

491
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:26,217
but it took me that long
to figure it out.

492
00:37:26,252 --> 00:37:27,819
Too bad I never studied
engineering.

493
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:29,387
Could have saved a lot of amps.

494
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:32,557
Item... I'm still
not sleeping well.

495
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:35,393
Can't seem to keep
regular hours.

496
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:37,729
Living underground
doesn't help,

497
00:37:37,763 --> 00:37:39,931
not knowing
if it's day or night.

498
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:44,536
I'm just feeling very
off-kilter these days.

499
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:49,941
( Beeping )

500

<i>- ( Beeps )
- ( Door hisses )</i>

501
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:54,746

503
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,405
<i>( Alarm sounding )</i>

504
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,509
<i>Computer voice:
Alert status.</i>

505
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,345
<i>Air qualifiers indicate
corrosive fumes.</i>

506
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,747
<i>All personnel
must clear the room.</i>

507
00:39:02,782 --> 00:39:06,284
<i>Corrosive element is deemed
poisonous if inhaled.</i>

508
00:39:22,501 --> 00:39:24,502
<i>All personnel clear.</i>

509
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,538
<i>Full decontamination
in effect.</i>

510
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,540
No!

511
00:39:38,284 --> 00:39:41,019
<i>Full decontamination
complete.</i>

512
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,794
The TS19 samples are gone.

513
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,031
<i>The tragedy of their loss
cannot be overstat.</i>

514
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,936
They were our freshest
samples by far.

515
00:39:59,472 --> 00:40:02,207
None of the other samples
we gathered even came close.

516
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,844
Those are necrotic,

517
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,813
useless dead flesh.

518
00:40:13,853 --> 00:40:16,254
I don't even know
why I'm talking to you.

519
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:21,326
I bet there isn't
a single son of a bitch

520
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,595
out there still listening,
is there?

521
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,434
Is there?

522
00:40:32,338 --> 00:40:34,138
Fine.

523
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:36,774
Saves me the embarrassment.

524
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,550
I think tomorrow I'm gonna
blow my brains out.

525
00:40:48,287 --> 00:40:50,154
I haven't decided.

526
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,726
But tonight,

527
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,995
I'm getting drunk.

528
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:00,999
( Pouring drink )

529
00:41:05,571 --> 00:41:07,505
Speaking of which,

530
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,974
how far do you think
I can chuck this, huh?

531
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,044
Pretty far I bet.

532
00:41:17,983 --> 00:41:19,617
<i>- ( Glass shatters )
- Oh!</i>

533
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:21,786
It is out of the stadium!

534
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,962
<i>( Flies buzzing )</i>

535

( Shane whispering ) All right, everybody.
Keep moving. Go on.

538
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,060
Stay quiet.
Let's go.

539
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:22,880
- ( Chattering )
- Okay, keep moving. Stay together.

540
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,717
- Keep moving. Come on.
- Shh.

541
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:30,722
- Lori: Carol.
- Shh.

542
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,457
Oh, God.

No.

Keep it together.
Come on.

546
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,753
Lori:
We're almost there, baby.

547
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,221
<i>Almost there.</i>

548
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,426
- ( Rattles )
- Nothing?

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,931
<i>( Pounds on door )</i>

550
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,034
T-Dog:
There's nobody here.

551
00:43:16,068 --> 00:43:18,302
Then why are
these shutters down?

552
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:19,871
<i>- Daryl: Walkers!
- Lori: Baby, come on.</i>

<i>- ( Guns cock )
- ( Child whimpering )</i>

554
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,411
You led us into a graveyard!

555
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:28,680
- He made a call.
- It was the wrong damn call!

556
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:31,282
Just shut up. You hear?
Shut up. Shut up!

557
00:43:31,316 --> 00:43:33,384
- Rick, this is a dead end.
- Where are we gonna go?

558
00:43:33,419 --> 00:43:35,486
Do you hear me?
No blame.

559
00:43:35,521 --> 00:43:37,555
She's right. We can't be here,
this close to the city after dark.

560
00:43:40,025 --> 00:43:41,893
Fort Benning, Rick...
Still an option.

561
00:43:41,927 --> 00:43:44,796
On what? No food, no fuel.
That's 100 miles.

562
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,531
125.
I checked the map.

563

<i>Forget Fort Benning.
We need answers tonight, now.</i>

- Well, think of something.
- Come on, let's go.

565
00:43:50,936 --> 00:43:54,138
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go. Please.

566
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,774
<i>Shane: All right,
everybody back to the cars.</i>

567
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,143
- Let's go. Move.
- The camera... it moved.

568
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:02,814
- You imagined it.
- It moved.

569
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,616
- It moved.
- Rick, it is dead, man.

570
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:08,920
It's an automated device.
It's gears, okay?

571
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,521
They're just winding down.
Now come on.

572
00:44:10,556 --> 00:44:13,024
<i>- No, just go away.
- Shane: Man, just listen to me.</i>

573
00:44:13,058 --> 00:44:15,126
Look around this place.
It's dead, okay?

574
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,695
It's dead.
You need to let it go, Rick.

575
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,564
Rick, there's nobody here!

576
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:22,600
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

<i>- Everybody get back to the cars now!
