1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,396
What do you want?
I don't want to argue with you.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,790
Hi.
- Are you?

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,795
You're drunk and very silly.
- Katrine, I think he's ugly.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,396
She's asking you to leave.
- Take it easy!

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,519
We can't meet privately anymore.
It won't do.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,636
Do you know that your wife loves you?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,715
I love her, too.
But I'm not sure about the PM.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,513
No more friends at the Castle.
You must be able to fire anybody.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,148
Do you have a minute?
- Of course.

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,791
Once we would both have protested.
Before you became pragmatic.

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,358
I'm PM. Also for those who
didn't vote for me. Remember that.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,993
"Trust is good, control is better. "
- Lenin

13
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,428
No, in that sense I don't have access
to the Prime Minister.

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,990
Well, we were sort of friends
in those days.

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,277
Yes...

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,639
I think I can bring that up
with Birgitte Nyborg.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,395
Oh yes, we do have
our brief meetings.

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,757
What the hell is this?

19
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,953
Did you put this one in?

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,315
I'll call you back. Bye.

21
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,837
What is it?

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,072
It looks like a camera?

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,837
Magnus, stop that!

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,318
Birgitte, this is against the rules.
Your office hours are at 12, right?

25
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,314
Phillip, I can easily read a report
and plant some flowers.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,395
No, you can't.
We'll do this together, okay?

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,951
Okay... Give it to me!
- Stop it!

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,793
We're doing this together.
- Birgitte!

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,671
Kasper, what do you want?
- I have a minor problem.

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,912
Social Solidarity claim
that we're bugging them.

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,318
But we aren't, are we?
- There are indications that we are.

32
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,912
GOVERNMENT Episode 7
- See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil

33
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,079
Lindenkrone, today you found
bugging devices in your rooms.

34
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,554
I'm shocked. This is
a breach of all democratic rules.

35
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,598
Do you suspect who put it up?

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,833
It wouldn't be the first time that
Intelligence go beyond their limits.

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,834
They are controlled by Parliament.
- The control doesn't work.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,357
The control group is tied
to secrecy in most cases.

39
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,399
Hi, Birgitte. I thought you were
working from home today.

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,112
So did I, but somebody has
been bugging a legal party.

41
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,319
Which equipment did they find?
- That's what I ask myself.

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,396
So you don't know?
- I've asked Intelligence to report.

43
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,997
If it's Intelligence, the bugging
has been past your desk.

44
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,429
I can't remember them all.
There's more than 3,000 every year.

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,550
You can't remember if Intelligence
has asked to bug Social Solidarity?

46
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,352
Nobody is monitored without a reason,
and a judge would be included.

47
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,275
Intelligence follow strict rules.
- So it could be Intelligence?

48
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,991
I'm not 100% certain,
and I don't want to misinform you.

49
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,232
But I'll keep you informed.
- Good.

50
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,358
They already call it 'NørrebroGate'.

51
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,751
Relax...
I am not a crook.

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,275
Okay?
- Okay.

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,473
Bugged them?
But that's bloody illegal!

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,438
Jesus!

55
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,910
One moment.
Yes?

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,791
I'll call the Ministry of Justice.
How did they find out?

57
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,709
Okay.

58
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,310
Right.

59
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,953
Yes.

60
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,513
Let's talk at the editorial meeting.
I'll see you in a moment. Bye...

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,633
That's really good work!

62
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,033
Laura, why don't you help us?
- May I go to Emma's place?

63
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,510
No, we're working together here.
Come on.

64
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,635
Hi, Phillip.
- Hi, Freja. What are you doing here?

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,079
The application that we talked
about. Would you read it for me?

66
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,312
Well...
I really expected it in a mail.

67
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,075
I thought I'd just come by.

68
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,518
What job was it for?
- An internship at the National Bank.

69
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,478
I really want it!
- You want it?

70
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,155
You told us to write
a decent application.

71
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,949
You read so many bad ones
when you were a CEO.

72
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,112
If you mail me later -

73
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,991
I could come back,
so we could look at it together.

74
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,116
Right.

75
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,832
No, I'll just return it
with my comments.

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,310
Okay. Thanks a lot.
- No problem. Bye...

77
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,550
Bye...

78
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,477
Better late than never.
- My bike had a flat tire.

79
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,758
Is he good?
- What are you talking about?

80
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,354
He looks good.

81
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,239
That's a private matter.

82
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,556
We'll see him at the TV-festival.
You're shortlisted for a prize.

83
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,269
You're evading the question.
- Who will you bring?

84
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,671
We could go together.
- I'd love to.

85
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,070
I'm smelling blood here.

86
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,836
The bugging of Social Solidarity
sweeps the table.

87
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,912
I think that a minister
will have to go.

88
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,710
Meaning the Minister of Justice.
- Right. If Intelligence is behind.

89
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,997
Höxenhaven will join me
at 6 o'clock.

90
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,757
He only wants to say that
they're looking into the matter.

91
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,435
He will know if it's Intelligence.
- He won't comment on that.

92
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,151
They say he sleeps with them.
- Who wouldn't if they know his wife?

93
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,359
Somebody else could tell us whether
this equipment is Intelligence stuff.

94
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,550
We're on to an expert.
- Can we get hold of him today?

95
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,157
We could ask him,
if we can tape an interview.

96
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,233
I'd like to use it at 6.
- First you tell the Minister.

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,039
I don't think so.

98
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,354
We don't use methods like that.
- We're talking illegal bugging.

99
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,796
Well, we'll inform him...

100
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,315
...but not this time.

101
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,869
Fine.

102
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,192
Of course I take exception to the
bugging of legal political parties.

103
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,557
I've asked for an investigation.

104
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,272
Could Intelligence possibly
be the bugging agency here?

105
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,672
The present address
for Social Solidarity -

106
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,719
used to be the address for
'Reaktion', the publishing house.

107
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,989
And they sympathized with
many revolutionary movements.

108
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,075
Hence the interest of Intelligence?
- I can't comment on that.

109
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,597
He's under pressure now.
Move closer, but slowly.

110
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,992
So Intelligence isn't behind this?
- There are other possibilities.

111
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:52,191
We've talked to an expert in
bugging equipment. Listen to this.

112
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,512
It's one of the world's
smallest surveillance cameras.

113
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:03,438
A Hapac-Fischer U-46 CCD-camera,
transmitting on 2.5 gigahertz.

114
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,233
The mike is very sensitive. It will
pick up the slightest whispering.

115
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,188
If it's not Intelligence, it would be
people they should keep an eye on.

116
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,352
It's state-of-the-art equipment.

117
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,195
Who would be the owner here,
in your opinion?

118
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,510
I'm 90% certain it's Intelligence.

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,195
90% certain of Intelligence,
an expert says.

120
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,990
I can't comment on that.
- What the hell can you say?

121
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,950
Intelligence is your province.
- I don't know their expert.

122
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,958
His name is Hansen, and he's
considered to be a leading expert.

123
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,672
We won't get any closer than this.
- Thank you.

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,150
And now some good housing news...

125
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,834
Bloody good interview!
- Thanks.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,232
Remember to thank you mom and your
boyfriend in your speech of thanks.

127
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,516
Ulrik will receive the prize.

128
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,549
Will we see little Benjamin
in a tight tux?

129
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,838
I don't think so, Tanja.
- He's only good enough for sex?

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,518
You were the one to suggest sex!
- You've been together for 2 months.

131
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,195
Everybody seems to have an opinion
about my private life.

132
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,069
What's so dangerous
about being seen together?

133
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,310
Bye...

134
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,832
Höxenhaven has been called in by
the legal affairs committee tomorrow.

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,232
I've asked for a report.
- You should stay out of this.

136
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,234
The media mustn't think they can
approach the PM on this issue.

137
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,278
Agreed.
It's a Minister of Justice issue.

138
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,037
Social Solidarity have called
all day. Don't open a dialogue.

139
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,273
I've agreed to meet Lindenkrone
in a moment.

140
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,432
Can she approach the PM
just like that?

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,628
They have a right to be furious.
I'm accommodating them.

142
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,271
Because Lindenkrone
was your invention?

143
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,470
No, Bent.
- Who is whose invention?

144
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,791
Birgitte got her into politics.
- Wrong.

145
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,748
I met her at a radio debate.

146
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,151
She was good, and
I encouraged her to enter politics.

147
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,632
You were her mentor, really...
- No, I was not, Bent.

148
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,669
I always thought our party could
agree with them on a few issues.

149
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,310
Bent never liked Lindenkrone.
As a principle.

150
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,313
Oh, come on... No, no.

151
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,268
He's a bit uneasy about
the red-haired company.

152
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,797
Would you discuss that over a beer
at the next party convention?

153
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:57,398
Right. The majority of the government
rests on Social Solidarity.

154
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,950
So a dialogue-friendly approach...
- Precisely.

155
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,989
What can we offer her?
- Offer her? What do you mean?

156
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,199
So she will not topple the
government, if it comes to that.

157
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,599
Hi, Birgitte.
- Hi, Anne Sophie.

158
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,196
Thanks for taking the time.
- Of course.

159
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,238
How are you?
- You ought to know.

160
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,710
Aren't you bugging us right now?

161
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,510
That must be a misunderstanding.
- Misunderstanding?

162
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,070
Didn't TV1 News establish
that they were your people?

163
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,913
My people?
This isn't a police state.

164
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,029
How is bugging a legal party
different from a police state?

165
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,232
In that you're here, you get
an explanation and an apology.

166
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,675
But that's not enough.

167
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,039
It's not that I don't like you
or your project.

168
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,671
No, and that's why I've contemplated
how to accommodate you.

169
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,434
And how would you do that?

170
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,513
Intelligence is Höxenhaven's area.
If a mistake has happened -

171
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,597
he will be rebuked. And
you will receive a formal apology.

172
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,749
And we'll establish a hearing about
the existing control of Intelligence.

173
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,992
Headed by
a former Intelligence chief?

174
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,550
No.
You tell me who you want.

175
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,158
That's a very generous offer,
Birgitte.

176
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,709
It is.
In return I hope -

177
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,989
that you're aware of your position
as the basis for the government.

178
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,039
I don't want to make life hard
for your government.

179
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,399
As long as you can accept that our
voters want a watchdog in Parliament.

180
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,915
What do you mean?

181
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,949
If it really is a misunderstanding,
no problem. If it goes deeper -

182
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,795
I will neither leave you
nor your government in peace.

183
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,997
Just to make our position
quite clear.

184
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,996
But of course.

185
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,273
Let's pretend you don't need this.
- What a boring game.

186
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,108
What's this?
- A galla performance invitation.

187
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,118
"We are pleased to invite you and
companion to a galla performance. "

188
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,751
Who's your companion?
- Nobody. I'm going on my own.

189
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,230
Because it's work.

190
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,155
Don't you want people to see us?
- Stop it. I see you all the time.

191
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,199
We never see anybody.
We have sex, and that's it.

192
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,393
Yes, but I'm very private,
when I'm private.

193
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,953
Let me ask you then: Would you
like me to be your companion?

194
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,795
Maybe.

195
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,269
Maybe?

196
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,557
Yes.

197
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,316
Yes, of course I would.
- Really?

198
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,989
Yes.

199
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,794
Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetheart.

200
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,954
Good morning. Isn't this nice?
- Yes, it's wonderful, right?

201
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,514
I slept like a log.
- Your minister didn't look good.

202
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,549
What's he up to? Letting
Intelligence bug competing parties.

203
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,919
Where I work it would be illegal.
- And in my business as well.

204
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,516
That's not what happened.
- Are you sure?

205
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:19,155
It says here we've got 250.000
surveillance cameras in Denmark.

206
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,950
Do you getter better grades, if you
put a photo on your assignment?

207
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,954
Yes, that's a straight A.
It's a job application.

208
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,159
Her hair is longer now.

209
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,518
She came here yesterday. She wants
an internship at the National Bank.

210
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,714
Maybe I should ask Intelligence
to tail you.

211
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,513
Well, you're already abusing
your power, so why not?

212
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,235
Ready for the consultation?

213
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,359
It belongs to Intelligence
and was installed by Hesselboe.

214
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,592
For which reason?

215
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,389
The rooms were used by people
on the EU terror list.

216
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,836
And you have names?
- Photos and info.

217
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,757
One is Massoud Bucak from
PKK's extremist wing. Also PFLP.

218
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,072
The publishers had lent them
the rooms, right?

219
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,038
Intelligence had
a very complicated task.

220
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,194
Social Solidarity took over
the rooms concurrently.

221
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,639
I have details, but the committee
will get the full report.

222
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,396
It's hardly a desirable situation,
if their criticism is justifiable.

223
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,553
There's nothing at the consultation
that I cannot explain.

224
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,077
This is really taking a long time!

225
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,869
Why don't you get us a sandwich,
Ruben?

226
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,078
Did you deliver what
the opposition had demanded?

227
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,596
Did the committee get the answers
they had asked for?

228
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,595
No. The Minister explained why
the equipment had been set up.

229
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,950
But he hasn't asked Intelligence
to remove it, when we moved in.

230
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,510
Shortly after Nyborg
came into office?

231
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,114
That's why
it's his responsibility.

232
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,909
Maybe the Minister didn't know
you had moved in?

233
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:35,668
The Minister had been informed
that we took over the lease.

234
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,916
When we moved in, we invited
all parties to our housewarming.

235
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,189
Any comments to the consultation?

236
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,639
It's a scandal, if the Minister knew
that a party was under surveillance.

237
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,475
The oppositionen is underway.
- You were PM at the time.

238
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,712
At the time the rooms were taken
by a publishing house.

239
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,429
Our government would
have removed it immediately.

240
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,070
I wonder.
- You want something to eat?

241
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,839
If it had happened in my time,
they would ask for my resignation.

242
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,916
How do you intend to react?
- We've asked for a consultation.

243
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,518
This consultation was a closed one,
but this must be made public.

244
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,356
The Minister must answer
to Parliament and to the nation.

245
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,752
I may call in the PM.
- This is enough!

246
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,916
Sanne! I need Höxenhaven now!
And no excuses, please!

247
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,232
The PM does not defend herself
during intense questioning!

248
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,916
That's bad media exposure.
- You don't have to tell me.

249
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,756
The Minister is in a meeting.
- I said: No excuses!

250
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,152
They're holding a press meeting
in a second. At 4 o'clock.

251
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,954
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

252
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,752
Welcome to you all.
Before we start, I'd like to say -

253
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,234
that there may be questions
we cannot answer -

254
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,551
due to the protection
of Intelligence work.

255
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,508
What do you think of the criticism
of the Ministry of Justice?

256
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:29,390
I don't understand it.
I've explained -

257
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,678
that 'Reaktion' used their rooms
for suspicious meetings.

258
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,436
Social Solidarity claim that
you were aware of their moving in.

259
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,278
The publishers used the rooms after
Social Solidarity's housewarming.

260
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,399
They may have been drinking wine
in the front rooms -

261
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,792
but other things went on in the
back rooms. I want to point out -

262
00:23:53,960 --> 00:24:00,752
that Social Solidarity was never
a target for surveillance.

263
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:06,472
Is there an investigation against
a member of Social Solidarity?

264
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,997
I cannot comment on
ongoing investigations.

265
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,232
Is there an investigation
of any party members?

266
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,073
No comment.

267
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,109
You can't hold a press meeting
that hasn't been cleared by me.

268
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,475
I can explain everything.

269
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,156
Did you approve the bugging after
Social Solidarity took the rooms?

270
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,834
Listen...
- Yes or no?

271
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,232
I have information that justifies
the surveillance -

272
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,756
and which will change
everybody's idea of the matter.

273
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,118
In my office there is a secret
recording of Lindenkrone -

274
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,753
where she argues for kidnapping
former PM Hesselboe's two teenagers.

275
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,151
Anne Sophie?
- Yes.

276
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,632
When was the tapping done?
- About six years ago.

277
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:25,432
It can't be from those rooms then.
- It's from the old Youth House.

278
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,149
There's a lot of noise,
because there was a party.

279
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,996
But there is no doubt that
she considers the possibility.

280
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,436
I suggest we inform the media
already by tonight.

281
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,676
Are you out of your mind?
Do you want to press charges -

282
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,834
because of a bad wiretapping
from a party in the Youth House?

283
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,275
A recording that Intelligence
didn't take seriously?

284
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,275
It's Lindenkrone without any doubt.
- That's not a rescue plan, Höx.

285
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,399
You can hear it yourself.
- I don't want to hear it.

286
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,519
I forbid you to use it.
- You can't do that.

287
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:14,312
It's a very important argument.
What else am I supposed to do?

288
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,189
I don't know.
But you'll have to find out.

289
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:24,230
You are the minister responsible,
and tomorrow you'll explain yourself.

290
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,553
The Minister must explain whether
he was aware that a legal party...

291
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,474
Anne Sophie, may I have a word?
- Yes... We'll talk later.

292
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,632
Thanks.
- Bye.

293
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,353
I didn't know anything about this.
I'm shocked at the whole thing.

294
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,355
Höxenhaven will answer all
relevant questions tomorrow.

295
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,992
What will you gain by grounding him?
Even though he acted foolishly?

296
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,199
We're talking about
illegal surveillance.

297
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:22,954
Anne Sophie, it will be a major
defeat, if Höxenhaven resigns.

298
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,229
Never mind your party members, but
could you hold back a bit tomorrow.

299
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,871
For your sake?
- You could say that.

300
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,398
You have no political interest in
letting down my government. Right?

301
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,270
So tomorrow we belittle
a breach of the Constitution -

302
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,477
for old friendship's sake?

303
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,515
Good. Okay.

304
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,117
Keep me out of it
for as long as possible, okay?

305
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,556
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Kasper.
Bye.

306
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,474
Tell me something
that will make me forget my job.

307
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,916
I've had a visitor.

308
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,271
Hi.

309
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,639
I've gone through Freja's application
with her.

310
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,991
You're doing a great job as PM.
- Thank you.

311
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,197
Okay. I'll be off then.
- Okay.

312
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,795
Thanks for your help, Phillip.
It was really kind of you.

313
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,473
No, keep them.
- Okay.

314
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,390
See you later... Bye.
- Right. Bye.

315
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,188
Where are the kids?
- Laura sleeps over at Ida's.

316
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,319
Karsten asked Magnus to join
William for a circus performance.

317
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,439
They'll be here in a moment.
Are you hungry?

318
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,239
Hi, Mom.

319
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,312
Hi. So you went
to a circus performance?

320
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,677
Hi, Karsten.
Long time, no see.

321
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,990
Magnus, take care.
- Bye...

322
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,631
No, honey. It's too late for cakes.
Was it a good performance?

323
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,870
Look, what I had.

324
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,953
Are we having supper now?
- Yes.

325
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,759
She forgot this.

326
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,072
Spaghetti with meat sauce. That's
what we can offer today. Okay?

327
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,790
The PM's press conference.
- She won't say anything.

328
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,432
Could we make her come here?
- She's kept away from here so far.

329
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,913
Katrine has a special connection
to the PM's spin doctor.

330
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,915
And now to my private life again.
- Because it's so bloody secret.

331
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,756
He will come for the awards.
- The PM's spin doctor?

332
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,038
What is it that I don't know?
- My boyfriend.

333
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,192
Can we move on?
- See you later.

334
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,592
The Minister of Justice will face
the heat in Parliament today.

335
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,469
The opposition threatens
to call the PM as well.

336
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,438
Any comments from the PM?

337
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,673
The case belongs 100%
to the Ministry of Justice.

338
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,517
Do you think the opposition agrees?
- I certainly hope so.

339
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,797
And if it doesn't?
- That's hypothetical.

340
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,589
The Speaker decides
who can be called.

341
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,992
I think she knows
it serves no purpose to call me.

342
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,871
Lindenkrone won't reject
the possibility of calling in the PM.

343
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,079
I trust that the Minister
can answer for himself today.

344
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,075
If the Minister has overstepped
his powers -

345
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,391
will he stay
in the government then?

346
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,714
Not if he has failed
to recognize his responsibilities.

347
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:14,635
Höxenhaven knows that as well
as the other ministers. Thank you.

348
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,509
Can you guarantee he's out,
if he cannot answer for himself?

349
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,639
Thanks to Hanne Holm. That
was the end of our weekly meeting.

350
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,228
Katrine Fønsmark from TV1 News.
I have an appointment with Juul.

351
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,916
Why are you staring at me?
- Because you're cute.

352
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,437
What?
- What?

353
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,679
Hi.
- Well, well...

354
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,310
Distinguished visitors.
To what do I owe the honour?

355
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,598
I'd like an appointment with your
minister. Can we talk in private?

356
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,312
I thought that was over.
- Let's talk about the options.

357
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,032
There's nothing to talk about.
It's not the PM's responsibility.

358
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,112
You took a meeting with me
just to say that?

359
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,717
You asked for it. I looked into it,
and I'm sorry. End of story.

360
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,314
Thanks a lot.

361
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,958
Wait... Katrine!
- You're a waste of time.

362
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,716
Is it because of Benjamin?
- You think I'm that primitive?

363
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,078
Exactly.
- Well, the Smurf beats me at it.

364
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,994
Good conversations about politics?
He's so shrewd, isn't he?

365
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,152
I bet his analyses
are razor sharp.

366
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,074
Life is more than work.
- Not for you.

367
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,554
I thought we had a guard here.

368
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,876
Did the Minister know that
Intelligence tapped a legal party?

369
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,670
Doesn't Mrs. Lindenkrone know that
Denmark is targeted by terrorists -

370
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,798
and that Intelligence fights
on the invisible front?

371
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,557
So the Minister confirms that
Intelligence went too far?

372
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,032
No, but I'm familiar with
Mrs. Lindenkrone's sympathies.

373
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,274
He didn't say that!
- Would the Minister explain that?

374
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,912
There has been every reason
to tap those rooms.

375
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,791
An effective Intelligence is
our only guarantee -

376
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,191
against international terror.

377
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,672
Kasper, let's make overtures
on TV1 tomorrow.

378
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,837
I just turned TV1 down.
- Höx just got himself killed.

379
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,117
This could end in
a vote of no confidence.

380
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,910
We can't expect Höxenhaven
to draw the necessary conclusion.

381
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,878
Well, then somebody
must do it for him.

382
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:15,870
I'm ready to take responsibility
and react accordingly.

383
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,956
I'll apologize tomorrow and accept
a reprimand from you.

384
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,750
As a minister you couldn't answer
questions in Parliament.

385
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,835
You've exceeded your powers
in a crucial area.

386
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,470
We are beyond reprimands.
- Well...

387
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,350
Your morals must be more impeccable
than those of other people.

388
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,991
I see no other options
than asking for your resignation.

389
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,153
I beg your pardon?
Resign?

390
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,279
I can't do that. I haven't even
been minister for a year.

391
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,830
That would look strange.
There's another solution.

392
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,630
There are no other solutions.
- Yes. The Intelligence chief.

393
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,598
If Kruse resigns...
- No. Stop it!

394
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,435
Stop, before you make
an even bigger fool of yourself.

395
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,195
Go home and talk with your family.

396
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,753
And tomorrow you hand in
your resignation in a dignified way.

397
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,150
Right?

398
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,277
Birgitte, this is intolerable.

399
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,514
I'll do anything.
- It's no good, Troels.

400
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,990
It doesn't have to be
your last ministry.

401
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,029
If you resign, you can make
a come-back in a Cabinet reshuffle.

402
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,668
You are a good politician.

403
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,639
But if you don't want to resign,
I have to fire you.

404
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,669
You'll get a vote of no confidence
after your show in Parliament today.

405
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,750
Good. Okay.

406
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,957
Right.

407
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,675
Kruse, we have a situation.

408
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,630
Yes.
I have to ask for your help.

409
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,109
Where are you right now?

410
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,516
My apologies.

411
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,233
This mustn't be a problem for us,
and it will be -

412
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,598
when I can't get an interview,
because you dislike my boyfriend.

413
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,719
Boyfriend?
So it's official now?

414
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,678
Yes.

415
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,993
You've got your interview.
Okay?

416
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,958
The PM will be available tomorrow.

417
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,429
Thanks.

418
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,798
And no more talking about it now.
We're pros, right?

419
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,239
I just need to get used to the idea -

420
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,474
of you choosing a guy like...
Benjamin.

421
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,519
I'm sure he's marvellous.

422
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,759
But it was confirmed.
The PM will be on tomorrow.

423
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,075
Yes,
it pays off to have connections.

424
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,038
Right, Torben.
Bye.

425
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,749
God, that was sweet of you.
I'm starving.

426
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,435
I've been toiling away today.
- Me, too.

427
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,991
I've taken over Tina's advanced class
and will teach director's school!

428
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,280
Great. We'll have champagne,
if we topple Höxenhaven.

429
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,910
Who's he?
- Minister of Justice. You know him.

430
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,674
Not really.

431
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,591
Don't you know
who's Minister of Justice?

432
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,877
Why is that so important?

433
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,749
Because he's the most talked-about
minister at the moment.

434
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,948
I'm not really into politics.
Relax!

435
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,949
But you have to keep track
of what's going on!

436
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,274
I'm busy. I don't ask you
to keep up on amino acids.

437
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,557
We're talking of people
who run this country.

438
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,349
Why is your world
more important than mine?

439
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,188
It isn't.
- But that's what you say.

440
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,911
Yes, it is! Because we tell people
what's going on in the world.

441
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,674
And you talk about spinning bikes!

442
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:25,152
Is that how you see it?
- No, that's how it is, dammit!

443
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,992
Are you checking my mails?
- No.

444
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,039
Are you having an affair with Freja?
- Oh, come on!

445
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,830
She visits you twice in a week
and leaves all kinds of stuff.

446
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,755
She calls you 'sweet' in her mails.
- Are you jealous? She's 22.

447
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,709
I'm asking you.
- No. You're checking me.

448
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,750
No, I'm not fucking one of my
students. I miss adult companionship.

449
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,595
I'm with people her age all day.

450
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,833
That's not where I would go.
- Where would you go?

451
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,959
I can't be bothered to talk like this.

452
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,910
Loyalty is paramount to me.
- Loyalty? Okay.

453
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,551
You're only here when you sleep.
We're not counting on you anymore.

454
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,349
We all work our butts off,
so you can be Prime Minister.

455
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,877
The two of us are sacrificing
our love and sex life on this account.

456
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,634
Not to speak of my career.

457
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,191
We had a deal, Phillip.
It's no use crying over it now.

458
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,434
I'm not crying. We need you
to participate beyond a hobby level.

459
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,479
Would you like an update?
Laura got an A for her essay.

460
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,794
She deserved a small present.
I lied and said that you bought it.

461
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,396
I never asked you to cover for me.
I know what I'm missing.

462
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,676
Oh, shut up.

463
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,116
We both want for anything.
That's the price.

464
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,874
Yes.
- It is!

465
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,955
You have time to be with the kids.
That's something I miss.

466
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,989
Okay. Will you talk to the school
psychologist about Magnus?

467
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,914
About how we keep an 8-year-old
from wetting his pants.

468
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,438
Maybe he should wear a diaper?
- What are you talking about?

469
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,593
Did we wake you up, honey?

470
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,511
You're getting cold.
I'll tuck you in. Come...

471
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,710
Let's move that one up...

472
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,193
Pia, Höxenhaven is on his way out.
- What? Fired, or what?

473
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:24,115
It's only a question of time.
- I'm in a meeting.

474
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,239
Let me go and dig something up.
- You'd better be quick!

475
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,632
Can't you check it out?
- Who? I'll be right there.

476
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,873
Frederik Ravn, isn't he the weirdo
who monitors both right and left?

477
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,398
He's in the lobby with a package,
we'd love to see.

478
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,357
Sorry.

479
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,355
Easy now... Anne Sophie,
what are you suggesting?

480
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,594
I've said it before. Somebody could
grab Hesselboe's own children.

481
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,355
- Shut up! Lindenkrone is right.
- How?

482
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:06,595
Kidnap them. So he'll know what
it feels like to lose your children.

483
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:11,788
I know which school they attend.
Wejust have to plan it carefully.

484
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,430
And it stops here?
- Is that all?

485
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,876
It's Lindenkrone.
- How old is it?

486
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,079
It says 2005 on the tape.
- What do we do? It's spin, you know.

487
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:29,554
Leaked by the Ministry of Justice.
- But this is ass-kicking news!

488
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,874
Based on some old recordings from
a dubious source used by Intelligence.

489
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,716
The Minister is desperate.
Why else would we get this?

490
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,873
It'll divert the flak from Höxenhaven.
- It's a better story.

491
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:49,672
It will justify his bugging
Social Solidarity.

492
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,709
We can run both stories.
- But what will be the top story?

493
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,839
What do you think? We have
the story about the Minister.

494
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,757
He talks about terror attacks, and
he forgets dates, but it's complicated.

495
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:10,995
Then we have a party leader,
who wants to kidnap the PM's kids.

496
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,836
She's not planning it! Why does the
tape stop right here, do you think?

497
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,152
She's drunk, leaves to puke
and goes home.

498
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,950
Listen! A party leader
contemplates a kidnapping.

499
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,795
Do you really mean
that we shouldn't bring it?

500
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,112
Now you define our focus,
which will make Höx a hero.

501
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,955
Höx and Intelligence have tried
to protect democracy.

502
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,796
You can protect it so much
that it's no longer a democracy.

503
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,875
Save that for School of Journalism.
Here we make cool television!

504
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,999
And we're on in 81/2 minutes,
so let's move on.

505
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,793
Ulrik, get on with it.
- Fine... Good luck.

506
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,914
Is Magnus about to get up?
- Yes.

507
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:09,392
Has anybody seen the other
black shoe. Where could it be?

508
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,677
I'll take it.
Birgitte's mobile, Laura speaking.

509
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,356
Mom, it's Kasper.
- Tell him I'll call back from the car.

510
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,275
Sorry, Kasper. She's looking
for one of her shoes... Okay.

511
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,913
Eat your breakfast.
- What channel? Kasper told me to.

512
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,390
The case took a turning
when it became known -

513
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:38,395
- that Lindenkrone
some years ago contemplated -

514
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,109
- abducting former PM
Hesselboe's children.

515
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,717
Hesselboe had decided
that Denmark should invade Irak.

516
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,874
Another 10 seconds.
- Let's take Hesseboe's own children.

517
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,430
- How would you do that?
- Kidnap them.

518
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,798
So he'll know what it feels like
when you lose your children.

519
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,715
I know which school they attend.
Wejust have to plan it carefully.

520
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,111
The Minister of Justice
had this comment:

521
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,909
Lindenkrone's statement
is shocking.

522
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:16,471
A year ago some young activists
entered Christiansborg -

523
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,111
- as Lindekrone's guests and threw
eggs at the Minister for Integration.

524
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,068
It was suggested that an ongoing
Intelligence investigation -

525
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,598
- was relevant to the issue
of bugging Social Solidarity.

526
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,719
I can't comment on that.
- Damn! He did it!

527
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,035
It's shocking that she encourages
such a despicable action.

528
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,636
No matter when she did it.
They are my children!

529
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,794
Do you view the bugging of Social
Solidarity in a new light now?

530
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,478
As Mrs. Lindenkrone inhabits
the rooms, it may be reasonable.

531
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,633
Do you still advocate a kidnapping
of Hesselboe's children?

532
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,396
This was six years ago.
I was young and naive. It was a party.

533
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,870
But you encourage a serious crime?

534
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,555
Who wants to make this public?

535
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,395
The Minister and Intelligence
have leaked this information.

536
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,350
So they are responsible
for your statement?

537
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,399
I haven't got the time now.
I'm expected at a group meeting.

538
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,355
You contacted the New Conservatives,
The Liberals and The Freedom Party.

539
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,355
Yes, they won't support
Lindenkrone at all.

540
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,795
And they let Höx off the hook.

541
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,988
I don't care what he's doing.
I want to see him now! Thank you.

542
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,076
He knows he's about to be fired,
and yet he leaks a recording -

543
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,313
that I prohibited him from using.
I offered to let him resign.

544
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,234
He will be fired so badly that he'll
never become a minister again.

545
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,633
We have to call a press meeting,
so I can explain why he's fired.

546
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:26,874
Birgitte, you can't fire him.
- I can't fire him?

547
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,798
Höx managed to spin the story.
The media bought the connection.

548
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,354
Höx and Intelligence are now heroes
that protect our Danish democracy.

549
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,910
The oppositionen is satisfied
with a reprimand to Höx -

550
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,755
and a report about the bugging
of Social Solidarity.

551
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,630
We have to make use of the fact
that we just passed the buck.

552
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,190
The only tactical solution is
to keep Höxenhaven.

553
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:05,119
He ignored a straight order.
How can I ever trust him again?

554
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,034
Don't trust him then!
But don't fire him.

555
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:15,914
And he completely shattered
Lindenkrone's political life.

556
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,516
Remember what I said about
having friends in the Castle?

557
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,391
This is a political decision.
It's the only right thing to do.

558
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,149
The right thing, Bent?

559
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,516
Thanks.

560
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,509
Yes?

561
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:56,630
Anne Sophie Lindenkrone
wishes to see the PM.

562
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,519
Tell her I'm in a meeting.

563
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,750
For how long?

564
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,756
Very long.

565
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,231
I'd really like to talk to you.
- Sorry, I don't have the time now.

566
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,235
You know what the media are doing to
me? I'm being attacked by everybody.

567
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,996
They're unraveling everything.
- And what can I do?

568
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,950
I said it at a party. You know
I'd never do a thing like that.

569
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,477
I don't control the media.
- You could distance yourself from it.

570
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,553
You could say that it's
a trivial matter in your opinion.

571
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,071
For my sake.
- You said what you said.

572
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,198
You have to accept that.

573
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:37,389
Birgitte, I have no idea
how this tape was released.

574
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,157
There are a few things you need
to know and to take very seriously.

575
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,431
Officially you're still a minister,
but in my mind you were fired at 9.

576
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,078
You have broken every rule
in the book, and you let me down.

577
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,075
Never show up in my office
for no reason, and listen to this:

578
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,950
I consider you a dead man
in my government.

579
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:29,311
The Minister has guaranteed
that this will never happen again.

580
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,153
The committee will get the details -

581
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,713
and the Minister will answer further
questions in a new consultation.

582
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,158
There's nothing more to do
for me in this case.

583
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,788
So Höxenhaven keeps his post?

584
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,794
The Minister of Justice has
my full confidence.

585
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,159
Will Lindenkrone be prosecuted?
- I really don't think so.

586
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:58,518
She will continue as party leader
for the time being.

587
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:05,074
You have a close friendship with
Lindenkrone. Does this affect you?

588
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,872
If you get personally affected in cases
with friends in the Castle -

589
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,828
you couldn't be Prime Minister.

590
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,472
