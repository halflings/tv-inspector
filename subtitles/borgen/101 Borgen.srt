1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,838
"A prince should have
no other aim or thought -

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,629
- but war and its organization
and discipline. " - Machiavelli

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,235
Hanne Holm, political observer,
what kind of game are they playing -

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,518
- The Liberals' Lars Hesselboe
and Labour's Michael Laugesen?

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,434
- Election day is only 3 days away.
- It's a chess game.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,229
The end game is all about
making things simple.

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,075
Getting a few key messages across
and making your opponent look stupid.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,515
Yes.

9
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,956
No, we don't want to talk EU.
That's not sexy election material.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,272
Will Denmark's next prime minister be
Laugesen or Hesselboe?

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,638
It looks like it could be
the Opposition leader, Laugesen.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,157
He's had the initiative
throughout the election.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,551
Hesselboe tries
to preserve things as they are -

14
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:05,238
- but Danes are hungry for change,
albeit they're unsure as to what kind.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,598
Laugesen looks more like
an advertising guy than a politician.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,710
- Collect autographs, do you?
- My daughter does. She loves them.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,000
- Get Birgitte Nyborg's for her then.
- She's more into real celebrities.

18
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,311
- Film and rock stars...
- Are we good to go?

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,155
You're on in eight. They'll ask
why you support Laugesen -

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,518
- and you can tell them how cool
we in the Opposition are.

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,958
Conceal any signs of her
lack of sleep this past fortnight.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,350
She looks fantastic.

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,396
HESSELBOE BEHIND

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,555
Christ, Lars.

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,116
- You're still on these?
- It's the election.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,670
I'm surprised you have a heart.

27
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,434
Hi. Let's do it out here.
In front of Parliament.

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,751
Ask me about asylum seekers only,
got it?

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,629
As always in Danish politics,
the fight is over the center.

30
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,395
The coalition with the centrist
Moderates benefits the Opposition.

31
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,839
Our next guest is Moderate leader,
Birgitte Nyborg Christensen. Welcome.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,434
Kasper.

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,317
Oh, it's just business as usual.

34
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,517
We need to break the old patterns...

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,717
Zoom out on Katrine, 3.

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,793
- Where's Parliament?
- On 4.

37
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,272
- 4?
- 4, yes. Yes, get her shoulder, 3.

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,753
- Is that a live feed?
- Yes.

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,390
- Cue it up.
- We're running out of time.

40
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,632
So drop a few features. Cue it up.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,713
Katrine, have Nyborg comment on
this interview just in with Laugesen.

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,271
At 11 she has a debate meeting
with some Labour hillbilly.

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,831
Overby, right.
She's gonna wipe the floor with him.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,472
Do you share your coalition partner's
vision for the future of Denmark?

45
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,757
Yes, it's the very foundation
of our coalition.

46
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,038
I'd like your comments on this fresh
interview with Michael Laugesen.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,273
Many Danes are worried about
the rising number of asylum seekers -

48
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,955
- in the wake of the Iraq war.
Let me make one thing clear:

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,112
Most of them will be sent back home -

50
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,034
- and until then
they'll be confined in refugee camps.

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
But you said they could work...

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,310
Look, we don't want them
taking Danish jobs.

53
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:39,352
We can't have employment hampered
by refugees already burdening us.

54
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,230
- So, will they be allowed to work?
- No, they won't be allowed to work.

55
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,154
Birgitte Nyborg, isn't Laugesen
going back on a deal here?

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,350
- It might be taken out of context.
- No, he's replying to a question.

57
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,750
Katrine, pile on the pressure.

58
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,710
The issue here is immigration policy,
a key issue to you and the Moderates.

59
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,668
If Laugesen goes back on his word, do
you still prefer him as prime minister?

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,877
Yes, of course we do.

61
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:15,479
- I need to find out if Laugesen...
- Dodge! Change the subject.

62
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,791
- Dodge!
- Laugesen is going back on his word.

63
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,396
Do you still support Laugesen,
yes or no?

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,039
Yes.

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,596
No. If that's Labour's new policy,
Laugesen no longer has our support.

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,955
Thank you, Birgitte Nyborg.

67
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,998
They're changing their policy
this late!

68
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,675
The train scandal continues...

69
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,150
GOVERNMENT
Episode 1

70
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,191
You own welfare and tax reform.

71
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,237
Jesus Christ!

72
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,279
It was in the news one minute ago.
Birgitte Nyborg rejects Laugesen.

73
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,675
- They won't let me buy anything.
- Honey, it's not...

74
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,913
Help me. My card keeps bouncing,
and I'm not leaving without that bag.

75
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,834
- I'm talking to my husband, damn it!
- Where are you?

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,198
Mulberry near Burlington Arcade.

77
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,557
It's all because you always desert me.

78
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,590
- You bastard!
- Honey, get a cab back to the hotel.

79
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,629
- I'm not leaving without that bag.
- Calm down, honey.

80
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,635
I deserve to have it good,
do you hear?

81
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,113
- I'll try to get a plane later.
- See you back home.

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,959
I'll handle this on my own.

83
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,875
- What's up, honey?
- Fucking store. I want this stuff.

84
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,749
- Let's come back later.
- No!

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,313
- You've bought for 12,000 dollars.
- And? I take so much crap from you.

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,870
How about giving something back?

87
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,470
- Lisbeth, please...
- Why can't you be nice to me?

88
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,474
- I forgot my wallet.
- Oh, shut up.

89
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,756
- Call that good journalism?
- Yes.

90
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,232
Birgitte Nyborg's spin doctor is
gonna have your ass.

91
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,076
- It comes with the job, Ulrik.
- Sure it does. Good luck.

92
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,996
You broke our deal. We demanded
to know your questions and angle.

93
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,597
- Ever heard of the free press?
- You know how this shit works.

94
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,072
- We're in the news business, Kasper.
- So, when can I see you?

95
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,708
- Soon.
- You never call.

96
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,872
Are you seeing someone?

97
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,112
- Is Birgitte Nyborg angry?
- No, she's a pro.

98
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,990
You don't pounce on your interviewee
three days before the election.

99
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,950
- Go for your prizes some other time.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

100
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,908
We're here to cover the election,
not to support you.

101
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,552
Changing our policy three days before
the election calls for a new strategy.

102
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,477
I have that debate meeting in
20 minutes. We'll meet this afternoon.

103
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,474
- Is the car waiting?
- Yes. I'll talk to their head of news.

104
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,519
Katrine Fønsmark won't interview you
ever again.

105
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,315
Torben, Kasper Juhl speaking.

106
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,871
- Why can't we meet at the office?
- Something happened in London.

107
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,476
- Yes, you forgot this.
- I'm talking about Lisbeth.

108
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,349
- Popping pills again?
- She bought for 12,000 dollars.

109
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,911
Her Visa card bounced, and I was
afraid someone might see her.

110
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,279
She was about to make a scene,
so I panicked.

111
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,833
I only had my official Eurocard.
I know it was stupid.

112
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,834
Maybe you never should have brought
Lisbeth along to London.

113
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,151
I'll take these
and settle it with the Ministry.

114
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,596
You made a Party purchase
and didn't bring the right card.

115
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,548
It won't be charged to your account
for another two weeks.

116
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,109
We're sticking to the plan.

117
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,035
The Moderates will come crawling,
after Nyborg rejected the Opposition.

118
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,158
- She's rejected us so far.
- She needs new friends.

119
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,599
Besides, we owe her one. She just
gave you four more years, Lars.

120
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,912
See you.
I'm staying in town tonight to work.

121
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,671
How bold of you to change your policy
three days before the election.

122
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,479
I thought Nyborg was a smart girl.

123
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,110
How about a serious talk
when we've got a handle on things?

124
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,158
Why would we want to talk to you?

125
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,359
You need an alternative to the
Freedom Party to ensure your majority.

126
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,988
We need to talk immigrants and taxes.

127
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,393
We need 90 seats, and right now
you look like shit in the polls.

128
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,351
Round up your party for a charm
offensive this weekend. Call me.

129
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,273
And have fun.

130
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,072
- You should have dodged the bullet.
- Like we always do in this party?

131
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,789
- Like professional politicians do.
- See you.

132
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,191
- The Party is gonna have your ass.
- Nope.

133
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,150
I just talked to Nørgaard, Gjervig
and Lindholm. They're all behind you.

134
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,474
- This was bound to happen anyway.
- Laugesen isn't our natural choice.

135
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,191
Natural? We're not picking members
for the softball team here.

136
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,751
We're running for office here.
Did you see the latest polls?

137
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,072
- There's more to politics than polls.
- Not three days before an election.

138
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,471
We listen to the polls,
but they don't dictate our policy.

139
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,792
I know the Liberals want to talk to us.

140
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,919
I think we can keep the Freedom Party
out of power.

141
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,950
You scold her for leaving Labour. Now
you want her in bed with the Right?

142
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,478
- I have a birthday party to go to.
- Are you taking this seriously?

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,152
I work 16 hours a day,
or haven't you noticed?

144
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,279
I'm not going to make ouvertures
to the Right until after the election.

145
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,797
That is the Moderate Party's policy
as decided by me, their leader.

146
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,829
It's Saturday. I promised my children
the next four hours three weeks ago.

147
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,040
Never let your children down, Kasper,
because they grow up to be voters.

148
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,876
Hi.

149
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,994
- I missed you today.
- Boy, you look fantastic.

150
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,233
It's fake. I'm still in makeup
from this morning's show.

151
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,910
It was great! Just think, a politician
changed her policy on live TV.

152
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,437
- It was crazy.
- This is for you.

153
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,675
- Thanks. What is it?
- They said it's 150 years old.

154
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,392
- I bought it in London this morning.
- I thought you were too busy for that.

155
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,954
We were, till the Prime Minister's wife
popped a handful of tranquilizers.

156
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,635
- I thought we didn't talk about that.
- We don't.

157
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,714
If we do, I have a lot of questions.

158
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,190
I want to be with you all the time.

159
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,511
But...

160
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,630
- But?
- I'm lying to Nina and the kids.

161
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:31,392
- I have to make a choice.
- So does everyone in three days.

162
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,992
- I've made my choice.
- Was that a farewell gift?

163
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,359
No. I'm going to leave Nina.
I want to be with you.

164
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,914
All the time. Officially. No bullshit.
Get it?

165
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,238
- Is that ice skating thing tomorrow?
- Yes. Dad's taking me, right?

166
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,631
- Yes.
- I'm going to practice my piano.

167
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,157
Put on your headphones,
so you won't wake Magnus.

168
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,428
Hasn't she been playing
"Let it Be" for two months now?

169
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,070
How's it coming along?

170
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,519
I don't see an international career
in the cards for her.

171
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,231
Honey, you really buy
too much dessert.

172
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,313
And pastry for breakfast. I know it's
for the kids, but I end up eating it.

173
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,711
You always gain weight
during an election.

174
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,156
Hey, you!
Did I ask for honesty here?

175
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,871
"Voluptuous Birgitte Nyborg
in an elegant black dress. "

176
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,589
- They wrote that after that premier.
- So?

177
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,117
Black slims.
Black is sophisticated and sexy.

178
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,432
- Voluptuous in black is bad.
- Look, honey.

179
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,469
You get the most fantastic ass
during an election -

180
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,236
- and I try to live with that
in my own slightly primitive way.

181
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,517
Keep going.

182
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,435
I can't. You've cut off
the blood supply to my legs.

183
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,999
You used to be so funny.
You're losing your touch.

184
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,233
Michael Laugesen wants me to drink
champagne with Labour tomorrow.

185
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,713
When I was young, champagne
and Labour ruled each other out.

186
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,513
- Should I go?
- How tactical do you want to be?

187
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,518
I'm trying to salvage the remains,
but I don't want it to look that way.

188
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,357
Go. Make him retreat. Tell your voters
you'd rather topple the government -

189
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,593
- than sacrifice the Opposition
over a key issue.

190
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,232
- That's gonna take some swallowing.
- Wash it down with some ice cream.

191
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,355
- But you are funny.
- A scream.

192
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,194
Kasper, my usually smart ex,
asked me if I was seeing someone.

193
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,358
I just ignored the question.
I'm turning into a fantastic liar.

194
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,435
My mom doesn't even know you exist.
She will soon, though.

195
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,118
"Meet my new boyfriend, Mom.
13 years older, married with kids. "

196
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,316
I've never been happier.
I just thought you should know.

197
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,474
Meanie! If you're asleep, you're not
getting any sex the next month.

198
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,350
Ole.

199
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,837
Ole... look at me.

200
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,156
Ole, say something!

201
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,199
Come on, damn it!
It's not funny, okay?

202
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,832
Svend Åge Saltum, the Freedom Party
applauds Laugesen's remarks.

203
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,111
It's no secret that Labour needs to get
back in touch with their voters -

204
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,589
- many of whom are switching to us.

205
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,878
- Taking notes, Kasper?
- Good evening, Svend Åge.

206
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,555
No, your rhetoric is
crystal clear as always.

207
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,792
What is it you do, Kasper?

208
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,033
My constituency wants me
to hire a guy like you.

209
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,356
But I don't quite know what you do
to earn your no doubt grand salary.

210
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,150
What do they call you again?
Spin doctor, huh?

211
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,471
- Yes.
- But who's sick, Kasper?

212
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,469
Oh, excuse me.

213
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,873
- Kasper Juhl.
- Kasper...

214
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,113
What did people like you do
before they invented the cell phone?

215
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:48,034
- Katrine, what's up?
- I think he's dead.

216
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,671
- Take a breath. What's up?
- I don't know what to do.

217
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,071
He's just lying there
with his eyes open.

218
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,199
- I've tried everything.
- Where are you?

219
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,750
Tell me where you are,
and I'll be right over.

220
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,319
20 Bredgade, please.

221
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,352
He just went and died.
I guess he must have been sick.

222
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,958
So the guy you kept a secret from me
was the Prime Minister's PR advisor?

223
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,875
How long have you been dating him?

224
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,191
Grab your stuff.

225
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,557
Katrine, grab your stuff.

226
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,678
- You'll get fired, if this comes out.
- I don't care.

227
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,709
- You'll be accused of pillow talk.
- We never told each other anything.

228
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,273
Okay. The cab's waiting outside.
Go home and leave this to me.

229
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,069
- His wife and kids mustn't find out.
- Lots of people mustn't find out.

230
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,758
- We can't just leave him here.
- Katrine, let me handle this.

231
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,280
Go and take the cab.
I'll call you later.

232
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,712
You were home all night watching TV.
You weren't here, okay?

233
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,111
You were never here.

234
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,556
Hurry! Get going.

235
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,273
Emergency, how can I help you?
Hello.

236
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,198
Turn it down!

237
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,551
Hello! Hello!

238
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,755
Turn it down!

239
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,589
Turn it down!

240
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,115
- Do I look okay?
- Your scarf's crooked.

241
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,717
Thanks. People are in shock here.

242
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,591
The Liberal Party Secretary agreed
to an interview later about Ole Dahl.

243
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,311
- I think we should let Katrine do it.
- I can't reach Katrine.

244
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,553
- The broad's gone off the radar.
- But that's unheard of.

245
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,759
- I just texted her those exact words.
- Hi, Hanne. Ulrik speaking.

246
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,391
I don't mean to criticize, but Katrine
isn't the most stable person around.

247
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:48,395
- Let me do the interview.
- First of all, did we ask you? No.

248
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,678
Secondly, if you don't mean
to criticize, what was that then?

249
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,389
- You're not doing the interview...
- Fuck you.

250
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:00,519
Katrine has a different approach.
And I don't mean to criticize, Ulrik.

251
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,549
- Was that really necessary, Hanne?
- He can't get his head out of my ass.

252
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,874
- He's a great reporter.
- No, he's available. That's different.

253
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,396
He's a mediocre reporter, devoid of...

254
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,634
- Turn her off. I can't stand her.
- Here comes the Prime Minister.

255
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,834
Good day to you all.

256
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,639
I have a sad announcement.

257
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,954
My close associate and friend
of 11 years, Ole Dahl -

258
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,033
- died last night of a heart attack.

259
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,873
The election is coming up in two days.

260
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,874
I request of you not to use
this tragedy to question -

261
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,113
- my own and the Liberal Party's
capacity to carry on our campaign.

262
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,034
You'd be questioning
the professionalism -

263
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,760
- we should remember Ole Dahl for.

264
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,993
- Have you got a minute?
- Sure.

265
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,435
What will happen after the election,
do you think?

266
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,797
I'm finished as party leader,
don't you think?

267
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,393
What if I had some information
that could get you into office?

268
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,437
That sounds strange, but intriguing.

269
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,833
The Prime Minister uses state funds to
finance his private overconsumption.

270
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,151
- Who started that rumour?
- I've seen the evidence.

271
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,393
I've seen a Mulberry receipt
for 12,056 dollars -

272
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:40,634
- charged to his official account,
and two annulled Visa Card receipts -

273
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,315
- proving his wife tried
to make the same purchase.

274
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,109
Where did you see them?
Have you got them?

275
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,748
I can get them.

276
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,313
Either we tell Hesselboe we have them
and ask if he's ready to negotiate -

277
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,234
- or we go to the media and join
in the unified Opposition's outcry.

278
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,313
We're no longer part
of the unified Opposition.

279
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,189
Or we leak it anonymously
and wait for him to resign.

280
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,670
- And he will.
- Maybe it's all a misunderstanding.

281
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,674
Hesselboe billed the state
for an extravagant bag and coat.

282
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,832
- His wife is unhappy.
- He committed fraud.

283
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,151
And you want me to blackmail him?

284
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,154
The Prime Minister just lost
his best advisor.

285
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,359
- How dirty do you think I am?
- We stand to take a beating.

286
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,196
This is war. We can't let a chance
like this slip through our fingers.

287
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,956
I'd never forgive myself,
if I came to power that way.

288
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,073
In that case
I doubt you ever will.

289
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,270
Lindenkrone. Who says left-wingers
can't be drop dead gorgeous?

290
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,797
Dunno. But that's not your problem,
because you're not a left-winger.

291
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,795
You're fast. Aicha, good to see you.
You'll find cold sodas in the bar.

292
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,715
- Help yourself. It's free.
- Great, thanks.

293
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,509
Hi there, and welcome.

294
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,390
Birgitte, my dear. Boy, have you been
on my mind these past 24 hours.

295
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,758
- You too, Michael.
- Sounds like the start of a romance.

296
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,957
- Got a minute?
- You bet.

297
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,749
Help yourself to drinks.
It's on the house.

298
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,390
Off to battle
the red flag in hand

299
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,599
in these times
full of turmoil and strife

300
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,436
Close the door. Jesus, the songs
are the worst part of this job.

301
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,116
The old party dinosaurs
are putting the pressure on me.

302
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,558
These suburban bigots are ready to
sell their votes to the Freedom Party.

303
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,589
But I can't let them do that, because
then I won't become prime minister.

304
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,389
You and the coalition have got
to give me some space.

305
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,757
I can't when you go back on our deal.

306
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,277
We agreed to allow asylum seekers
to work after six months.

307
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,718
Stop nitpicking. They come here from
banana republics torn by civil war.

308
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,668
They've been through hell and can't
even clean the floor in a resthome.

309
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,676
I'll ignore that. You broke a political
deal three days before the election.

310
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,628
All this talk about emotions
is making me thirsty.

311
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,828
Birgitte, I need you
to support my candidacy.

312
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,834
- Your statements make it hard for me.
- I'll repay you.

313
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,117
Two more cabinet posts
than your seats warrant.

314
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,317
Apart from Treasury
and Foreign Affairs, take your pick.

315
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,316
Come on. Tomorrow we'll hold a joint
press meeting where you support me.

316
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,031
And I promise you we'll find jobs
for a couple of asylum seekers -

317
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,590
- as long as you don't
go about telling everyone.

318
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,514
I understand your interest
in a marriage of convenience.

319
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,870
But I'm an old-fashioned gal,
so my answer is no.

320
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,191
Talk to you after the election.

321
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,391
- No deal. He won't take it back.
- You're making my job difficult.

322
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:23,314
You'll probably be out of it soon,
Kasper.

323
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,792
- Yes?
- Don't you recognize me?

324
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,111
- We met at the coast.
- Right.

325
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,714
Let's get you some champagne.

326
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,150
- You're back early.
- I couldn't do it.

327
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,273
If we lose one or two seats,
I'm gonna resign at the convention.

328
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,195
- More, and I'll resign on the spot.
- Who says it's gonna be that bad?

329
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,117
It's time for you to pursue your career
now. My five years are up, remember?

330
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,876
- I thought you'd forgotten our deal.
- Hardly. It was my idea.

331
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,034
Very modern of me,
if I do say so myself.

332
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,799
Five years of career for you and five
for me. Even if you did find it silly.

333
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,398
Well, it implies you're able to put
your career on hold every five years.

334
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,313
- We've managed.
- We've been lucky.

335
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,600
What if Bill Gates had asked me to be
CEO of Microsoft five years ago?

336
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,639
- You'd have turned him down.
- Sure I would.

337
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,476
Somewhat more dignified than being
voted out by the Danish people -

338
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,359
- like me the day after tomorrow.

339
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:51,310
Are you gunning for some pity sex,
or what?

340
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,194
You'd be so much better at this job.

341
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:01,798
No, because I wouldn't have been
able to turn down Laugesen.

342
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,592
Coming through.

343
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,629
Everyone speaks highly of you,
Kasper.

344
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,349
Only because they don't know me.

345
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,718
- Promise me not to go away.
- Promises are alien to my racket.

346
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,952
When a Cuban delegation
came to visit us -

347
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,035
- we had to send them outside
to smoke. Coming?

348
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,711
To smokos un cigaros
Havana Cubana.

349
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,720
If I were a cynic, I'd take a picture
of that and sell it to the media.

350
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,510
- You pissing on Parliament.
- Know what's worth pissing on?

351
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,878
This naive idea of a nation run by
the people. The people don't run crap.

352
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,750
A tiny privileged circle of people
rule Denmark.

353
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:21,357
From the corporate world, the media
and a few politicians.

354
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,799
As long as I'm part of that circle,
they can call it anything they like.

355
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,952
What have you got for me, Kasper?

356
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,716
I apologize on behalf of my leader
for the no deal.

357
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,793
- So sneak something in the back way.
- She's not fond of the back way.

358
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,999
She's a nice girl, you see.

359
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:52,829
How about you? Wouldn't you like
to work for the Prime Minister?

360
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,072
I doubt Hesselboe wants me
to replace Ole Dahl.

361
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,631
You think Hesselboe
is prime minister after the election?

362
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,311
- Not necessarily.
- Not necessarily?

363
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,755
I know something.

364
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,313
I know something that could make
the right person prime minister.

365
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,755
If used wisely.

366
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,116
I'm a wise man, Kasper.

367
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,596
I've got an unpleasant announcement
regarding Hanne Holm.

368
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,709
As you may know,
she used to have a drinking problem.

369
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,351
Yesterday I received an e-mail
that Hanne is drinking again -

370
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,353
- sent from one of our open computers.

371
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,959
TV1 can't have a drunk hosting
the pre-election party leader debate -

372
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,033
- so I've been forced
to discharge Hanne as of today.

373
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,593
Now, we have an election to cover,
so get to work. You, my office, now.

374
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,673
We need to talk.

375
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,795
Hi there.

376
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,149
Where the hell have you been?
Sick? Answer your calls!

377
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:31,509
I should fire you, but we can't afford
to lose any more good reporters.

378
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:40,991
Look, this may sound like a promotion,
but it sure as hell isn't.

379
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,836
I want you to host
the final debate tonight.

380
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,276
Did you read my speech
for the final debate tonight?

381
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:59,560
- Yes, it's fine.
- Good. Wear the black suit.

382
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,875
It looks good on TV, and it slims.
Want to run through it?

383
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,115
It comes off as a smart attempt to save
a tactically difficult situation.

384
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,273
I don't want to waste what might be
my last appearance on tactics.

385
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,512
Want a farewell speech? I can deliver.

386
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,312
And if I asked for a speech on capital
punishment, you'd say: For or against?

387
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,873
- I wasn't hired for my convictions.
- I'll be speaking to you tonight then.

388
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,909
Congratulations.

389
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,753
Or aren't congratulations due?

390
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,311
Look, I've always respected girls
who fuck their way to the top.

391
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,429
At least it's a talent.
I mean, they're good at fucking.

392
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,635
But snitching on people
who do theirjobs -

393
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,716
- is such an ugly little Danish
tradition, for which I hold no regard.

394
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,557
- You think I told...
- Drop it! Who won us the debate?

395
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,759
- Hanne, I'd never...
- Let go of me!

396
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,318
The worst thing is...
I really quite liked you.

397
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,511
- Give it up, Mom.
- Get lost!

398
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,591
Dad, talk to her.
She's too fat for that skirt.

399
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,114
- The cab will be here in five minutes.
- It'll just have to wait.

400
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,996
There.

401
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,632
If I push it down here,
it doesn't show, does it?

402
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,918
- Do I look okay?
- Want the truth or the loving version?

403
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,996
- The truth.
- Your ass is too big for that skirt.

404
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,153
- And the loving version?
- The dry cleaner shrunk it.

405
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,957
Oh.

406
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,752
Okay, it's back to the old dress then.

407
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,189
Nothing else fits. But I can't
wear this to a debate. Look.

408
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,953
The other day the kids and I
were watching you on TV.

409
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,793
Afterward Magnus asked me:

410
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,478
"Dad, am I gonna be as smart
as Mom when I grow up?"

411
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,156
We're so proud of you.
You do know that, don't you?

412
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,879
- Anyway, I need to put this on.
- So put it on.

413
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,279
Attagirl.

414
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,436
Katrine, you're 29 years old,
and you just snagged the final debate.

415
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,515
Get in there and knock
their socks off. I know you can.

416
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,992
- I keep crying, and they wonder why.
- They'll put it down to nerves.

417
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,711
Let's go. It's the final debate. I'll
drive you there in the Black Lightning.

418
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,392
Come on.

419
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,954
Check positions. Keep an eye
on background and audience.

420
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,436
- Does my panic show?
- You're one sexy lady.

421
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,150
Did you hear anything out there?

422
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,871
The Liberals and the Freedom Party
seem cocky. Beware of Laugesen.

423
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,670
The Labour guy. He's wired.
He groped my ass.

424
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,594
We'll slap a sexual harassment charge
on him. Talk to me.

425
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,788
750,000 Danes may vote differently
this time. Laugesen is after the...

426
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,430
- They're drawing lots now.
- Katrine, two minutes.

427
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,036
You're gonna be great,
because you look fantastic -

428
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,116
- and you're a brilliant reporter.
If you aren't, it's my ass on the line.

429
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,952
- The black suit's at the cleaner's.
- You look good.

430
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,954
Just relax and be yourself.
And stick to the speech.

431
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,156
Got a minute?

432
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,351
Don't use that info now.

433
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,954
Are you crazy?

434
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,157
In ten.
Katrine, you look hot.

435
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,757
Four, three, two, one.
Roll camera 3.

436
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,515
- Dad, it's on now.
- Coming, coming.

437
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,997
We're going to debate
the key election issues.

438
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,233
Each party leader will get two minutes
to deliver their closing remarks.

439
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,758
We'll shut off the mikes after two
minutes, and that goes for all of you.

440
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,914
Don't give me that look.
I promise to behave tonight.

441
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,469
That would be a first, Svend Åge.

442
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,918
- There's Mom.
- Dad, that dress is embarrassing!

443
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:46,516
We need to send Mom positive vibes.

444
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,229
Lars Hesselboe has been
Prime Minister these past seven years.

445
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,914
Michael Laugesen is after his job.

446
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,550
You're both
full of big election pledges -

447
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,032
- but let me just say on behalf of the
women voters: Size doesn't count.

448
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,034
Welcome to the Final Debate, 2010.

449
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,312
This is it. It's time for the closing
remarks from each party leader.

450
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,916
We'll begin
with Anne Sofie Lindenkrone.

451
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:27,918
I'm ashamed to be a Dane in this
selfish nation Hesselboe has created.

452
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,311
- Amir Diwan is on camera 3.
- Is Diwan with a W?

453
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,913
Yes.

454
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,757
A vote for us is a vote for a green,
financially sound Denmark.

455
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:43,118
Denmark needs a modern,
well-trained military...

456
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,679
Hesselboe on 3.

457
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:51,678
Individual freedom and initiative
is what keeps Denmark going.

458
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:56,197
Can we still take care
of our senior citizens -

459
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:01,559
- when we have to take in criminal
immigrants who travel 4,000 miles...

460
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,078
Next up is Birgitte Nyborg.
Roll 3.

461
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,959
Thank you, Svend Åge Saltum.

462
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,398
Last but one is Birgitte Nyborg.
The floor is yours.

463
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,757
All of us here have become
ever so professional.

464
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,675
We know every question, because
we check them off with the reporters.

465
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,676
She's improvising. Katrine, that isn't
her speech. She's going impro.

466
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,276
All this decides our actions.

467
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,039
I'm shocking my spin doctor right now
by not sticking to my speech.

468
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,352
I upset him by not wearing
the right clothes either.

469
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,071
The trouble is
I've gotten a bit too fat for them.

470
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,989
Zoom out and let's see the dress.
Great, stay with that.

471
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,357
I believe we must
own up to our mistakes -

472
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,557
- and admit it when
there's something we don't know.

473
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,188
I became a politician -

474
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,354
- because I once held strong views on
how this world should be. I still do.

475
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,991
I believe we're losing
what keeps Denmark together.

476
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,518
I believe, unlike the Freedom Party,
we do live in a multiethnic society -

477
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:25,797
- so it's a waste of time
to discuss how to avoid it.

478
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:30,909
I believe it's a myth that we're all
equal and share equal possibilities.

479
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:35,517
These past seven years have seen
the gap widen between poor and rich.

480
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,310
The Prime Minister will say: "Oh, but
everyone is a master of his own fate. "

481
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,474
But to believe that the free market is
the best cure for social inequality -

482
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,590
- is like saying cars will cure the
climate crisis. It's not good enough.

483
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,797
If we're to create a new Denmark
together -

484
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,990
- we have to invent a new way
of communicating and doing politics.

485
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:06,757
Words like socialism, liberalism
and solidarity just might be words -

486
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,959
- describing the world of yesterday
and not the world of tomorrow.

487
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,877
A modern world is manifold,
and so must our democracy be.

488
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,353
A vote for the Moderates tomorrow is
a vote for a new Denmark. Thank you.

489
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,278
Christ! Nyborg has really got it tonight,
hasn't she?

490
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,468
That's your mom.
You can be proud of her.

491
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,031
- So, Michael Laugesen, top that.
- You bet I will.

492
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:47,878
I prepared a speech like, well, almost
everyone else. But I can't deliver it.

493
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,672
Not after having seen proof of the
Prime Minister's arrogance of power.

494
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,038
For seven years, he's been preaching
financial responsibility to the voters.

495
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,431
How does that add up, Hesselboe -

496
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,628
- when you let the state finance
your own overconsumption?

497
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,554
- What are you talking about?
- This is a receipt.

498
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:17,637
You billed the state 12,000 dollars
for gifts to your wife, Prime Minister.

499
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,395
- Christ!
- Zoom in on the receipts.

500
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,030
What's going on? Keep going.

501
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,637
- 12,000 dollars, Lars Hesselboe!
- Don't the rules apply to us all?

502
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,158
- Let the Prime Minister reply.
- Katrine, over to him.

503
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,756
Let's give Lars Hesselboe
a chance to reply.

504
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:45,268
I don't know what receipts he's got,
but this is not the place to air them.

505
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,228
- Is this your signature, Hesselboe?
- Stop that!

506
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,679
I won't stand for
your fabricated accusations... No!

507
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,197
Talk to my lawyer.
I'm leaving this debate now.

508
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:04,750
- If that isn't an admittance...
- Follow him out.

509
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,117
All the way out.
Screw aestethics!

510
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,673
Thank you, Michael Laugesen.
The debate is over. Thank you.

511
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,676
This debate came to a somewhat
surprising end. Tune in later for more.

512
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,877
I wish you all a good election.

513
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,953
- We're off.
- Alright! Jesus Christ!

514
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,635
That was fucking great TV,
girls and boys.

515
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,874
You were great. I'm sure my daughter
wants your autograph now. Later?

516
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,554
Sure.

517
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,517
Where did Laugesen get
that information?

518
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,993
Come in at nine tomorrow
and clear your desk.

519
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,879
Bye-bye.

520
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,399
Today, the Danes will decide -

521
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,109
- who is going to rule Denmark
the next four years.

522
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,149
The polls aren't painting a clear
picture after yesterday's debate -

523
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,598
- dubbed the most chaotic ever.

524
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,030
THE PRIME MINISTER
STANDS ACCUSED

525
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,270
We'd have made a good pair
in the long run.

526
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,116
Spare me the emotions.
That's my field.

527
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,430
My keys.

528
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:10,158
And your phone. The computer, and
the campaign documents are there.

529
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,997
I told security I'd take your ID card
before you leave Parliament.

530
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,154
Thank you.

531
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,679
Birgitte! The Labour top brass are
washing their hands of Laugesen.

532
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,390
The dramatic debate is sending shock
waves throughout the Labour Party.

533
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,757
Respected former leader
Hardy Eriksen -

534
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:02,472
- calls Laugesen's behaviour
at the debate a disgrace.

535
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,589
"I no longer support Laugesen's
leadership," Hardy Eriksen says.

536
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,433
This can go any which way.

537
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,558
We'd better look sharp tonight.

538
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,913
According to the first exit polls -

539
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,438
- the Moderates are tonight's winners
with over eight seats in Parliament.

540
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,559
- Mom, you're eight points ahead.
- Seats, you moron.

541
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,829
- Don't tease.
- It's true. It just came in.

542
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,671
I hate this.
I hate this, I hate this, I hate this.

543
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,833
- Not now, Phillip. I'm in hell.
- Birgitte.

544
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,310
I made the dry cleaner buy you a new
one, seeing as he shrunk the old one.

545
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,711
I love you.

546
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,396
Things are heating up.
We expect Labour leader...

547
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,633
We're still waiting
for the key figures...

548
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,076
Are you waiting for me, or...?

549
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,118
- No, wait. Let him go in first.
- Why?

550
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,159
Mom deserves to go on TV too.

551
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,756
Prime Minister Hesselboe just arrived.
How do you feel about the result?

552
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,358
I'm shocked that this misunderstanding
had such grave political implications.

553
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,717
Your lawyer hasn't
repudiated the claim -

554
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,475
- that your wife billed the state
12,000 dollars for clothes.

555
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,556
- I assure you, there's nothing in it.
- Are you still Prime Minister?

556
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,670
Okay.

557
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,919
Hesselboe hasn't been able
to rebuff my evidence.

558
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,311
He committed fraud and must pay.
I don't regret a thing.

559
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,948
I'd like to direct your attention
to my wife's dress.

560
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,671
Ten years old,
63 dollars at the local market.

561
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,273
Here comes one of tonight's winners,
Moderate Leader, Birgitte Nyborg.

562
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,558
Remember this, honey.

563
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,154
The Moderate Party is sky-rocketing.
They've gained ten more seats.

564
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,157
This is insane!
We've gained ten seats, Birgitte.

565
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,313
What if they're useless,
because Hesselboe has enough?

566
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,031
He lost 12 seats.
He has to resign. The door is open!

567
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,317
- We're going home.
- I want to see the result.

568
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:35,519
You look beat.
Just look at your brother.

569
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,878
- Are you okay with this?
- Sure. You look like a statesman!

570
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,873
Come along, kids.

571
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,111
And the success continues.
Two more seats...

572
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,718
We now have the national result.

573
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,271
Tonight, Denmark has seen
a landslide victory.

574
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,230
The two major opponents, Laugesen
and Hesselboe, are the two losers.

575
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,790
The winner is without a doubt
the Moderate Party.

576
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,679
15 seats. I just don't get it.

577
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,392
You hit the zeitgeist. This is
the beginning of something new.

578
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:22,350
Now, thank them and lead them,
because they want to be led by you.

579
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:27,355
- What if I don't know how?
- You'll learn it along the way.

580
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:44,750
We've come a long way.

581
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,116
Commentators say the voters voted
against Labour and the Liberals -

582
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,239
- because of the showdown
between Laugesen and Hesselboe -

583
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,473
- and that void was filled
by Birgitte Nyborg...

584
