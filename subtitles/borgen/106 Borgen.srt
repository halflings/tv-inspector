1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,832
Let's go through the press release.
- It's 10:30 p. m. Get a life.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,552
I come to apologize,
and you treat me like a stalker.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,271
If you're going to work,
you'll have to go next door.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,829
Good night.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,471
Benjamin is my spinning instructor.
- Spin off and let the grown-ups talk.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,952
Don't talk to people like that.
- Are you seeing him?

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,318
"Politics is war without bloodshed. "

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,995
"War is politics with bloodshed. "
- Mao Tse-Tung.

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,912
Good morning.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,550
Tomorrow, 10.30 a. m.,
you receive Grozin.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,280
Then he has tea with the Queen.

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,513
7:30 p. m.,
gala evening at the Royal Theatre.

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,753
Gala at night,
pinstripes during the day.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,755
The dissident
Vladimir Bayanov arrived yesterday.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,993
- He and Grozin are mortal enemies.
- How do we deal with it?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,152
We praise our Danish democracy -

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,154
- for accommodating two opponents.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,074
We stress our belief
in freedom of speech and press.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,800
See you in an hour.

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,715
You father says you arranged
for him to sleep over tonight.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,668
I forgot to tell you. Sorry.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,038
Hi, Dad.
We can't wait to see you.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,955
But we're really busy,
so do you mind taking a cab?

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,514
Or the metro. Sure.
Maybe you can even borrow a scooter.

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,716
See you.

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,911
So, your Dad's paying us a visit?
- He's coming to hear this guy.

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,232
Vladimir Bayanov is giving
a poetry reading in Copenhagen.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,960
So what's the plan?

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,235
Hello! What's the plan?
- We'll just pamper him a little.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,834
I'll pamper him, you mean.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,630
This is my first state visit.
Give me just two days.

32
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,510
Great planning to have your dad
come at the same time.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,355
I'd appreciate it,
if you looked after him a bit.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,398
He's a little lonely back home.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,111
I thought he got his second wind
after the divorce.

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,273
Just one night. Two, max.

37
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,319
He always patronizes me.
- The man is a teacher.

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,635
He sees me as the evil capitalist.
- I don't want to discuss my dad.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,954
Will you help me out? Thanks.
- You don't want to discuss it?

40
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,077
Not now.
- Okay.

41
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,189
When is the PM planning
on coming home today, then?

42
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,759
GOVERNMENT
Episode 6- State Visit

43
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,439
President Grozin will be sitting here
across from you.

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,990
Will there be press photos
prior to the meeting?

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,232
What do you think?
- As little press as possible.

46
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,996
Grozin has a reputation
for being a brutal leader.

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,109
And that's why I'm passing on the
chairmanship of the OSDD to him.

48
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,592
What about the gala evening?
- The Queen is running that show.

49
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,548
We're just guests,
so sit back and enjoy it.

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,635
The Minister for Energy and Climate
has good news.

51
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,631
Show him in.

52
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,155
We closed the deal.

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,316
President Grozin is going to buy
for one billion euros wind turbines.

54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,155
They confirmed it?
- The Turgisian embassy faxed me.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,599
Both North Wind and the Ministry
for Foreign Affairs confirm it, too.

56
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,072
Grozin is signing the deal
after the press conference.

57
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,915
So your scene
at the climate summit paid off.

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,959
Denmark will be Europe's largest
export nation of green energy.

59
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,033
The Russians might very well
be next in line to buy.

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,719
Great story! The cabinet creates
more jobs, a greener environment -

61
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,873
and embarks on an exports
adventure in the former Eastern Bloc.

62
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,160
It may make the industry like us.
- Does this change our press strategy?

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,393
Yes, give them the full package.
All smiles, Birgitte.

64
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,235
Oh well, convictions
aren't carved in stone.

65
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,030
"It's an honor to pass on the torch
of democracy to the Turgisian nation -

66
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,476
as a token of my admiration
and respect... "

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,918
We don't need to admire him,
just because he buys wind turbines.

68
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,393
Have you got two minutes? I've been
asking for a meeting for 14 days.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,949
Sure.

70
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,231
Reports from Amnesty International
and Human Rights Watch -

71
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,633
describe injustices committed
by Grozin's Turgisian security service.

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,113
Amnesty says minorities are
persecuted in Turgisia.

73
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,674
I know of his reputation. Many praise
his democratic results too, though.

74
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,037
They can't even hold
democratic elections.

75
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,512
To let Grozin chair
the Organisation for Security -

76
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,276
Democracy and Development
is an outrage.

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,637
I didn't make the decision.

78
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,793
I'm just passing on
the chairmanship.

79
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,032
You're receiving him officially.

80
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,991
You would have joined in my protest
before you turned pragmatic.

81
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,917
You don't have to be pragmatic -

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,358
because you lead a party
that's hovering 1% above the hurdle.

83
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,071
I'm PM. Also for those who didn't
vote for me. Remember that.

84
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,629
Thank you.

85
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,475
Turgisia has a population of 21 mio.,
it lies near the Black Sea -

86
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,950
and is bordered by the Ukraine
and Russia.

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,513
The country seceded from the USSR
and became a republic in 1991.

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,434
Grozin was elected president in 1996.

89
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,195
In the mountain lives
the Sarkesian minority -

90
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,275
who led by Vladimir Bayanov
are fighting to gain independence.

91
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,275
Our correspondent in Russia
has sent us this report.

92
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,834
You have a minute and a half.
- Grozin, Turgisians and Sarkesians.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,152
A bit of a tongue twister, isn't it?

94
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,078
Thank you.

95
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,877
Well, what do you think?

96
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,318
You should never wear anything else.
Is it for the Royal Theater?

97
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,916
I won the draw.
- Again?

98
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,311
Impressive. You must be cheating.

99
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,598
Do you address the Queen
"ma'am" or "Your Majesty"?

100
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,877
Is this a hypothetical question?

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,319
You're right. I bet
it's going to be a boring ball.

102
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,199
Is my speech ready?
- Yes.

103
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,879
TV1 requests a comment on Bayanov's
visit and resistance to Grozin.

104
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,476
I have to pick up the kids.
- They smell blood.

105
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,031
Amnesty is holding a protest
at the same time as the gala evening.

106
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,149
Just tone it down a little.
- I can't ask Phillip to pick them up.

107
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,916
Let me pick them up.
- That's nice of you, Sanne.

108
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,709
That's really nice of you.

109
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,872
I look forward to welcoming Grozin -

110
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,637
and discussing how to strengthen
democracy in the OSDD countries.

111
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,394
Mom?

112
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,715
I'm not going to meet Bayanov, but
I don't mind him voicing his opinion.

113
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,348
Mom?

114
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,992
I'm glad he uses the opportunity
to speak freely in this country.

115
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,869
Will you be quiet?
- Magnus wet his pants.

116
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:42,594
I have to go now. Kasper Juul will
answer any further questions.

117
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,958
Why didn't you say you had to go?

118
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,955
Hi.

119
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,272
Hi. Why did you take a bath?

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,392
He wet himself.
- Okay.

121
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,553
It's the third time this month.
- You didn't tell me.

122
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,714
I did.
- Do you think anything's wrong?

123
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,032
When was the last time you watched
an afternoon movie with him?

124
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,430
I think he misses you.

125
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,115
He wins more time with you
by wetting himself.

126
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,829
Sure, blame it on me.
- I didn't say that.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,676
After this visit I'll get more time.
- Yeah right.

128
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,111
I need to talk to you about something.

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,398
Have you got North Wind shares?

130
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,949
Yes.

131
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,669
I have to ask you to sell them.

132
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,400
Why?

133
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,477
Grozin is going to place a one billion
euro order with North Wind.

134
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,030
That share hasn't been
worth much for years.

135
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,478
We cannot make a profit
off my cabinet's policy.

136
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,519
We've had those shares for years.
It's just a coincidence.

137
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,514
You have to sell them.
As soon as possible.

138
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,435
Look... Are you serious?

139
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,789
I'd like to talk to you
about my shares with North Wind.

140
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,919
Granddad!
- Guess who!

141
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,231
Welcome to Copenhagen.
- Good to see you.

142
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,393
Hiya, champ.
- Hi, granddad.

143
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,509
Do your thugs check everyone?
- Only you.

144
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,958
My bodyguards
are just doing their job.

145
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,554
What's eating you?

146
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,271
I just sold some shares
at a considerable loss.

147
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,878
I thought you were good at that stuff.
Oh well, money's just paper.

148
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,276
How was your trip?

149
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,236
Who are you interviewing?
- Vladimir Bayanov.

150
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,676
A Turgisian poet and dissident.

151
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,798
Katrine, let's go over the script.

152
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,637
We open with Bayanov.
He's on his way over.

153
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,590
Let's go over the script
after you've changed.

154
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,232
Hi. Is this a bad time?
- I'm a little busy.

155
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,518
Let's meet later.
- I'll call you when I get off.

156
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,672
Okay. Bye.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,152
Somebody got themselves
a young boyfriend.

158
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,995
He's not my boyfriend.
- What is he then?

159
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,391
I don't know.
- Are you seeing anyone else?

160
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,189
He's not my boyfriend.
Are we done here?

161
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,511
Thanks.

162
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,110
Are you alright?
- Oh, sorry. Yes, I'm fine.

163
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,990
Vladimir Bayanov. I believe
I'm being interrogated by you?

164
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
Yes.

165
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,192
Would you like us to go over some
of my topics before we start?

166
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,749
Why?
- Well, just...

167
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,277
No. I have nothing to hide.
You can ask me anything.

168
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,754
I'm not President Grozin.
- Of course not. Welcome.

169
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,708
"In a single word,
my life will start anew. "

170
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,796
"I was born to know you,
to call you by your name: Freedom. "

171
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,919
Man, that's good. Mind if I cram
some culture into your kids?

172
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,789
No, I only have commerce
and football to offer them.

173
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,270
Are we out of wine?

174
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,149
Bayanov is fantastic.
The house was packed.

175
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,757
I felt like a kindred spirit.
There's an old rebel in me, too.

176
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,675
Hi, Bjørn.
- The Turgisian embassy faxed us.

177
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,913
They want us to arrest Bayanov
and extradite him.

178
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,675
Arrest him for what?
- Terror and high treason.

179
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,231
Various crimes against Turgisia.
The list is long.

180
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,710
- Any evidence?
- Just a long list of accusations.

181
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,318
Write it off as a routine enquiry.
- Are you sure?

182
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,914
According to your ministry -

183
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,311
Bayanov has been living
in exile for 10 years.

184
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,553
Grozin has tried to have him
extradited numerous times.

185
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,875
And now he's trying again.
We won't comply.

186
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,274
Who's going to be arrested?
- You weren't supposed to hear.

187
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,558
Bayanov?
- I can't tell you.

188
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
What does democracy mean to you?

189
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,395
- It's like asking what love means.
- Please elaborate.

190
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,680
Well, it's so difficult to explain,
but yet so easy to understand.

191
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,752
We would not die without democracy -

192
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,151
but democracy develops
the human race.

193
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,475
It forces us to embrace and understand
those who think differently.

194
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,033
You are one of the most prominent
members of the Sarkesian minority -

195
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,352
who is fighting for an independent
state, often with violent methods.

196
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,876
Do you find that violence
is sometimes necessary?

197
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,353
Yes, violence is necessary because
Grozin is trying to destroy my people.

198
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,114
Should we not defend ourselves?

199
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,238
But sometimes the Sarkesians
do more than that.

200
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,235
There have been bombs killing
civilians and other acts of terrorism.

201
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,235
Do you sympathize with that?
- Politics is war without bloodshed.

202
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,394
But war is politics with bloodshed.
- That doesn't answer my question.

203
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,228
Before Chairman Mao became
the leader of a great nation -

204
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,470
he was called a terrorist.

205
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,395
Before Yitzhak Shamir became PM,
he too was called a terrorist.

206
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,758
If you win your war, you're
remembered as a great politican.

207
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,675
If you lose, you're remembered
for being a terrorist.

208
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,435
Mr. Bayanov,
are you a terrorist?

209
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,593
Is Grozin?

210
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,633
Thank you very much
for coming in today.

211
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,392
Hi, beautiful.

212
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,828
Anything wrong earlier?
- What?

213
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,237
Would you rather I didn't stop by?

214
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,231
No.

215
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,031
Maybe.

216
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,469
I mean, it's my job.
I don't want to get things mixed up.

217
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,192
We're not getting married tomorrow.
- No. It's okay.

218
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,630
Katrine.
- Call that an interview?

219
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:20,878
What's your problem?
- Are you alone?

220
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,272
Look, my boss evaluates me.
You don't always have to call.

221
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,470
I hope they gave you hell
for flirting with your interviewee.

222
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,712
I'm not listening to this. Bye.

223
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,273
Ready? Here we go. Voilà.

224
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,677
Good morning.
Pancakes and coffee in two minutes.

225
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,960
I borrowed your bathrobe. Okay?
- Sure.

226
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,557
Good morning. What's this?
- My tux.

227
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,349
But it's tails.
- Oh, I thought...

228
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,877
I'll call my secretary.
- No, I'll handle it.

229
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,156
Where are you going?
- The Royal Theatre.

230
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,915
Go get dressed
before you eat pancakes.

231
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,072
Get well soon.

232
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,360
Trine is sick and can't come tonight.
- You're kidding.

233
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,274
What's up?
- The sitter just cancelled.

234
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,398
I'd better stay another night then.

235
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,758
Do you mean that, Dad?
- Sure. Anything to help.

236
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,990
Great.

237
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,552
Turgisian President Grozin is here
to take over the chairmanship -

238
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,393
of OSDD.

239
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,394
Grozin has just arrived
at Parliament -

240
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,714
where Birgitte Nyborg will receive
him and introduce him to her cabinet.

241
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,910
Welcome to Denmark.

242
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,428
Has Turgesia placed an order with
North Wind worth one billion euros?

243
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:39,119
Turgesia, too, has a responsibility
to reduce its CO2 emissions.

244
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,751
We believe that our future
lies in wind energy.

245
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,754
But can you confirm
that you have placed the order?

246
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,038
We'll take questions later.
Mr. Grozin, please come this way.

247
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,793
I understand that Vladimir Bayanov
has not been arrested.

248
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,677
Correct. We received a request for
the arrest of Mr. Bayanov yesterday.

249
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,072
And?
- It was simply a list of accusations.

250
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,755
As you're probably aware,
we can't act without evidence.

251
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,593
Bayanov is a well-known terrorist.

252
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,630
There's no international arrest order
on him. I mean no disrespect.

253
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:42,351
It's impossible for me to arrest
a man who's legally in the country.

254
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,877
Legally? Bayanov?
- He's here to talk about his poetry.

255
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,350
Let me tell you
about Mr. Bayanov's real poetry.

256
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,991
Bayanov was the brain behind the
bombing of our police headquarters -

257
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,390
last month.

258
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,918
The Chief of Police and
five other men on duty were killed.

259
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,551
And almost 20 other people
were badly wounded.

260
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,918
There is your evidence,
Mrs. Prime Minister.

261
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,910
Have the Ministry for Justice
assess this rightaway.

262
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,275
We will be looking into this.

263
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,592
What's up?
- What have you done with Bayanov?

264
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,038
I did a fine interview.
- Yes, very fine.

265
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,953
It was fucking good.

266
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,033
All the international networks
want to use the interview.

267
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,158
Congrats. Now, do you mind...

268
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,599
Let's get Grozin to comment on it.
Meet Bayanov somewhere in town.

269
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,036
I want you to follow up
on Bayanov and Grozin.

270
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,272
Get cracking.

271
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,678
What do we know about the bombing?

272
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,156
Is she available?
- Better try later.

273
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,915
He'll be here shortly.
Close the door.

274
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,551
Well, find out and get back to me.

275
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,190
Are you going to arrest Bayanov?
- Not if I can avoid it.

276
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,956
I know it's bad press.
- It may be worse not to.

277
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,113
The international media know
we have both Grozin -

278
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,479
and the "terrorist" out to overthrow
him. The BBC asks for a comment.

279
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,471
Not now.

280
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,555
The Minister for Justice.
- Hi, Troels.

281
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,590
What do you think of the evidence?
- We can't say if Bayanov's innocent.

282
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,914
My legal people don't consider
the evidence conclusive.

283
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,428
Bayanov may have been connected
to some bomb people at one time.

284
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,718
Can I say the case doesn't hold up?
- No.

285
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,953
We can arrest him
under the new terror laws -

286
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,432
that give the police wide powers.

287
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,354
Exactly why my party voted
against the terror package.

288
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,877
I can hardly use it
to arrest an innocent man.

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,832
It's a serious matter not to act.
- Let's say we're looking into it.

290
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,472
How long is Bayanov staying?
- We need to make him leave.

291
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,599
That would solve our problem.
- But how?

292
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,630
We'll leak Grozin's request
for his arrest and hope he skips town.

293
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,510
What if he doesn't?
- He will. The guy's not an idiot.

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,515
You're due at the theatre
in an hour and 20 minutes.

295
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,549
Okay, so the plan is to get Bayanov
to leave, if possible.

296
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,595
Thanks.

297
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,236
You called?

298
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,717
Has anyone seen the jewelry
I had in a little black box?

299
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,635
On the desk.
- Fancy, huh? Cuff links and earrings.

300
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,794
They're beautiful!
The PM's Office borrowed them.

301
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,671
What about the Grand Cross?
- My party doesn't accept orders, you.

302
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,710
When will you be back?
- After you go to bed.

303
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,192
We'll have fun. Have you ever
tried my cardamom waffles?

304
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,433
This is ridiculous.
- No, it's my job.

305
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,878
It's your job to accompany me.
- Three steps behind her.

306
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,237
Thank you. What time is it?

307
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,916
You look amazing.
- At last you look like newlyweds.

308
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,188
I need to go.
- Quick!

309
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,638
We'll shake the water off the lily.
Get going.

310
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,110
Pretend you're married.
- They are.

311
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,909
Aren't you?
- See you.

312
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,516
Tonight we're transmitting live -

313
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,435
- from the gala performance
of "Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky.

314
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,319
Keep an eye out for Grozin.

315
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,790
Birgitte Nyborg
accompanied by her husband.

316
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,990
Your mom is the most beautiful woman
in the goddamn world.

317
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,799
The spitting image of your grandma.

318
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,398
Bayanov just spoke
at the Amnesty protest.

319
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:08,714
He's going to go on TV1 and leak
the news about the arrest order.

320
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,113
Dammit! Tell Höx to get Intelligence
to lean on Bayanov.

321
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,874
Honey, you have guests.

322
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,670
Mr. Grozin. Lovely to see you again.
- The pleasure's all mine.

323
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,435
My wife Irina.
- Enchanted. Nice to meet you.

324
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,160
This is my husband Phillip.

325
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,914
Did you tell Bayanov about the arrest?

326
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,753
I'll tell him.

327
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,596
All hell is breaking loose. BBC just
ran breaking news on Bayanov.

328
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,436
Turgesian authorities link him to
the bombing of police headquarters.

329
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,912
Shit.
I'll ask him for a comment on that.

330
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,438
If he's behind a terror attack
in his own country...

331
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,555
I can't put him on the air.
The Director General is concerned.

332
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,271
We don't know if he's guilty.
- But if he is...

333
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,594
In your interview he almost
condoned terror, live on the air.

334
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,829
This could be huge.
We can't back out now.

335
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,551
I have to clear it
with the Director General.

336
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,359
Do you want me to go?

337
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:35,992
Yes, dammit. But if he turns out
to be a terrorist, we won't run it.

338
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,197
Understood?
- Yes.

339
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,830
Keep your cell switched on.

340
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,116
The Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs wants us to arrest Bayanov.

341
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,637
He criticizes us for not acting.
We have to do something.

342
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,634
We're warning him as we speak.

343
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,713
Hopefully he's leaving the country
right now.

344
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,712
- We've reached the interim.
- Let's hear about the menu.

345
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,714
The Queen is hosting
a standing souper.

346
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,431
The menu offers lumpsucker canapé,
salmon and shrimp -

347
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,273
- and croustade with game.

348
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,870
Bayanov isn't leaving. TV1 just
announced an interview with him.

349
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,476
Mr. Grozin, I understand...

350
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,760
I understand that Bayanov is still
a free man giving interviews on TV.

351
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,517
And the BBC knew
that we wanted him arrested -

352
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,753
and warned him one hour ago.
How did they get story?

353
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,753
I've no idea. You're not implying...

354
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,879
Why has the Danish PM chosen -

355
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,589
to stand by a terrorist instead
of the next chairman of the OSDD?

356
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,311
Here we see Birgitte Nyborg
entertaining President Grozin.

357
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,869
He has still not been arrested.

358
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,874
Do the lives of eight Turgisian
policemen mean nothing to you?

359
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,273
Of course they do, but I cannot
pre-empt a police investigation.

360
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,274
The Prime Minister can order
Bayanov detained -

361
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,274
until the police investigate
the matter.

362
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,910
A lack of goodwill on your part
must force me -

363
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,551
to reconsider my investment
in Danish wind energy.

364
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,349
Why should I place a billion euros -

365
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,308
in a country that does not care
for my people's security?

366
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,794
I strongly recommend immediate
action and the arrest of Bayanov.

367
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,591
Now the German Chancellor
is backing the arrest.

368
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,995
Russia wants him arrested. The world
press is whipping up the story.

369
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,073
You have to consider arresting him.

370
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,715
We can always release him again.

371
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,276
Arrest him, but discreetly.

372
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,397
Have you got a warrant?
Is this legal?

373
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,513
Why are you arresting him?

374
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,953
We have free press in Denmark.

375
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,195
Viggo, over here.

376
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,269
Poet and dissident Vladimir Bayanov
has just been arrested.

377
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,389
In the last 3 years, 71 political
activists have disappeared in Turgisia.

378
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,757
Will Bayanov be number 72?

379
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,630
PM Birgitte Nyborg finally gave in
to international pressure.

380
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,836
You arrested Bayanov?
- Dad...

381
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,676
Do you know what goes on
in Grozin's socalled democracy?

382
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,995
You don't know what's going on.
- You arrested him without evidence.

383
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,628
Or is that a lie?

384
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,315
Mommy sure is
wearing the breeches, huh?

385
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,392
Stop it.

386
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,469
What a fabulous evening.

387
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,468
Can I take this dress to bed?
- You had your share of champagne.

388
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,191
We didn't get to dance. Come on.

389
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,356
Yes, let's dance.

390
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,278
You treat women like shit,
don't you, Kasper?

391
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,194
Vicious rumors.

392
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,995
I need these documents copied for
a Security Council meeting tomorrow.

393
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,079
Don't shit where you eat.

394
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,028
Good little proverb, don't you think?

395
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,716
Did you see Katrine Fønsmark's
report on Bayanov's arrest?

396
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,589
No? Well, maybe you should.

397
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,473
Why are you arresting him?

398
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,110
Why is he being arrested?
Have you got a warrant?

399
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,197
Poet and dissident Vladimir Bayanov
has just been arrested.

400
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,194
In the last 3 years,
71 political activists...

401
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,397
Gunning for the Cavling Price,
are you?

402
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,711
- I don't have time for this now.
- I don't care.

403
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,998
I'm not alone.
Let's talk tomorrow.

404
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,679
Who's there with you?
- Does it matter?

405
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,672
Your littlejock?
- Yes.

406
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,868
Katrine, I just want to...
Katrine?

407
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,110
Come here.

408
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,991
We can't keep at it, Benjamin.
- Hey, speak for yourself.

409
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,431
Yes.

410
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,750
What do you want?

411
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,436
I give you a scoop,
and this is how you thank me?

412
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,036
You hung up on me.
- You were dissing me.

413
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,909
Anyway, I told you I had company.

414
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,753
That's why you came.

415
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,799
I just want to...
- Hi.

416
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,588
Hi, Benjamin.

417
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,630
Are you dating?
- Stop it. You're drunk and stupid.

418
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,678
I just said hi.
- Hi. Bye.

419
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,991
But are you dating?

420
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,035
Benjamin, you scored way out
of your league. I think he's ugly.

421
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,158
Go home!
- Want me to get rid of him?

422
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,154
Go inside and wait.
- She told you to go inside.

423
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,073
She told you to get lost!

424
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,232
Calm down, for fuck's sake!
- Let him go, Benjamin.

425
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,639
Fucking idiot!

426
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,672
Let's go outside and talk.

427
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,358
I'll be right back.

428
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,552
Kasper, go home
and let's try to forget this.

429
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:14,030
A spinning instructor!
What the hell were you thinking?

430
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,512
He's studying at the university.
- Let's all play Trivial Pursuit, then.

431
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,752
What the hell is your problem?
- He's not...

432
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,879
He's not good enough for you.

433
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,668
What the hell are you doing?

434
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,150
We can't see each other
in private anymore.

435
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,348
It just won't work.
Now go on home.

436
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,156
Go home.

437
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,954
You couldn't sleep either?
You get that from me, I think.

438
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:03,078
Thanks for the great genes.

439
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,473
I'm sorry I flew into a rage earlier.

440
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,431
It was unfair of me.
- It's okay.

441
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,752
A nightcap?
- Maybe we shouldn't, Dad.

442
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,632
Right.

443
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,432
It's just that
you reminded me of your mother.

444
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,072
She was hard
just before the divorce.

445
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,588
I'm PM. I don't know
if you can imagine...

446
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,038
I don't necessarily love
all the decisions I have to make.

447
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,195
You're okay,
Phillip and you and the kids?

448
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,350
Sure.
- So were we the first couple of years.

449
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,874
But suddenly we stopped talking.

450
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,789
I've always told you
how happy I was with the divorce -

451
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,192
and how much better
my life has been ever since.

452
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,952
It's not true.

453
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,278
I miss your mother every day.

454
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,034
That divorce is the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

455
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,469
That's why I have the odd drink
now and then.

456
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,632
I know, Dad.

457
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,676
Birgitte, promise me one thing.

458
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:20,234
Promise me that you and Phillip
will always stay together.

459
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,832
I promise, Dad.

460
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,034
Good morning.

461
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,794
You're up early.

462
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,396
When is your dad leaving?
- Today. Why?

463
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,317
Talk to him.
- I have a Security Council meeting.

464
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,678
Maybe you could talk to him.
- No. He's your dad.

465
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,958
I'm too tired to talk about this now.

466
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,078
I'll talk to him.

467
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,949
But as he's leaving today,
I don't really see the point.

468
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,957
I'll wake the kids.

469
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,878
Good morning.

470
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,999
Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Please.

471
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,273
Got any milk?
- Sure.

472
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,949
Yes... Yes, of course.

473
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,949
Grozin wants Bayanov extradited.
- That's out of the question.

474
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,954
What's the procedure?
- His request isn't unreasonable.

475
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,908
OSDD is all about the membership
countries helping each other.

476
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,198
The only OSDD country
opposed to it is France.

477
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,354
How long can we detain him?
- We need to get him out ASAP.

478
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,153
A terror suspect in a Danish prison
could cause security problems galore.

479
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,836
Nothing under Danish law
prevents the extradition.

480
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,151
He'll be executed
within 24 hours, but hey...

481
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,154
Turgisia abolished capital punishment
six years ago.

482
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,711
Still, 71 of Grozin's political
opponents disappeared last year.

483
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,952
Or so Amnesty International claims.

484
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,989
We can't hand him over.
- You want to sell your wind turbines?

485
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,233
Don't you?
- Not if we have to commit a crime.

486
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,598
The Greens can't hand over
a dissident to an uncertain fate -

487
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,309
just to sell our wind turbines.

488
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,952
How much is a human life worth?
- This is a ridiculous discussion.

489
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:00,114
One billion is a lot of money. Maybe
the Russians will buy wind turbines.

490
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,635
If we corner that market...

491
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,397
Are we debating if Bayanov's head
is worth one billion in exports?

492
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,512
We're just about to pass on the
chairmanship of the OSDD to Grozin.

493
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,639
You must have faith in him
as a democrat.

494
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,271
Faith in an man guilty
of human rights violations?

495
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,594
Neither you nor your party
need to back this.

496
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,912
Denmark is extraditing a terror suspect
according to the law.

497
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,437
The law is not up for discussion.
- We need to make a decision.

498
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,752
Soon you'll be next door
for your photo shoot with Grozin.

499
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:48,595
We don't have to make a decision.
I have to.

500
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,435
Let's sign the extradition agreement
after the ceremony.

501
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,637
And now I want to be alone.

502
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,554
Good morning, Mr. President.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

503
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:04,549
Mr. President, are you ready
for the press conference?

504
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,113
Excuse me. Could I have a moment
alone with the President, please?

505
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,473
Of course.

506
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,556
You too.

507
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,918
Would you care to sit down?
- Thank you.

508
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,309
What will happen to Bayanov
if we hand him over?

509
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,876
Let's not discuss that
on a day of celebration like this.

510
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,316
I can't hand him over,
if you won't tell me.

511
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,350
That is for the Turgesian people and
the Turgesian legal system to decide.

512
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,799
I mean no offence, but I really need
to know more than that.

513
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:03,433
Let me ask you a question.
Why do you consider yourself -

514
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:07,309
a better and more democratic
leader than I?

515
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,109
Why would you ask me that?
- Oh, I think you know.

516
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,355
How old is the Danish democracy?
160 years? Ours is 20 years old.

517
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,832
It takes time, Mrs. Prime Minister.
It takes time.

518
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,154
The Turgisian people are not used
to being asked, but to being told.

519
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:32,838
It is in the... DNA of my people
to obey the leader.

520
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:38,430
So if I understand you correctly -

521
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,718
it is you who will decide
what will happen to Bayanov?

522
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,715
Are we playing games?
- I hope not. A man's life is at stake.

523
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,714
When our democracy is 160 years old,
we can talk.

524
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,749
Until then I will not take any more
arrogant lessons from you.

525
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,790
Hand over Bayanov before
I sign any contract with North Wind.

526
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,839
By the way, I understand
it is your custom -

527
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,357
to pick the journalists yourself
at the press conference.

528
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:19,308
Well, I have a favor to ask of you.

529
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,798
Here is a list of journalists that
I do not wish to take questions from.

530
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,838
Please respect that.

531
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,789
"My nation believes
in the principle of free press -

532
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,159
and will uphold and defend this
in our constitution. " Recognize it?

533
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,269
It's part of the OSDD treaty you're
signing today as the new chairman.

534
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,275
There is a time and place for
free press. Today is not one of them.

535
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,477
No more games,
Mrs. Prime Minister.

536
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,713
Make sure Grozin gets this question.

537
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,232
We need your help.
- I don't want to talk to you.

538
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,234
Ask Grozin about this.
- Are you dictating my questions?

539
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,756
You have to.
- We have free press in this country.

540
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,593
You get the final question.

541
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,911
Believe me,
it's a question you want to ask.

542
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,755
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
please take your seats.

543
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,153
Yes?
- Lindsay McGuilder, Guardian.

544
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:01,074
Is President Grozin satisfied
with the arrest of Vladimir Bayanov?

545
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,236
Yes, I'm very happy with the help we
have received from our Danish friends.

546
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,199
TV1.

547
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,399
How strong is the evidence
against Bayanov?

548
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:19,315
That is a question for the Danish
police. I cannot comment on that.

549
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,597
Was that the last question?

550
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:27,436
Before we end this press conference,
I'd like to say that...

551
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:32,435
The President and I have noticed the
criticism in the international media -

552
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:39,790
that Turgisia is taking
over the chairmanship for the OSDD.

553
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:46,433
But I'd like to quote President Grozin
from his inaugeration speech in 1996.

554
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,593
"Democracy is not a principle
you can bend. "

555
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,513
"It's either or, it's yes or no -

556
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:58,435
and today my nation, Turgisia,
has chosen to say yes to democracy. "

557
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:06,949
I think we have the time forjust
one last question. Katrine Fønsmark?

558
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,272
Yes. This is for President Grozin.

559
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,830
Does your investment in Danish
wind technology depend -

560
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,596
on the arrest and handing over
of Vladimir Bayanov?

561
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,189
I have great faith
in the Danish legal system -

562
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,558
and I can assure you
that I do not link -

563
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,475
the wind energy deal
with the case against Bayanov.

564
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,189
And thank you.
I think that was the last question.

565
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,913
I really appreciate your answer
to the last question -

566
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,789
because I'm not
going to hand him over.

567
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,633
And thank you very much.
- Thank you.

568
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:28,468
What's going on?
- Your dad's staying the weekend.

569
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:32,918
I just can't stand it,
even if he is a sweet old hippie.

570
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:37,835
I'm going to stay at a hotel.
- Wait. Give me two minutes.

571
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,351
Hi, Dad.

572
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,911
I've decided to stay the weekend,
so we can get some time together.

573
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,318
We haven't seen much of each other.
- No.

574
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,354
Dad, you can't.

575
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,399
I need some time alone with Phillip.

576
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:06,759
And Phillip needs his bathrobe,
his coffee and his red wine.

577
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,752
I need to keep the promise
I gave you last night.

578
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,913
Yes. I understand.

579
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:21,470
I'll pack my things.

580
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,311
Bayanov, who has been detained
in Denmark the last couple of days -

581
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,994
left the country tonight.

582
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,709
He was satisfied with the outcome
and flew on to Paris -

583
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,714
to talk
at a human rights conference.

584
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,156
President Grozin finished
his state visit today.

585
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,596
After having taken over
the chairmanship of the OSDD -

586
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,629
- he signed a deal with Danish
wind turbine company North Wind.

587
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,874
Turgisia has questioned
a number of the terms in the deal -

588
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,350
- so the deal isn't closed yet.

589
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,037
The kids are asleep.
- Okay.

590
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,988
Were they sorry to see him leave?
- A bit.

591
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:24,113
But you're happy, I hope.

592
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:31,160
Well, let's tidy up.
- No, I'll do that.

593
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,075
But first I want you to stay put
while I get...

594
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:42,034
...the best Turgisian wine there is.

595
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:46,318
One of the perks of the state visit.

596
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,308
I can't pronounce it, but it means
"the blood of the martyr".

597
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,040
Yup.

598
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,232
Well?

599
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,716
You do know
that your wife loves you?

600
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,031
I love her, too.

601
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,790
But I don't know about the PM.

602
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,958
