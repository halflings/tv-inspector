Do you have

Uh, actually,

Actually, you're

I spoke with some officers
at the station recently,

And i think we cleared up
all the questions they had.

Well, i have
different questions.

They're about

Three cars blown up,
three more totaled.

Apparently, we have a one-man
wrecking crew on our hands.

Well, how can you be
so sure it's a man?

00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:50,100
We're celebrating
birthdays now?

159
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,634
We always did.
don't you remember sixth grade?

160
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,567
Your friend billy kane
was there.

161
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:56,067
<i>it was his party, mom.</i>

162
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,100
Well, it's never too late.

163
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:01,067
All right, where are we
getting takeout from?

164
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,200
Who said anything
about takeout?

165

Howard!

167
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,167
So, you coming or not?
i'll try.

168
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:11,400
Michael, i don't want
to hear how you'll try.
i want you to promise.

169
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,801
<i>fine.
i promise i'll try.</i>

170
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,400

You can stop now!

175
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:51,200
Ugh! oh!

176
00:07:51,267 --> 00:07:54,400
Howard...

177
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,834
We just want
to see your son.

178
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,734
Oh, you don't understand.

179
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,067
I'm sure whatever the
issue is, you can work
it out with your ex.

180
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,501
No! that's not
what i mean.

181
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:04,868
He was kidnapped.

182
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:08,133
Of course he was.

183
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,434
Brandon didn't come home
from school on thursday.

184
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,100
I got a call. uh, i don't
know the guy's name.

185
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,334
Is he asking for money?

186
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,067
No, i-i-i work
at a diamond wholesaler.

187
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:22,234
He wanted information
about an upcoming shipment.

188
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,934
Said not to contact
the police,

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,701
Or i'd never...

190
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,834
See brandon again.

191
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:31,267
He's calling today
with instructions.

192
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:32,634
How could you
not tell me?

193
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:35,167
I didn't want you calling
the police, patricia.

194
00:08:35,234 --> 00:08:36,634
I was trying
to protect brandon.

195
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,501
That was not your decision
to make! he's my son, too!

196
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:42,567
Look, he just wants diamonds.
i'm going to give them to him.

197
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,434
Howard,
it's not that simple.

198
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,334
If this guy really
wants to disappear,

199
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,267
He has no incentive
to return your son.

200
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:51,434
Brandon's old enough
to identify him.

201
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:53,367
Whoa, whoa, w-what --
what are you saying?

202
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:55,334
You know what
he's saying, howard.

203
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,234
They're not gonna bring us
brandon back alive!

204
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,467
We should call the police.
no!

205
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,501
No cops!
he said he would kill him.

206
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:01,868
Enough.

207
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,667
Michael and i will
take care of him...

208
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:09,534
...without involving
the cops.

209
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,501
But you can't be at
each other's throats, okay?

210
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,200
When the kidnapper
calls again,

211
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:15,434
You're going to say
you're not doing anything

212
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:18,000
Until you get proof that
your son is alive and unhurt,

213
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,434
And then you're gonna ask
for a face-to-face meeting.

214
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:21,834
You think he'll come?

215
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,667
If he wants his diamonds,
he will.

216
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:25,734
And if we're lucky,
we'll follow him back
to where brandon is.

217
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,601
Well, won't that
be dangerous?

218
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,734
It doesn't matter.
i'll do it.

219
00:09:29,801 --> 00:09:31,934
Whatever it takes
to get brandon back.

220
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,534
I told howard not to take
that stupid job.

221
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,200
Sales manager.

222
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,968
We were doing
just fine as reps.

223
00:09:47,033 --> 00:09:48,934
You work together?
we did.

224
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
It was great till
he took that promotion.

225
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:55,033
Long hours, travel,
and now this.

226
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,868
<i>well, i'm sure this
was not part of the plan</i>

227
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:58,133
When he took the job.

228
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,534
Well, he should have
known the risk.

229
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,501
Patricia, i want you
to try something.

230
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:09,234
It's a relaxation exercise
i do in situations like this.

231
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,834
I want you
to close your eyes...

232
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,367
And breathe deep.

233
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:15,968
Picture a peaceful
mountain stream.

234
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,000
Can you do that?

235
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:20,934
Now picture yourself...

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,033
Drowning the kidnapper
in the stream.

237
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,501
You're taking a rock
from the stream

238
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,167
And raising it
above your head...

You're not calling

You did everything right,
howard.

292
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,033
He said he wants the stones

293
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,000
Or brandon dies.

294

Uh, not so great.

297
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:09,133
Santora didn't
go near the kid.

He's hanging out at a bar,
sipping mojitos.

299
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,300
Mike, this guy's
not afraid to be seen.

300
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,701
But i thought you could follow
him to where brandon is.

301
00:13:16,767 --> 00:13:17,934
I thought --
he's smart.

302

He's keeping the job
compartmentalized.

303

Howard's at the hospital
getting stitches.

304

That was all for nothing?!

305
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,467
Not nothing.
we'll know when he moves.

306
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:26,934
I got a buddy
keeping an eye on him.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,901
Why can't you just grab him and
waterboard him or something,

308
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:31,701
Make him tell us
where brandon is?

309

You torture somebody,

310

They'll tell you anything
to make it stop.

311

No, there are better ways
to get reliable information.

Yes, or you could give us

when you rented it.

Sam:
who told you?

A friend of a friend.

I didn't get his name.

488

They didn't give me details.
i didn't ask for them.

They wanted a place
that they could stash him

I found it.
can i go now?

You can go when i find out
what the hell is going on.

were planning this?

Oh, come on, you think
they're gonna tell me when?

499
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,567
Yeah, right after
they told me

Their vacation plans and their
social security numbers.

You got a smart mouth.

Maybe you should start
using it to save your ass.

504
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:31,868
They told me...
to find a place...

Where they could
stash the kid...

Right.
do you think i'm stupid?

510

I tell you that,

511
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,267
And you're gonna go tell them
and i'm gonna get killed.

You worry about that later.

Now, listen, i assume there
isn't a sign on the place

That says "the kid is here,"

630
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:44,684
<i>searching for a concealed enemy
who could be anywhere</i>

631
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:46,050
<i>is a waste of time.</i>

632
00:26:46,117 --> 00:26:47,517
Yeah, it's jimmy.

633
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:52,784
Nobody's heard of "flowers"
at the diner.

634
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,417
<i>usually, your best bet
is to stay put</i>

635
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:58,950
<i>and give your enemy
a reason to come to you.</i>

636
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:02,417
What's going on?

637
00:27:02,484 --> 00:27:04,751
Is there something
i should know about?

638
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,517
Don't worry about it.

639
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:09,017
Just get back to the house
and watch the kid.
[ camera shutter clicks ]

640
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,884
<i>to tail someone, you need
both skill and instinct.</i>

641
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:21,483
<i>you need skill
because the driving is tough.</i>

642
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,084
<i>you can't get too close,</i>

643
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:24,917
<i>and you can't drift
too far away.</i>

644
00:27:24,984 --> 00:27:27,617
<i>you can't go too fast
or too slow.</i>

645
00:27:27,684 --> 00:27:29,851
<i>you need instinct
because every turn,</i>

646
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:32,650
<i>every lane change, every bridge
raises the risk of being seen.</i>

647
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:36,750
<i>anyone can be trained
to follow a car.</i>

648
00:27:36,817 --> 00:27:38,184
<i>but it takes good instincts</i>

649
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:40,184
<i>to know when it's time
to stop following.</i>

650
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:49,784
So, i had one of my guys
ask around.

651
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,318
No one at that restaurant

652
00:27:51,383 --> 00:27:53,117
Ever heard of anyone
named flowers.

653
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:55,117
Why is that m-my fault?

654
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:57,951
Maybe he went
to the wrong place.

655
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,350
He went to the diner,
you lying son of a bitch.

656
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,984
Why would i lie to you?

657
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:04,550
That's it.

658
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:08,984
I'm shutting this thing down
before it gets any worse.

659
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:10,884
<i>when you work
with someone long enough,</i>

660
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:12,851
<i>you learn to trust them.</i>

661
00:28:12,917 --> 00:28:15,017
<i>when things go bad,</i>

662
00:28:15,084 --> 00:28:18,483
<i>that trust is the difference
between life and death.</i>

663
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:22,051
<i>of course, knowing that doesn't
make it less terrifying</i>

664
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,017
<i>to back a play
you know nothing about.</i>

665
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:26,184
Listen, uh...

666
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,350
I know this guy, shep.

667
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:31,550
I mean, he's a pain in the ass,
but his information is good.

668
00:28:31,617 --> 00:28:34,717
Yeah? because he told
me some story about a
guy who doesn't exist?

669
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:36,717
Maybe the guy does exist.

670
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,450
He could be one
of your own guys.

671
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:46,717
So, one more time...

672
00:28:46,784 --> 00:28:50,017
This flowers guy...

673
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:51,350
What did he look like?

674
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:56,851
He has, uh,
slicked-back hair.

675
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,750
He was a muscle guy.

676
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:01,617
Uh...

677
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:03,251
He wears
those muscle shirts,

678
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:04,984
You know,
to show off his arms.

679
00:29:05,051 --> 00:29:07,483
That's the best i can do.
that's all i got.

680
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,817
That's flowers?
you're sure?

681
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:13,784
Yeah, that's the guy
who told me about the kid.

682
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:18,917
Ugh!

683
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:19,817
Hey, hey!

684
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,151
What is wrong
with you?

685
00:29:24,218 --> 00:29:25,650
Santora:
that's my guy.

686
00:29:25,717 --> 00:29:29,151
Like you said, my own guy
is trying to steal from me.

687
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:30,483
What guy?

688
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,251
His name's jimmy.

689
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:34,517
The guy i sent to the diner
to look for flowers --

690
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,750
<i>it turns out the son
of a bitch is flowers.</i>

691
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,350
He's supposed to be
watching the kid.

692
00:29:38,417 --> 00:29:41,917
Instead, he's planning
to rip me off.

693
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,784
You know,
you can call it off.

694
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,350
Let the kid go.

695
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,817
Hell, just give him to me.

696
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,784
I'll tell his parents i found
him wandering around.

697
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:50,318
It's too late for that.

698
00:29:50,383 --> 00:29:53,350
He saw my face.
it's over.

699
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:54,917
I got to clean
this whole mess up.

700
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,084
Whoa, whoa, what are you
gonna with that?

701
00:29:58,151 --> 00:30:00,383
Listen, you've been
a stand-up guy.

702
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,717
I appreciate that.

703
00:30:01,784 --> 00:30:03,584
And i don't want
to cause you problems.

704
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,051
But that guy
in there, shep...

705
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,417
He's got to die.

706
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:11,184
Now.

707
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,017
<i>every profession

on my interview.

713
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:32,950
Back off.

714
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:34,217
This is my snitch.

715
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:36,884
I got to be able
to explain what goes on.

716
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,417
My own guys
are turning on me.

717
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:39,651
If he's part of it,
he's got to go.

718
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:40,818
They all do.

719
00:30:40,884 --> 00:30:42,617
Oh, i see, so i'm just
supposed to sit back

720
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:44,284
And hope none of this
blows back on me?

721
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,517
No way, pal.
that's not how this goes down.

722
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,451
You got any ideas?
i'm listening.

723
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:52,284
Yeah.

724
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,451
Yeah, i say that, uh...

725
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,150
Dropped him off by the road.

726
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:58,284
I let him out 'cause
he was sick from the dope.

727
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,384
I'll just tell them that --
that he attacked me,

728
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:01,950
And he tried to escape.

729
00:31:02,017 --> 00:31:03,250
Wait, you?

730
00:31:03,317 --> 00:31:05,384
Yeah. don't you remember?
he's my prisoner.

731
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:06,950
How am i gonna
explain a suspect

732
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,950
That's full of these
random bullet holes?

733
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:12,050
We'll have the damn fbi here.
it's better this way.

734
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,851
Put a few rounds
in his chest with my gun,

735
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:16,017
But you do it out by the road,
you understand?

736
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:19,317
Your gun? what the hell
are you talking about?

737
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:22,651
Look, i got to be able to sell
this story to my department.

If i don't,
they're coming after me.

Santora's planning on
going back to the kid.

752
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,384
Fi followed their guy.

753
00:32:05,451 --> 00:32:07,851
They're holed up on an island
off the causeway.

And the bad news?

755

Santora wants
to kill you first.

to do it with my gun

Up on the side
of the road,

How far is the road?

760

A couple hundred yards.

761
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,284
I guess it'll have to do.

762
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,484
Mike, if there was
any other way...

763
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:25,918
There isn't.

764
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:27,651
All right,
when you get free,

765
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:29,684
Take his car
and head to the causeway.

766

Man, you don't
want to do this.

I mean,
why shut this down?

There's money
to be made here, man.

we could split it 50/50.
