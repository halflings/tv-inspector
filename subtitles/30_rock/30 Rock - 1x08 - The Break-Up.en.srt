00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:05,839
- Hey
- Hi, babe.

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,925
Dennis, what are you doing?

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:11,220
I'm gonna mount a TV on your wall.
I just can't find a stud.

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,847
So you made nine holes
in my wall?

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,098
No, those are
for the shelves, dummy.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,643
The TV is gonna go right here.
It's gonna be awesome.

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,728
It's gonna be--
It's gonna be like a hospital.

9
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,940
Oh, Dennis,
I don't want a hospital TV.

10
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,440
I don't want a shelf...
Whose horse is that?

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,275
That's my cousin Teddy's
Great Dane.

12
00:00:29,445 --> 00:00:30,579
I told him I'd watch him
for a couple weeks.

13
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:33,958
'cause Teddy broke his ankle
running from some black guys
that pulled a gun on him.

14
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,660
Now, why is it important to tell me
that the muggers were black?

15
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,282
They weren't muggers.
They were cops.

16
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:40,790
So why don't you just say
he was running from some cops?

17
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,252
I don't know, I mean,
you're a racist for assuming
that they weren't cops.

18
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:45,671
Uhh!

19
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,253
You know I'm allergic to dogs.

20
00:00:47,426 --> 00:00:51,090
Ack, allergies
are all mental.

21
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:52,513
Hey.

22
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:53,593
Who the hell is this?

23
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:54,972
That's Teddy.

24
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,142
Get out.
I want you out of here!

25
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,723
You can't kick me out.
I love you!

26
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,850
No, no, get your stuff
and get out.

27
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:02,140
I'm not doing this anymore.

28
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,231
You can't kick me out.
I got squatter's rights.

29
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:06,441
Which is it: you love me
or you got squatter's rights?

30
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:08,523
I don't see why
they're mutually exclusive!

31
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:10,322
Ohh!

32
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:11,230
Thank you.

33
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:13,071
Oh, Liz, finally.

34
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,780
It's about time
you broke up with him.

35
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,150
He's a comple loser.

36
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,572
Oh, Jenna, don't say that.

37
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,162
You know, he had
some good moments.

38
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:21,623
Hi.

39
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:24,541
I got donuts.

40
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:28,540
What's up, brown eyes?
I made chili.

41
00:01:28,717 --> 00:01:30,343
Hey...

42
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:34,842
You wanna...
wanna order cheese steaks?

43
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:37,091
I guess they were mostly food related.

44
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,303
But he was always nice to me.

45
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:40,890
Oh, that's okay.

46
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,561
Cry it out, sister.

47
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,601
No, I'm not crying.

48
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,433
I'm allergic
to the stupid Great Dane.

49
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,193
That thing licked
my eyes this morning.

50
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:48,100
Wait a minute.

51
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,151
Dennis and the dog
are still in your apartment?

52
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,153
I gave him a week
to find a new place.

53
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:53,073
Ugh.

54
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,153
We're completely broken up.

55
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,900
If that's true, then I'm
taking you out to celebrate.

56
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,161
A girls' night.
We'll meet some new people.

57
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,370
Oh, you mean like
at a discotheque?

58
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,990
Oh, boy.

59
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:27,560
So when can we
see each other again?

60
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,770
What are you wearing?

61
00:02:29,947 --> 00:02:31,771
Black dress?

62
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:34,193
Black stockings?

63
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,571
A funeral, oh.

64
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,610
I'm sorry, okay.

65
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,241
Let me call you back
in an hour... yeah, bye.

66
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:40,200
Why are you cryig?

67
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,872
The Liberty lose again last night?

68
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:42,743
I'm not crying.

69
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:43,833
I have allergies.

70
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,411
Allergies are all
in the mind, Lemon.

71
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,000
I use to have a wicked
peanut allergy.

72
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:50,172
And now, witness.

73
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:53,591
As I'm sure you surmised from that call,
I'm seeing a woman of late.

74
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:55,001
Yeah, who's the lucky lady?

75
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,011
Let's just say she's a high-ranking
African-American member of the Bush administration.

76
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,473
Are you dating Condoleeza Rice?

77
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,012
I'm not at liberty to say.

78
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:06,100
The point is,
my lady friend is an egghead,
much like yourself.

79
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:08,852
 Not my usual thing,
and I need your advice.

80
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:10,522
We're having a lot of
trouble connecting lately.

81
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:11,440
She does a lot of traveling.

82
00:03:11,606 --> 00:03:13,150
Yeah, and it must be hard for
her to get cell phone reception

83
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:15,861
when she's so far up
the president's butt.

84
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:19,152
I'm choosing to ignore that remark
on the basis that you are a godless,

85
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,992
glassy-eyed Clintonista.

86
00:03:21,157 --> 00:03:23,281
Now, I wanted to get my friend
something personal.

87
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:25,871
Do you think she would prefer
this handsome attaché,

88
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,661
which says, "You are a woman of substance,
and I respect you,"

89
00:03:28,837 --> 00:03:29,661
 or...

90
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:33,080
this collection of ladies' unmentionables
with snaps and openings all over the place?

91
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:34,291
Attaché!

92
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,843
I see, okay.

93
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,342
Jenna to the floor, please.

94
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:38,922
Yeah, it's pretty good.

95
00:03:39,097 --> 00:03:40,921
But I think the boobs 
should swing more.

96
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,220
Yeah, then I could go:
Rodney, don't make me come over there

97
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:47,351
and beat you in the head
with one of my boom-booms!"

98
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:48,523
Yeah.

99
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:50,102
This is just appalling.

100
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:51,603
What's your problem?

101
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,563
I just think it's demeaning
for a black man to do drag.

102
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,321
What? Everybody loves
a dude in a dress.

103
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,110
I mean, those are the best
Bugs Bunnies.

104
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,742
Frank, there are large pockets
of African-American culture

105
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,492
that  Caucasians
know nothing about.

106
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,240
The stigma of drag
is one of them.

107
00:04:05,418 --> 00:04:06,331
Whatever.

108
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:07,623
I've played a woman before.

109
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:10,951
 Hunky Grandma Be Trippin'
made $96 million.

110
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,503
All I'm saying is--
is drag is a way for Caucasians

111
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,540
to emasculate you and
make you seem non-threatening.

112
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,671
We never would have stooped
so low on Black Frasier.

113
00:04:19,848 --> 00:04:20,670
Black Frasier?

114
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,722
Niles, this Beaujolais is impeccable.

115
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,680
It's both fruity and precocious.

116
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:32,853
That's not the only thing around here
that's fruity and precocious.

117
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,271
I never heard of Black Frasier.

118
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:34,601
What?

119
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:35,943
It was huge on BET.

120
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:38,902
Every Thursday night
at about 9:00 or 9:15.

121
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:39,652
Think about it, Tracy.

122
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:42,821
All the best African-American comedians
refuse to do drag.

123
00:04:42,997 --> 00:04:45,570
Chris Rock doesn't do it.
Dr. Cosby doesn't do it.

124
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:49,741
Bernie Mac doesn't do it
'cause he'd be ugly as hell.

125
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:50,992
Forget it.

126
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,250
I'm not wearing this dress.
It's prejudicial.

127
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:55,960
Thanks a lot.

128
00:04:56,128 --> 00:04:58,293
Now what am I supposed to do
with this sketch?

129
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,460
I'll do it.

130
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:05,222
I mean, my parents raised me
as a girl for, like, ten years.

131
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:08,973
What?
I told you guys that.

132
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:10,472
That's our show for tonight!

133
00:05:10,646 --> 00:05:11,970
See you next week!

134
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,810
Good night!

135
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,572
That's okay,
we'll think of something.

136
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,613
All right, I'll see you.

137
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:24,991
Monday night
is girls' night.

138
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,911
I'm taking you out, 9:30.

139
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:30,121
I know this great karaoke place
where you can get a pedicure while you sing.

140
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,372
Oh, Jenna,
I'll go anywhere.

141
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,501
Just,  please, no more karaoke.
Not after our last duet.

142
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,833
When I'm right here,
you need to be here.

143
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,000
Not here.
Here is embarrassing.

144
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,505
Okay, fine.

145
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,639
I didn't say that.
I said you're a beautiful woman.

146
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,888
It wouldn't hurt to try
something different with your hair.

147
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:45,473
Check this out.

148
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,840
I think Jack
is dating Condi Rice.

149
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:49,762
Oh, God, that's huge!

150
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:53,222
Oh, no, no.
I never said braces.
I said bonding.

151
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,602
Dude, that Shamanda character
was the best thing of the night..

152
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,522
What was her line?
Say it again.

153
00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,650
Rodney!

154
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:05,693
Don't make me come over there
and beat on you with my boom-booms!

155
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:08,281
You burned me!

156
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,582
There's nothing wrong
with a black comedian wearing a dress.

157
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,293
Eddie does it, Martin does it,
Jamie Foxx, Flip Wilson.

158
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,623
Whoopi Goldberg does it every day!

159
00:06:17,797 --> 00:06:19,213
You stole
a franchise from me!

160
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:23,340
Shamanda could have been a movie!

161
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,841
Okay, you need to write
something great for him

162
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,760
before this becomes
a problem.

163
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:30,591
I wouldn't even know where to begin
writing for a guy like that.

164
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,562
Then write something with him.

165
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,812
Our comedy gotta do more
than make people laugh.

166
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:44,071
Gotta make people think.

167
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,981
I wanna hold a mirror up to society,

168
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,953
and then win world record
for biggest mirror.

169
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,110
He's totally right.

170
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,781
Gotta be raw!

171
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:53,281
Uh-huh.

172
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,082
I got a concept for a sketch
I think you might like.

173
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:59,410
You and Jenna play Sleestaks
from Land of the Lost

174
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,542
and you're trying to get
a small business loan.

175
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,212
What?

176
00:07:02,386 --> 00:07:08,261
Because you want to
open up a pancake house
called Slee's Stacks.

177
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,340
Are you black?

178
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,691
Jack, is everything all right?

179
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:24,062
I think I figured out why things have been
so rocky with my lady friend.

180
00:07:24,237 --> 00:07:26,362
I'm on the street.
I can barely hear you.

181
00:07:26,535 --> 00:07:28,401
She's cheating on me, Liz.

182
00:07:28,578 --> 00:07:31,242
I think there's another man
in the picture.

183
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,411
Are you sure, Jack?

184
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:36,240
'Cause she kind of seems
like an honest lady.

185
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,452
I know what I know.

186
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:43,131
Next time I see Putin,
I'm gonna kick his teeth in.

187
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,590
Oh, here it is!

188
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:45,213
Izzle.

189
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:48,133
"A suffix that can be used
to take the place of anything."

190
00:07:48,307 --> 00:07:50,342
Well, now you're just
being patronizzle.

191
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:51,882
You know who would
love this argument?

192
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:55,390
My racist grandfather.

193
00:07:56,146 --> 00:07:59,522
I thought writing with you was gonna be
like two brothers writing together.

194
00:07:59,685 --> 00:08:01,563
We're not even speaking
the same language.

195
00:08:01,736 --> 00:08:02,190
That's right.

196
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:03,191
I'm speaking English.

197
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:04,273
Just listen,
just listen.

198
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:06,192
 Come on, who raised you?

199
00:08:06,365 --> 00:08:08,282
Standing there
with your pants that fit.

200
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,991
Using a wallet.
Drinking Starbucks.

201
00:08:11,155 --> 00:08:12,242
And what is this?

202
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,492
That's my Harvard a capella
group the Crocodillos.

203
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,203
I had a solo
in Like A Prayer.

204
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:18,290
Come on!
Where's your heritage?

205
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,831
My brother!
My homeboy!

206
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,373
My n--

207
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,002
Hey, sorry I'm late.

208
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:29,801
Thank God you're here.

209
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:31,472
This place is creeping me out.

210
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,592
I don't think I can do this.

211
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,891
You're gonna be great.
They're cute.

212
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:37,471
Do  you think
they're Wall Street guys?

213
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:42,183
Yeah, I think they're from the firm of Date-Rape,
Coke-ington Cheeseball, and Jag.

214
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,482
You've got to give this a chance.

215
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:47,151
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

216
00:08:47,316 --> 00:08:50,652
Oh, really, dude?
I gotta move my coat?

217
00:08:50,826 --> 00:08:53,990
There's like four empty seats down there.
Can't you just be cool?

218
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,413
Ugh.

219
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:58,530
That guy wanted
to buy you a drink.

220
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,453
Really?

221
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,162
I already have a drink.

222
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:02,700
Do you think he'd buy me
mozzarella sticks?

223
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:04,332
What is the matter with you?

224
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:07,250
I don't know!
I'm just nervous and rusty.

225
00:09:07,427 --> 00:09:10,213
Well, just relax
and be yourself.

226
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:14,341
Can I have a martini, please?
Hi.

227
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,721
Oh, he knows where
Bin Laden is, come on!

228
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:20,971
The Carlyle Group.
The Unocal Pipeline.

229
00:09:21,148 --> 00:09:22,892
The assassination
of Olof Palme.

230
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,733
Come on, the proof
is in the pudding.

231
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,851
Ooh, these are good.

232
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,482
Really, you think she looks
like Jessica Simpson?

233
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:33,191
You could put a long, blonde wig on a ferret
and it would like Jessica Simpson.

234
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:37,451
And by the way, Jessica Simpson would think
that you are old and gross.

235
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,160
 So good luck with that.

236
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,581
I really didn't think
I was gonna meet anybody tonight,

237
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:45,963
but you and I have
so much in common.

238
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,253
Also, you have really pretty eyes.
Oh, hi.

239
00:09:49,426 --> 00:09:55,760
I learned the truth at seventeen.
That love was meant for beauty queens.

240
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:57,842
Hey, you're bumming us out.

241
00:09:58,017 --> 00:10:01,431
And high school girls
with clear skin smiles.

242
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:04,732
Who married young and then retired.

243
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:07,140
Whoa

244
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:11,573
I thought bars were open till 4:00.

245
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,782
Nope, 11:30.
Let's get you to bed.

246
00:10:18,497 --> 00:10:20,241
... from human resources.

247
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,243
Hi.

248
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,452
He told me that Toofer filed
the harassment complaint against Tracy.

249
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:25,413
What?

250
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:27,871
Now I have to attend 
sensitivity training.

251
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:29,671
What seems to be
the problem, Toofer?

252
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:33,921
Mr. Jordan called me...
the N-word.

253
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:36,422
And?

254
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,220
And I was really offended.

255
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,142
Because...

256
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,970
Because it's a racial slur.

257
00:10:42,147 --> 00:10:44,353
Brothers talk
to other brothers like that.

258
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:45,682
I was being friendly.

259
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:47,023
  Yes, Toofer.

260
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:50,401
You see, in the last decade or so
the African-American community

261
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,900
has re-appropriated that word
as a way of depriving it of its meaning.

262
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,573
Just don't try to tell
my girlfriend that.

263
00:10:57,805 --> 00:11:02,203
Yeah, Toofer, I really don't think
Tracy was trying to offend you.

264
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,283
It's okay for us
to use it with each other.

265
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:09,333
You can call me that.
It's a term of endearment.

266
00:11:11,177 --> 00:11:13,751
Look, I'm not trying
to cause any trouble.

267
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,301
And I confess I appreciate
what you do for the show.

268
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:19,880
I want you to be my brother,
my homeboy, my n--

269
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,973
Whoa!

270
00:11:22,145 --> 00:11:22,893
This meeting is adjourned.

271
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,182
No cool, homie!

272
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,102
You might as well spread me
down with a fire hose.

273
00:11:26,275 --> 00:11:28,643
Just sounds so hateful
coming from you! Ugh!

274
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:32,443
I wish to file a complaint.

275
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:36,281
Hey.

276
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,990
Dennis, what are you doing here?

277
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,741
Hey, I'm moving into
my new apartment.

278
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,111
So I got one last thing
to say to you,

279
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:46,793
and then I'll be
out of your life forever.

280
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:48,793
"Dear Liz Lemon,

281
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,581
"While other women
have bigger boobs than you,

282
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,920
"no woman has
as big a heart.

283
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,500
"When I saw you getting ready to go out

284
00:11:55,677 --> 00:11:57,503
"and get nailed by a bunch
of guys last night,

285
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,630
"I knew for sure
it was over between us.

286
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:04,341
"And for the first time
since the '86 World Series, I cried".

287
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:06,432
"I cried like a big dumb homo".

288
00:12:06,606 --> 00:12:09,890
"And if it was up to me,
we would be together forever.

289
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:12,902
"But there's a new thing
called 'women's liberation'

290
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,611
"which gives you women
the right to choose,

291
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:15,942
"and you have chosen to abort me.

292
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:17,941
"And that I must live with.

293
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:20,823
"So tonight when you arrive
home, I'll be gone.

294
00:12:20,997 --> 00:12:25,702
I officially renounced
my squatter's rights."

295
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,450
I'll always love you.

296
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,952
Good-bye and good luck.

297
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,460
I'll never forget you.

298
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:39,710
And that is why
we are no longer a couple.

299
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:41,762
The guy just came in here
and bared his soul to you.

300
00:12:41,925 --> 00:12:44,471
What are you, made of stone?

301
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,891
Am I crazy?
The guy's a disaster, right?

302
00:12:47,055 --> 00:12:47,932
Well, I don't know.

303
00:12:48,105 --> 00:12:49,773
I mean, yeah, he's a little
"bridge and tunnel,"

304
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:52,311
but you did say
you had some good times.

305
00:12:52,488 --> 00:12:55,400
No, no, no, he had
his bad moments too.

306
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:56,942
Hey.

307
00:12:57,118 --> 00:12:57,940
Threesome?

308
00:12:58,117 --> 00:12:59,361
How about it, huh?

309
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,071
Mmm!

310
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:02,033
I'm just saying...

311
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,650
after last night...

312
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,322
maybe he's not such
a bad choice.

313
00:13:06,498 --> 00:13:08,831
You are suggesting
that I get back with Dennis.

314
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:09,830
Maybe.

315
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:10,950
Look, you're a writer.

316
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,211
Write a list of Dennis'
pros and cons.

317
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:15,082
It's a very helpful exercise.

318
00:13:15,256 --> 00:13:17,332
It's how I decided
to get a scooter instead of a bike.

319
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,673
Ah.

320
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,013
Well, you have to admit
there's always time for Tony Blair.

321
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,762
There's always time
for Bashar al-Assad.

322
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:28,973
But there's never any time for Jack Donaghy,
and that's a problem.

323
00:13:29,145 --> 00:13:32,933
Go ahead, take the call, yeah.

324
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:36,443
Hey, Dennis, you drop by
to say hi to Liz?

325
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,773
You mean the ex-future Mrs. Dennis?

326
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,152
She dumped me again.

327
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:41,533
I'm sorry to hear that.

328
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:45,532
Yeah, you know, you try to make some people happy,
but it doesn't work all the time.

329
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,952
Tell me about it.

330
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,322
What, you?

331
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:50,032
I really can't go into detail.

332
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,792
It's about when my woman
and I are together,

333
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,502
it's mindblowing.
It's, uh...

334
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,622
It's filthy, really.

335
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:57,422
So what's the problem?

336
00:13:57,585 --> 00:13:58,253
Well, she works all the time.

337
00:13:58,425 --> 00:13:59,710
She's always traveling,
it's a headache.

338
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:00,713
Who needs that?

339
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,462
That's why I'm always dating 20-year-olds.

340
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:04,883
Nah, let me tell you about
20-year-olds, my friend.

341
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:07,970
Half of them are 16.
You want some advice?

342
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:10,853
It's hard for alpha males like you and me
to put our egos aside,

343
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,020
but if she's worth it,
you make it work.

344
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,351
It's like my cousin Teddy's dog.

345
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,850
Sometimes he just
doesn't wanna lick my feet.

346
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:21,571
So what I do is,
I hide my feet from him for a couple of days,

347
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:24,192
and then when he sees them,
he goes bananas.

348
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:28,820
So Jack, in this example,
Liz is the dog.

349
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:31,121
And I am my feet.

350
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,703
You see what I'm saying?

351
00:14:33,877 --> 00:14:36,041
Yes, I believe I do.

352
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:39,713
Each of you is here because
you are insensitive to a co-worker, okay?

353
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:43,553
You might've used one of the words
I call the "uh-oh" words.

354
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,923
Such as, slut.

355
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,882
Ho.

356
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:49,263
Uh, bitch.

357
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:50,973
Biyatch.

358
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,353
Queerburger.

359
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,762
Faggotron.

360
00:14:53,936 --> 00:14:55,523
Gaybird.

361
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,600
Uh, the word for black
in any language,

362
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:02,153
Néro, noir, schwartz,
negro, kam-an-sek.

363
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:03,773
Hmm?

364
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:06,240
So.
What else?

365
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:08,570
What else can we not call
each other?

366
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:10,032
How 'bout sweaty greaseball?

367
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,990
Ooh, very good.
That's highly offensive.

368
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:14,282
Person of color.

369
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,370
Guess if you say it like that.

370
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:19,291
Sneaky Taiwanese tranny
who stole my watch.

371
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,130
Ho-ho!
Yes!

372
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,293
These words are terrible.

373
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:28,381
But today, we are going
to learn to communicate in a different way.

374
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:33,391
And I would like to start
with Tracy and James.

375
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:34,761
Guys?

376
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:38,733
Now, I understand that the two of you
got into a big 'ol conflict yesterday.

377
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,152
And...let's work this out.
Tracy.

378
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:44,403
What did you really want
to say to James?

379
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,282
I'm tryin' to tell him
he's my brother.

380
00:15:46,448 --> 00:15:47,403
We're the only two blacks 
on the show.

381
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,281
We have to figure out
a way to work together.

382
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:53,623
Like professor Martin Luther King said,
I have a feeling.

383
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:59,540
It's Dr. Martin Luther King,
and he did not have a feeling,
he had a dream.

384
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,290
Ah, dude wear khakis.

385
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:03,002
Uncle Tom,
party of one.

386
00:16:03,177 --> 00:16:04,880
Uncle Tom,
party of one.

387
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:07,751
You can't call someone that
if you've never read the book!

388
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:08,920
What  book?

389
00:16:09,097 --> 00:16:10,223
You know what I think?

390
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:13,643
I think you're ashamed of being black,
and you're an embarrassment to your community!

391
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:14,802
I embarrass you.

392
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,722
You embarrass me,
and you know why?

393
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,271
Because there are racist people
in this world,

394
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:23,650
and when they see you
act like a fool,
they assume we're all fools.

395
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:26,480
That's it!
This is it.

396
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,233
This is the sketch we should do.

397
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:28,901
What?

398
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:30,860
Right here, you and me!

399
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:34,572
This is deep stuff goin' on.
We gotta write this.

400
00:16:34,747 --> 00:16:35,533
You're right.

401
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:37,371
Ah-ha-ha!

402
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,790
Dr. Snoo,
thank you very much!

403
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:39,162
Smew.

404
00:16:39,336 --> 00:16:41,710
Oh. Oh.
Okay.

405
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:45,462
That's really against the rules.

406
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:48,050
Dennis?

407
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:56,643
Oh, my God.

408
00:17:04,658 --> 00:17:10,570
"I know this might be emotional for you,
so there's a meatball sub in the fridge."

409
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:12,901
Oh!

410
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:22,830
"Pro.
Fixed TV."

411
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:28,421
Huh.

412
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,713
Hello, I'm Star Jones.

413
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:35,131
And welcome to the Star Jones
Gastric Bypass Cooking Show.

414
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:36,932
Mmm.

415
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,140
Liz, what happened to the race
relations sketch Tracy and I wrote?

416
00:17:40,316 --> 00:17:44,022
Oh, we only had time for one more bit,
and Tracy picked this. I'm sorry.

417
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:48,813
Now you know,
I can only eat small portions.

418
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:53,400
Oh, my goodness!
Dessert.

419
00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:00,910
Okay, he's right,
this is funnier.

420
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:14,510
- Guess where I was last night.
- Mark Foley's pajama party.

421
00:18:14,675 --> 00:18:16,011
No.

422
00:18:16,188 --> 00:18:16,933
Kandahar.

423
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,890
Afghanistan?

424
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:18,262
Yeah.

425
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,561
Took the corporate jet to hook up
with my neo-con inamorata.

426
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,020
Well, I'm glad things are working out
for you and your mystery lady.

427
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:25,982
Well actually, they're not.

428
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,312
I broke up with her.

429
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:28,152
Really?

430
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:28,853
What happened?

431
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:30,521
Well, I finally realized
that we're not compatible.

432
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:33,691
I mean, I'm all for fantasy
role-play, but Abu-Ghraib?

433
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:35,611
Well, you know, relationships end.

434
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:37,033
People...move on.

435
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:39,073
But I'm glad at least
I gave it a shot.

436
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:41,953
Thank Dennis
for making me do that.

437
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:42,782
Dennis?

438
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:43,910
Yep.

439
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:46,410
You know, I might've been
too hard on that guy.

440
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,173
He's okay.

441
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:51,592
Hmm.

442
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:57,972
"Jack likes Dennis.

443
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:03,060
"Jack likes Dennis."

444
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:12,362
At Snapple, when young fruit ripens,
they may want to combine with other fruit.

445
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

446
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,571
I just, um, just wanted to drop off
your Christmas present.

447
00:19:17,748 --> 00:19:19,402
I had already bought it
for you, so...

448
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:20,451
Oh...

449
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,990
It's a fancy briefcase, you know,
'cause you're classy and important.

450
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:25,371
Like a dude.

451
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:26,373
Thank you, Dennis.

452
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:29,462
I, uh, also got you some antihistamine.

453
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:33,172
In case the next guy you're with,
you know, has a dog
and you wanna stay with him.

454
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,630
Anyway.

455
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,840
Do wanna eat?

456
00:19:38,016 --> 00:19:38,673
What?

457
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:39,800
I got all this Chinese food.

458
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,553
I'm never gonna finish it
by myself, so...

459
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,263
For real?

460
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:49,231
Should I, um,
grab a plate?

461
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,730
Yeah.
Get me a diet soda.

462
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:53,193
Okay.

463
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,481
Good evening and welcome
to Dateline.

464
00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:00,450
Chris Hansen has our latest investigation--

465
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,992
Hello?

466
00:20:03,747 --> 00:20:04,241
Good evening, sir.

467
00:20:04,418 --> 00:20:06,290
I'm Chris Hansen
with Dateline NBC.

468
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,330
Can I ask you what
you're doing here tonight?

469
00:20:08,506 --> 00:20:10,373
Oh, yeah, I'm here to boff
some chick named Mary.

470
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,252
Boff some chick--

471
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:12,292
Oh, my God.

472
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:13,711
Do you know how old Mary is?

473
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,041
Yeah, uh, 22.
I think.

474
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,253
You wanna try again?

475
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:19,212
Crap.

476
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,180
That girl said she was 16,
but I swear to God
I could tell she was 22.

477
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,762
Get out of my apartment!

478
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:26,563
This happened while
we were broken up.

479
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,060
No, no, no, no.
I was right about you!

480
00:20:29,226 --> 00:20:33,020
This is a con, by the way.
You on Dateline is a con!

481
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:33,851
You know what?

482
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:34,980
I knew you wouldn't be cool about this.

483
00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:35,981
We're finished.

484
00:20:36,157 --> 00:20:38,403
You can't break up with me.
I already broke up with you!

485
00:20:38,577 --> 00:20:38,863
Fine!

486
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,572
Then we agree to disagree!

00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
