00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,546
I'm not a creative type
like you,

168
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,904
with your work sneakers
and your left-handedness.

169
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,550
I can't do what you do.

170
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,009
I know,
I dropped the ball.

171
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:16,552
I was just trying to do
what you said,

172
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:18,051
and have a personal life.

173
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,210
And I guess I got caught up
with this new guy.

174
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,459
Oh, right, flower guy.

175
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,707
His name is Floyd.

176
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,118
That's unfortunate.

177
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:25,862
I'd really like you
to meet him, Jack.

178
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,059
Fine.

179
00:06:27,065 --> 00:06:28,760
I'd like to meet the man
that made Liz Lemon

180
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,024
shirk her responsibilities.

181
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:32,764
Let's say Persil, 9:00.

182
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:33,973
Be sure to wear a tie.

183
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,068
Are you sure you're okay?

184
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:43,375
I pitched my Jefferson movie
to Don Geiss.

185
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,583
He said no.

186
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,980
He said people only see movies
because of the previews,

187
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:49,886
and he couldn't visualize
my Jefferson preview.

188
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:52,385
He wants me to do
Fat Bitch 2instead.

189
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,388
Well, that doesn't even
make sense.

190
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:56,952
Everyone knows Fat Bitch died
at the end.

191
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,953
It's not the kind of stuff
I want to do anymore, Ken.

192
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:01,498
I want to be
taken seriously.

193
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:02,502
What should I do?

194
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:04,957
Well, remember
when Fat Bitch called

195
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:06,959
all her dog friends
together,

196
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:08,160
and they used their
high-pitched howling

197
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:09,407
to mess up the--
You're right, K.

198
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,004
I should make my own
Jefferson preview,

199
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,312
and show it to Don Geiss.

200
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:17,470
I'm never gonna finish
this bikini

201
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,074
before Nana's birthday.

202
00:07:21,114 --> 00:07:22,877
Hey, Liz Lemon,
where you going?

203
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:24,021
Uh, home.

204
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,524
I gotta go get ready
for a dinner with Jack.

205
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,479
Listen, I'm gonna need
to make a fake trailer

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,626
for my Jefferson film.

207
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,025
I'm gonna need the
entire resources of the show

208
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:32,280
for no more than
three weeks.

209
00:07:32,324 --> 00:07:33,218
You in?

210
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:34,720
No-wha
No.

211
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:35,780
Tracy,
you're not doing that.

212
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,329
We have a show on Friday.

213
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,227
Liz Lemon, you are
my Alexander Hamilton.

214
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,834
I don't know
what that means.

215
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,699
Writers, listen.

216
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:45,537
I need your help.

217
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:49,048
Well, I hope this isn't
too boring for you.

218
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,204
Are you kidding?

219
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:51,344
Jack Donaghy's a legend.

220
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:52,444
I've read his book,
like, 20 times.

221
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:54,051
Jack wrote a book?
Yeah.

222
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,552
Jack Attack:
The Art of Aggression

223
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,848
in Business.

224
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,803
Oh, no.

225
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,055
(Floyd)
He got here before us.

226
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,914
You're not supposed
to let that happen.

227
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,814
That's chapter two
in the book.

228
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:07,164
Hi, Jack.

229
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,755
This is Floyd.

230
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:10,867
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

231
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,316
Well, you're Floyd.

232
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,226
The only other Floyd
I ever knew

233
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,528
was this Korean barber
who used to cut my hair

234
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,471
down in the 50th Street
subway station.

235
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:19,731
That's my dad.

236
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:21,934
I'm Floyd, Jr.

237
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:23,976
I-I'm just kidding.

238
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:25,938
Well, please.

239
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,379
Sorry.

240
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:28,880
I'm just nervous
to meet the head

241
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:30,143
of east coast television

242
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:31,748
and microwave oven
programming.

243
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,341
I just got the word
from Geiss

244
00:08:33,384 --> 00:08:35,281
they're taking me
off microwave.

245
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,195
Oh, no.
Really?

246
00:08:37,252 --> 00:08:39,494
Mr. Donaghy,

247
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,498
with all due respect
to Mr. Geiss,

248
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,346
I gotta say he's making
a terrible mistake.

249
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,661
This company's stability
in the small-appliance market

250
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,851
is in large part
your doing.

251
00:08:47,854 --> 00:08:50,401
The dedicated popcorn setting
on your microwave

252
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:53,211
was the imagination
breakthrough of 1995.

253
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:57,170
In 2002, you increased
corporate earnings by 3%,

254
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:59,410
while the country suffered
through a recession.

255
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,918
AndAttack of the Clones,

256
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,214
which was seriously
the worst

257
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:03,414
of theStar Wars--

258
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,922
One sec, Liz, one sec.

259
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,718
And on a personal note, sir,

260
00:09:06,724 --> 00:09:07,812
in my mind,

261
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:09,425
the Foo Fighters' song
Best of You

262
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,283
is about your
managerial skills.

263
00:09:14,226 --> 00:09:15,884
Lemon, I want
to kiss your boyfriend

264
00:09:15,927 --> 00:09:17,039
on the mouth.

265
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,733
Chapter 12.

266
00:09:19,738 --> 00:09:21,538
I thought you were
gonna do it.

267
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,638
What are you drinking?

268
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,096
Club soda.
Oh, that's a shame.

269
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,242
Pete!
[snaps fingers]

270
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:29,303
[gasps]

271
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:30,302
Hey, Liz Lemon.

272
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,505
Could you go away
for a while?

273
00:09:31,548 --> 00:09:33,558
I gotta get rid
of Freddie's erection.

274
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,947
Explain what is
happening here.

275
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,249
Freddie is playing
the part

276
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:39,656
of Thomas Jefferson's horse
Caractacus.

277
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,013
We needed a place
to keep him

278
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:41,960
till we shoot his stunts.

279
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:44,957
No, acy, I told you
not to do this.

280
00:09:44,965 --> 00:09:46,457
Jack said I could.

281
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:48,064
This movie is my destiny.

282
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,167
It's the reason why God
put me on this earth.

283
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,170
[sighs]

284
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,269
I'll take you
off this earth.

285
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:55,423
(Phoebe)
The overwhelming violence
of the subject matter

286
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,674
is in deliberate
juxtaposition

287
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,479
with the pastoral beauty
of the terrain.

288
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:02,426
Jack, Tracy put a horse
in my office.

289
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:05,185
Lemon, you've met--
Hello.

290
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,371
You probably don't
remember me--I'm Phoebe.

291
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,374
We met the other day.

292
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:09,343
Yeah, yeah,
I remember you.

293
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:10,786
I'm Liz.
Oh, sorry.

294
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,939
I don't shake hands.

295
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,879
I have Avian Bone Syndrome.

296
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:14,993
Oh, boy, okay.

297
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:16,650
Hollow bones.

298
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,097
Lemon, I want your opinion.

299
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:19,753
Which ofthese two
do you like?

300
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,794
They're both beautiful.

301
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,301
They look just like the one
crapping in my office.

302
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,950
Did you tell Tracy
he could use the crew

303
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:29,008
to make a trailer
for his crazy movie?

304
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,663
Yes.
How's Floyd?

305
00:10:30,703 --> 00:10:31,765
What? he's fine.

306
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,167
You know,
I called him earlier.

307
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:34,712
We had a very nice chat--
did he mention that?

308
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,464
No, he didn't.
Oh, he will.

309
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,214
He's a good man,
the Floydster.

310
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,511
Oh, "the Floydster."

311
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,615
Don't give him a nickname
before I do.

312
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:44,217
Um...the white horse.

313
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,324
I was wondering if--

314
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,678
[whispering]
Did I hurt you?

315
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,379
Just a little bit,
but that's okay.

316
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:51,024
(Phoebe)
Yes, the white horse,
it's--

317
00:10:53,188 --> 00:10:54,286
Yo, Trey,
we got a problem.

318
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:56,289
Pray, who be this
Tracy Jordan

319
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:57,790
thou speakest of?

320
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,038
Uh, President Jefferson,
we got a problem.

321
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,334
Speakest.

322
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,897
That horse ate
your wig.

323
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:05,637
Well, stand guard
by his rump,

324
00:11:05,644 --> 00:11:07,496
and await it
in his droppings.

325
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,434
Or we could probably
just go get a new wig.

326
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,404
I like you, young man.

327
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,208
You shall run
my university.

328
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:16,749
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:11:16,754 --> 00:11:17,851
No, it's very nice.

330
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:19,757
Hey, what are you
doing here, Jack?

331
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,314
Jack bought me
this painting.

332
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:24,060
Wow. Um...

333
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,126
Is that lion eating
the horse?

334
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,661
Or perhaps it's eating
universal health care.

335
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:30,667
[laughter]

336
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,871
I bought this
for the Floydster

337
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:33,866
to congratulate him
on his promotion.

338
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,962
Well, it's not
a sure thing.

339
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,771
I didn't know you were up
for a promotion.

340
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:38,630
Well--

341
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:39,965
We should go
celebrate.

342
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,077
I'm free for lunch.

343
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,675
Do you want to grab
a burger, or--

344
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,528
Shoot, I just said
I'd go to lunch with Jack.

345
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:47,535
Oh.
Why don't you join us?

346
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:49,999
Would that be okay?

347
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:51,283
Yeah, I guess so.

348
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:52,284
Sure.

349
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,479
[nervous chuckle]

350
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,981
It's kind of like
you two are dating.

351
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,951
Um, I think that Coulter
was right about Edwards.

352
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,100
So where's Pete?

353
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,557
He took his kids
to that Russian cat circus.

354
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:09,862
Wow.

355
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:11,303
You are bringin' it.

356
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:12,364
[chuckles]

357
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:14,105
Yeah, you like that?

358
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,308
Mmm.
[Floyd laughing]

359
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,410
It's got pockets--
are you into that?

360
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:18,373
Ooh, what's this?

361
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,772
A used Kleenex.

362
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:22,009
I feel like
I'm in a rap video.

363
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,776
Wait, let me turn on
my humidifier.

364
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,278
Yeah.

365
00:12:25,317 --> 00:12:26,280
Uh-oh.

366
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:28,826
It's so dry in here.

367
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:30,684
I really don't know how much
more of this I can take.

368
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:31,685
[chuckles]

369
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:32,828
Unh, unh...

370
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,626
Unh, unh.
Yeah.

371
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,934
Old school,
Kid 'n Play.

372
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:36,932
Here we go.

373
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,133
That's not that impressive.

374
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,633
That's Davy Jones.

375
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:40,637
[cell phone beeps]

376
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,588
Hey, it's Jack.

377
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:43,296
Jack--
what does he want?

378
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:45,444
He's just saying hi.

379
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,034
Oh, he wants to meet
at that diner on 71st.

380
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:48,093
Get a veggie burger
and a milkshake.

381
00:12:48,096 --> 00:12:49,036
You wanna go?

382
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:50,247
It's midnight.

383
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:51,749
Yeah, we don't have
to go.

384
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,950
There, done.

385
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,146
Good,

386
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,353
'cause this VapoRub
isn't gonna get

387
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,352
under my nose
by itself.

[cell phone beeps]

389
00:13:01,108 --> 00:13:02,316
He says goodnight.

390
00:13:02,355 --> 00:13:03,661
[cell phone beeps]

391
00:13:03,718 --> 00:13:05,360
And "sleep tight."

392
00:13:05,363 --> 00:13:07,223
[cell phone beeps]
"And don't let the bed--"

393
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,612
All right, enough.
Gimme that.

394
00:13:08,616 --> 00:13:11,766
"Jack, I have taken
a sleeping pill

"because I have a big
lawyer meeting..."

396
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:16,429
That's what we call 'em.

397
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:17,775
"in the morning.

398
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,871
Floyd."

"Lemon, is that you?"

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,278
I always sign it Floydster.

[musical ring tone]

403
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,184
It's Jack!

404
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,490
Don't answer it.

405
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:39,691

00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:49,908
Can he see us?

412
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,811
The call is coming
from inside the house!

413
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,099
Turn of the lights
and get down.

[buzzing]

415
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:04,700
Jonathan, I want
to talk to Jack right now.

416
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,672
He's at Christie's.

417
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,311
But he left these
for you.

418
00:14:08,316 --> 00:14:09,417
What's this?

419
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,817
Tickets
for you and Floyd

420
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,118
for tonight's
Knicks game.

421
00:14:12,175 --> 00:14:13,577
For me and Floyd?

422
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,318
He tried to drop them off
at your house last night,

423
00:14:15,323 --> 00:14:18,215
but someone pretended
not to be home.

424
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,025
Oh.

425
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,589
This is really nice.

426
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:26,330
Yes, he seems very taken
with Floyd.

427
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:28,838
And you, of course.

428
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,403
Are these good seats?
Yeah.

429
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,051
It's actually
a private box.

430

Hey, guys.

433
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,808
Mr. Geiss, I know we disagreed
on my next movie project,

434
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:52,058
but I hope this will
change your mind.

435
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:54,625
I give you this.

Ah...

439
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:02,870
hoe that dirt.

440
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,073
Put your back
into it.

441
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,375
Mr. Jefferson,
the British have invaded.

442
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,378
Ah, bring me my horse!

443
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,881
Bring me Caractacus!

444
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:13,882
You come along.

445
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:15,990
(announcer)
In a world without hope...

446
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,987
[weak British accent]
Who are these Americans

447
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,841
with their ridiculous ideas

448
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,342
of freedom and equalities?

449
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:24,393
(announcer)
One man would declare
his independence

450

I'm with child.

What?

461
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,784
Free me and make me
your wife.

462
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,818
Um, I'll have to
get back to you on that.

Christmas, 2008.

472
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:15,841
Get me off
this horse.

473
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:17,612
[video off]

474
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:20,256
Well, Mr. Geiss,
what do you think?

475
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:22,557
Well, Tracy...

476
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:23,913
that was terrible.

477
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,067
The answer is no.

478
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:30,422
Let's talk about
Fat Bitch 2.

479
00:16:32,573 --> 00:16:34,362
So I'm bored,
and I sit next to Don Geiss,

480
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:35,532
and I want to make
a good impression,

481
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:36,677
so I bought four bottles

482
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,867
of absolutely
fantastic champagne.

483
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:40,079
Lemon, you're gonna love
this story.

484
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:41,182
You told me
this story, Jack.

485
00:16:41,238 --> 00:16:42,435
We're on our way
to Tokyo,

486
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:43,683
(Liz and Jack)
we're out over the ocean,

487
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:44,874
and the cabin pressure drops.

488
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,143
The masks are coming out
of the ceiling,

489
00:16:46,182 --> 00:16:48,483
and the corks are popping out
of the champagne.

490
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,047
And I don't give a damn
about the masks,

491
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,944
I'm on all fours
trying to shove the corks

492
00:16:51,987 --> 00:16:53,052
back in the bottle.

493
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:54,591
And Don Geiss says,

494
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:55,884
"Now, there's an executive

495
00:16:55,944 --> 00:16:58,657
who knows how
to keep his costs down!"

496
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,158
[laughter]

497
00:17:00,197 --> 00:17:02,061
That's great.

498
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,202
I'm gonna get
some more crab cakes.

499
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,010
Liz, you want anything?
No, thanks.

500
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:12,711
What are you doing?!

501
00:17:12,717 --> 00:17:15,714
I'm watching the ballgame
with you and the Floydster.

502
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,524
But don't you kind of feel
like a third wheel, Jack?

503
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:20,727
No, Lemon--
you'rethe third wheel.

504
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,976
Excuse me?

505
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,682
Well, it's really
quite simple.

506
00:17:23,722 --> 00:17:26,386
Men seek out the company
of other men they admire

507
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:27,727
and want to be like.

508
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,027
Floyd is me 20 years ago.

509
00:17:29,033 --> 00:17:30,422
I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago.

510
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,237
20 years from now,
Floyd will be me,

511
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:33,137
I'm gonna be Don Geiss,

512
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,241
and Don Geiss will
be dead.

513
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:36,040
Who thinks like that?

514
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,138
Men do.

515
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,639
That's why you're
the third wheel.

516
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,844
Just back off, okay?

517
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,904
Lemon, are you telling me
to stay away

518
00:17:42,934 --> 00:17:44,048
from your boyfriend?

519
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,348
Not that I blame you,
because I could

520
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,938
take him away from you
if I wanted to.

521
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,247
This is my life, Jack.

522
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,150
I know you're
in a bad spot right now.

523
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,444
But you can't use Floyd
to feel better about yourself.

524
00:17:52,503 --> 00:17:53,714
It's not fair.

525
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,114
All right, how about

526
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,756
some kind of a time-share
arrangement?

527
00:17:56,762 --> 00:17:58,057
You can have him Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday--

528
00:17:58,061 --> 00:17:59,918
I don't want Friday--
we have a show.

529
00:17:59,952 --> 00:18:02,020
Why am I even having
this conversation with you?!

530
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:03,520
Look at your life, Jack.
It's like this skybox.

531
00:18:03,566 --> 00:18:05,272
It's fancy
and it's empty,

532
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:08,276
and it smells
like crab cakes.

533
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,676
Get your own Floyd,

534
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,880
because this one
is taken.

535
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:17,378
Oh, outstanding.

536
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:19,580
Thank you.
Sure.

537
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,587
Sir?

538
00:18:24,593 --> 00:18:26,289
He said no.

539
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:28,949
Then he offered me
$7 million

540
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:31,047
to reprise my role
as Cocoa the dog.

541
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,593
? I'm gonna get
an iPhone ?

542
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,403
? Everybody's gonna
be jealous ?

543
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:36,705
No, I turned him down.

544
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,705
It's like a roller-coaster ride
of emotion in here.

545
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,663
Look, Thomas Jefferson made
his own country.

546
00:18:41,702 --> 00:18:43,164
I'm gonna make
my own movie.

547
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,412
Finance it myself,
all on my terms.

548
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,415
Now, who's with me?

549
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,566
We all are, sir.

550
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:48,912
Good, good, good.

551
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:50,504
Now, first order
of business,

552
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,373
get that dead horse
out of my car.

553
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:59,077
Well, I'm sorry your friend
wasn't pleased with the Stubbs.

554
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,186
Yes, so am I.

555
00:19:02,223 --> 00:19:04,080
You seem very preoccupied.

556
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:07,632
Well, it's just...

557
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,434
people don't like
fireworks anymore.

558
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,587
Were you aware of that?

559
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,933
They took away
the microwave division.

560
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:13,297
I'm having terrible
Lemon problems.

561
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,436
I'm eating all the time.

562
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,840
I mean, who needs
16 flautas after midnight?

563
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:18,201
Mr. Donaghy...

564
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:22,843
Jack.

565
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:25,652
Listen, if you're
still interested,

566
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,105
there is another piece
I'd like to show you

567
00:19:28,148 --> 00:19:29,755
that you might enjoy.

568
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:32,813
I'll need to take you back
to the private office.

569
00:19:32,854 --> 00:19:35,761
This piece
is very delicate.

570
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,158
Very few people
have handled it.

571
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:40,862
Oh, God,
I hope we're talking

572
00:19:40,867 --> 00:19:44,470
about the same thing.

573
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:47,476
May I speak with you?

574
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:48,776
If this is about
the other night,

575
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,125
I am not gonna apologize.

576
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:51,679
This whole Floyd thing--
No, no, no.

577
00:19:51,734 --> 00:19:53,235
You're absolutely right.

578
00:19:53,274 --> 00:19:54,627
I have to make some changes
in my life,

579
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,681
just like you have.

580
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:59,682
Phoebe and I are
seeing each other.

581
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,544
Really?

582
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,785
Wow, that's great.

583
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:06,348
Now you have a Floydster,
and I have a Floydster.

584
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:08,850
Well, I don't think
Phoebe would appreciate

585
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,501
being referred to
as a Floydster.

586
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:12,501
But you like her?
You approve?

587
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,195
Of what?
Of her for me.

588
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,758
Yeah, sure.

589
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,858
Good.

590
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:17,961
Hello, I'm Phoebe.

591
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,157
I don't know
if you remember me, but--

592
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,160
Yes, Phoebe,
I remember you.

593
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,204
Hi.

594
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,464
May I ask you something?

595
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:26,412
Uh, Phoebe,

596
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,162
I want you
to be my wife.

597
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,668
Wait, what?

598
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,719
[gasps]

599
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:32,819
Will you marry me?

600
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:33,876
[whispering]
No!

601
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:35,722
The ruby diamond cluster!

602
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,021
I bought it back
from the anonymous Arab.

603
00:20:38,027 --> 00:20:39,881
How romantic.

604
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:42,986
Ow.

605
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:46,535
Ow.
I'm sorry.

606
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:47,621
Okay.

607
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,437
Ow.
Oh, boy.

608
00:20:50,492 --> 00:20:52,534
(Phoebe)
Careful, my bones.
