2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,552
Excuse me.
There's a line, buddy.

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:11,512
There's two lines.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,389
No, no, there's one line.
We're in it.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:16,225
I'm just getting a hot dog.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,643
We're all getting hot dogs.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,437
What, you think
there's two lines
and we're all in this line--

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,856
you're the only genius
that got in the other line?

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,069
Can you believe this guy?
Don't line up behind him.

10
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:28,110
He cheated you.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,365
Hey, shut up.

12
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:30,579
What do you want
on yours, baby?

13
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:32,828
I want all the hot dogs,
please.

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,493
Yeah, I'm--I'm buying
all the hot dogs.

15
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,371
Oh, come on, lady.

16
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:41,453
And I'm giving them
to the good people.

17
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,040
Who's that?
Kicking it down the street

18
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:47,132
Causin' a stir.

19
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:49,921
Who's that?
I know that you're wondrin'

20
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:50,423
That's her

21
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:53,633
That's her, that's her,
that's her, that's her.

22
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:56,802
Who's got
the kind of charisma that

23
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,930
The boys prefer.

24
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,473
Who's hot
and you know that she knows it.

25
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:03,182
That's her.

26
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,272
She's like a summer sky.
It's like some cherry pie.

27
00:01:06,445 --> 00:01:08,480
And there is butterfly.

28
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:09,771
Me oh my.

29
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,363
Who flaunts her feminine magic.

30
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:14,243
That's her
That's me!

31
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,320
That's Pam!

32
00:01:15,498 --> 00:01:18,282
The overly-confident
morbidly obese woman.

33
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,081
This fat suit
smells like corn chips.

34
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,161
Going again, please.
Thank you.

35
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:25,212
And this is the set
of The Girlie Show.

36
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:28,881
It's a real fun
ladies' comedy show for ladies.

37
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:29,922
Hey, everybody.

38
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,801
Look, here's someone
you never get a chance to meet.

39
00:01:31,965 --> 00:01:37,012
It's the head writer
of The Girlie Show, Liz Lemon!

40
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:44,140
The Girlie Show.
Hold on, I'll connect you.

41
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:45,931
- Hey.
- What's up?

42
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,272
Hey, have you looked
at that Cat Lady sketch?

43
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:48,692
It's still
seven minutes long.

44
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:49,772
Yikes, okay.

45
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,443
Oh, and Standards has a problem
with that Michael Jackson bit.

46
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:53,232
But why?

47
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,901
Apparently you can't say
he's got a vagina.

48
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,320
Oh, it's--fine, I'll just
take the whole thing out.

49
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,742
Hey, you gotta tell that NBC page
to take it down a notch.

50
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:01,450
Oh, you mean Ken?

51
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:03,373
Yeah, he just embarrassed me
in front of a whole tour group.

52
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,292
I'll talk to him.
What is this?

53
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:08,171
Ah, well, you know how I hate it
when people cheat or break rules?

54
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes, I do.

55
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:11,343
Well, I just spent
150 bucks on wieners.

56
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,053
Atta boy.

57
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:15,382
Chumley.

58
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:17,720
The beverage situation
around here is reprehensible.

59
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,472
Oh, good morning, sunshine.

60
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:25,472
Surely our massive conglomerate parent company
could spring for a samovar of coffee.

61
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,852
Yeah, or like
a big coffee dispenser.

62
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:29,810
That's what a samovar is.

63
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:33,482
Are there other black nerds,
or is it just you and Urkel?

64
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:36,243
Uh, Cerie, do you wanna
get some coffee?

65
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,110
No, thank you.

66
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,071
No?

67
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:40,912
Hey, Josh.

68
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,620
I need to change
your Michael Jackson thing.

69
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,792
Didn't you tell me you had
a Jay Leno impression?

70
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,332
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,791
Check it out.

72
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,331
So, uh, President Bush
is in the news again.

73
00:02:49,505 --> 00:02:50,671
Have you heard about this?

74
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:51,882
No, Jay Leno.

75
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:53,340
The host of the Tonight Show.

76
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,343
I thought that's what
I was doing.

77
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,841
So, uh, my wife Mavis and I like
to go shopping for old cars.

78
00:02:59,016 --> 00:02:59,511
You know?

79
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,181
No, no. Like Jay Leno.

80
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,140
Like, "Hey, here are
the headlines."

81
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:07,060
You ever--you ever notice
when you eat a lot of cheese, and you--

82
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,020
How is that different
from what I was doing, though?

83
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:13,112
And I don't think you need to
introduce the writers to the tour group.

84
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:14,311
I agree.

85
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,113
I thought they would find it interesting,
but they really did not.

86
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:19,740
Well, Kenneth,
just respect their privacy.

87
00:03:19,905 --> 00:03:21,282
I promise I'll do better,
Mr. Hornberger.

88
00:03:21,457 --> 00:03:22,072
Sure you will.

89
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:26,241
I just--
I just love television so much.

90
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,040
We all do.

91
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,960
Liz, they want you and Pete
on the 50th floor.

92
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,870
Who, Gary?

93
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,381
Tell him I'll be up
in half an hour.

94
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,503
No, they said now.

95
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,630
If they got cookies up there, 
grab some.

96
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,213
Ooh, and get them to pay
for my Samovar.

97
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,343
Of course, I mean,
I assume that's what we're meeting about.

98
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:44,140
What about, uh, Ray Romano?
Can you do Ray?

99
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:47,473
Hey. God, oh. Debra.

100
00:03:47,646 --> 00:03:48,561
There you go.

101
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,891
My brother's tall.
Right?

102
00:03:52,066 --> 00:03:52,942
Are we in trouble
or something?

103
00:03:53,105 --> 00:03:55,063
No way.
Gary loves the show.

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,152
Pleased with the ratings.

105
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:01,200
Right.  Of course.
They love us.

106
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,290
Where's Gary?

107
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,581
Gary's dead.
I'm Jack Donaghy.

108
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:14,791
New VP of development
for NBC/GE/Universal/Kmart.

109
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:16,001
Oh, we own Kmart now.

110
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:20,460
No. So why are you dressed
like we do?

111
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,380
I'm surprised
you're renovating.

112
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,893
This is
such a nice office.

113
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,430
It's a great office, but sometimes,
you have to change things

114
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:32,312
that are perfectly good just to, uh,
make them your own.

115
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:34,902
Please.

116
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:37,861
Ah, I'll call her back.
Is she at the White House line?

117
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,361
Great.

118
00:04:39,536 --> 00:04:42,442
Tell them I need
a 4:00 a.m. tee off time.

119
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,531
Uh, five inches,
but it's thick.

120
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:51,250
Are you familiar with
the GE Tri-vection Oven?

121
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:52,793
I don't cook very much.

122
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:55,081
Sure, I got you.

123
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:58,091
New York, third wave feminist,
college educated.

124
00:04:58,255 --> 00:04:59,961
Single and pretending
to be happy about it.

125
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:02,593
Overscheduled, undersexed,
you buy any magazine

126
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:04,843
that says "Healthy body image"
on the cover.

127
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:09,641
And every two years,
you take up knitting for...

128
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:10,970
A week.

129
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,601
That is dead on!

130
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:14,353
What, are you gonna
guess my weight now?

131
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:15,812
You don't want me
to do that.

132
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:18,982
That knitting thing is uncanny.
How do you do that?

133
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,613
Market research, my friend.

134
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:25,530
Years and years of market research,
which lead to my greatest triumph.

135
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:28,283
The Tri-vection oven.

136
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, my wife
wants one of those.

137
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,621
Could we get Pete
an oven, please?

138
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:32,043
Hey.

139
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,081
The GE Tri-vection oven cooks
perfect food five times faster

140
00:05:35,255 --> 00:05:37,712
than a conventional oven,
because it uses three kinds of heat.

141
00:05:37,888 --> 00:05:40,250
Thermal  technology
for consistent temperature.

142
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:44,052
GE Precise Air convection technology
for optimal air circulation,

143
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,630
and microwave technology
for incredible speed.

144
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,525
With three kinds of heat,
you can cook a turkey in 22 minutes.

145
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:56,359
Wow.
That is impressive.

146
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:58,238
The people upstairs think so.

147
00:05:58,409 --> 00:05:59,310
That's why they promoted me.

148
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:02,190
That's why they sent me here
to retool your show.

149
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,731
Retool what now?

150
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,860
I'm the new vice president of
east coast television

151
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:08,113
and microwave oven programming.

152
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:12,163
That sounds like you program
microwave ovens.

153
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,041
I like you.

154
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:18,963
You have the boldness
of a much younger woman.

155
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:24,592
Lee, does my face
look bloated to you?

156
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,671
When I played that lady rapist
on Law & Order,

157
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,841
guess what the makeup guy
put on under my eyes

158
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,511
to take the puffiness out?

159
00:06:31,686 --> 00:06:34,681
Hemorrhoid cream.

160
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:38,440
Ms. Maroney?

161
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,061
I have the cat wrangler
here for you.

162
00:06:40,237 --> 00:06:42,813
Oh, is it that
horrible little--Hi.

163
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,781
Hey. Greta Johannsen.
It's short for "LaGreta."

164
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:47,903
Hi, great to see you again.

165
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:49,203
You too. I'm here
to introduce you

166
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,370
to feline actors
you're gonna be working with tonight.

167
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:51,992
Okay.

168
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,450
This is Po-Po.
And this here is Captain Boots.

169
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,121
Hello.

170
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,410
Uh, would you describe yourself
as "cat competent?"

171
00:06:57,587 --> 00:07:00,872
Oh, yes. I love cats.
I used to have two cats.

172
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,793
But then I moved to this place
with hardwood floors,

173
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:06,591
so we had to
put them down.

174
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:08,723
I'm joking.

175
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,720
I've done several focus groups,
on this show,

176
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,891
and what I've gleaned--

177
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,272
The blonde, big-eyed girl
is popular with women and older gays.

178
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,893
Jenna, that's
my friend Jenna.

179
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,482
And the kid with the funny hair
is liked by women,

180
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:25,730
but you're missing men
between 18 and 49.

181
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:28,283
I'm not missing them,
they're just not there.

182
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,200
I think I can fix that.

183
00:07:30,365 --> 00:07:34,831
So your job is, you take things
that are already working, and you fix them.

184
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:35,662
That's a great job.

185
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:36,912
Okay, let's--
Why don't we, um--

186
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,792
You're missing
that third kind of heat.

187
00:07:39,965 --> 00:07:42,081
I want you to think about
Tracy Jordan.

188
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:43,713
Okay--the black guy?

189
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:44,962
The black movie star.

190
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:47,340
I flew with him on a private jet
to the Super Bowl recently,

191
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,010
and I found him very entertaining.

192
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:52,511
Isn't he, um...
crazy?

193
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:55,221
Tracy's had his problems
in the last few years.

194
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,473
I am a Jedi!

195
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:59,641
I am a Jedi!

196
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:01,693
I am a Jedi!

197
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:05,311
The important thing to remember is,
he was never charged with a crime.

198
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,363
It's not illegal to fall asleep
on your neighbor's roof.

199
00:08:07,526 --> 00:08:08,613
Nor should it be.

200
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:12,572
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.

201
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:16,330
I don't know where we're gonna
find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.

202
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,293
I think I do.

203
00:08:20,795 --> 00:08:22,163
What are you doing?

204
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,923
Sometimes when I have
these stress dreams,

205
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:28,001
if I go to sleep in the dream,
I come out of it.

206
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:31,011
"This is not a dream."

207
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,132
Tracy Jordan is
in New York today, Liz.

208
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,181
I'd like you
to have lunch with him.

209
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,052
We have a show tonight,
Mr. Donaghy.

210
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,721
I don't know if your research
covered this,

211
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:41,390
but we do a dress rehearsal,
and then a live show.

212
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,271
That's  tonight.
This is lunch.

213
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:46,403
If it's not a good fit,
I'll drop the whole thing.

214
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:49,073
If I meet with Tracy Jordan,
and we mutually agree

215
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,531
that this is the worst idea ever,
you'll back off?

216
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:56,573
I'm known
for being reasonable.

217
00:08:57,917 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay.

218
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:00,371
Alfredo, 2:00 p.m.

219
00:09:00,547 --> 00:09:01,872
I'm not dressed for that.

220
00:09:02,045 --> 00:09:03,040
You're dressed
for Burger King.

221
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:06,960
Should we make it
Burger King?

222
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:07,840
Pete, hang back for me.

223
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,841
Yeah, you bet.

224
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,930
Hey.
What happened to your head?

225
00:09:20,107 --> 00:09:21,561
Uh, the sky is falling.

226
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,891
Do you have a pair
of dress pants

227
00:09:23,065 --> 00:09:25,522
or a skirt or something
I could borrow?

228
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:26,521
Thank you, Lee.

229
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:27,232
Whatever.

230
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:29,062
Hey, you know
in that Cat Lady sketch?

231
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:30,652
Do I have to hold
a real cat?

232
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:33,030
Cat Lady sketch?
That thing's gonna get cut.

233
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,113
Oh, good.

234
00:09:35,286 --> 00:09:36,911
Who's that?

235
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,621
That is
the new network dude.

236
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,740
Mmm, yummers.

237
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,873
He reminds me of Scotty
on General Hospital.

238
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:45,212
What? No, ew, Jenna.
Do not like that man.

239
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,881
That is a bad man.
God, you have a gift.

240
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:52,461
Laura Bush
is your size.

241
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:01,260
Hi, uh, what are you
doing down here?

242
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,313
I'm known for being
hands-on.

243
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:04,523
Clearly.

244
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,771
That's how you should dress
for work, by the way.

245
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:11,573
Yeah, if I was president
of the Philippines.

246
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:15,820
Afghanistan is a different
situation...

247
00:10:15,996 --> 00:10:17,200
I'll have an apple juice.

248
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,953
Oh, we don't have
apple juice, sir.

249
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:23,082
Then I'll take
a vodka and tonic.

250
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,123
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon. 

251
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:28,423
I know who you are.

252
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:33,670
I thought there was a...
strict dress code at this place.

253
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,633
I do recommend
the pumpkin ravioli.

254
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:38,682
They're very subtle.

255
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:41,763
So, Tracy, this Jack Donaghy guy
wanted me

256
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:44,472
to talk to you about
joining the cast of our show.

257
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:46,061
And I don't know
how you feel about that--

258
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:49,060
Lemme ask you a question.
Everybody at this table.

259
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:51,361
Did  he just say the word
"pumpkin" to me?

260
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,940
Yes, um, pumpkin ravioli.

261
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,900
Yo! I'm buggin'.

262
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:58,451
I can't do this.
I cannot eat here.

263
00:10:58,705 --> 00:10:59,321
I can't eat here.

264
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:04,791
I got to go someplace where they
make food that I like.

265
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,791
Lemon, let's go.

266
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,660
I will not work
with Tracy Jordan.

267
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:09,542
It's just a rumor.

268
00:11:09,717 --> 00:11:10,873
Have you seen
any of his movies?

269
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,040
The guy's sensibility
is just cretinous.

270
00:11:13,216 --> 00:11:15,753
I saw the one where he plays, like,
five different characters.

271
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,592
Yeah, Black Cop/White Cop.

272
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,970
No.

273
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,341
Who Dat Ninja?

274
00:11:20,515 --> 00:11:23,471
No, he-- He had to pretend
to be this old lady...

275
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,893
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Goodness gracious!

276
00:11:27,068 --> 00:11:28,521
You hooligans
better watch out.

277
00:11:28,685 --> 00:11:31,353
'Cause this honky grandma
be trippin'!

278
00:11:31,526 --> 00:11:32,272
Oh, yeah.

279
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:37,481
That movie was hilarious.
I saw it like five times.

280
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:41,613
Where's the love?

281
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:47,540
Right on, let me get two apple chickens
and some pecan waffles.

282
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,660
Nothing for me, I--

283
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:51,212
I had, like,
four hot dogs this morning.

284
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:52,712
Eat, Lemon.
Eat!

285
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:54,792
I hate skinny women.

286
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:58,302
Hey, Lorna.
Ten beers.

287
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,920
So, Tracy, we should talk
about the show.

288
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:03,341
Yeah, I ain't doing it
unless I can get to do it my way.

289
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,760
You know,
I want it to be raw.

290
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,391
HBO-style content.

291
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:08,432
Well, it's not HBO.
It's TV.

292
00:12:08,606 --> 00:12:10,392
And I don't think
that it's a good fit--

293
00:12:10,566 --> 00:12:12,730
You know, cause
I wanna drop truth bombs.

294
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:15,902
You know how pissed off I was
when Us Weekly said that I was on crack?

295
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,610
That's racism.
I'm not on crack.

296
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,191
I'm straight up
mentally ill!

297
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:21,152
Sure.

298
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:23,032
I got mental health issues.

299
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:27,742
Sure, well, you know...
Who doesn't, really?

300
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,413
Hey, has anyone seen Liz?
Or Pete?

301
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:31,371
She went out.

302
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,292
Well, who's in charge
when they're not here?

303
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,422
I'm in charge.

304
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,253
Oh. Okay.

305
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:39,762
Um, well, I'm not sure
about this costume.

306
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:40,920
I think it's hot.

307
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,932
Thank you.
I'm Jenna, by the way.

308
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:49,141
Ms. Moroney, I got
the hemorrhoid cream you wanted.

309
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:52,981
It's for my face.

310
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:58,441
Well, wherever you're putting it,
I think it's working.

311
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:01,690
You know, I don't--
I don't think you'd like it.

312
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,691
'Cause we work
a lot of hours,

313
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,700
and it's live TV,
which is risky.

314
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,322
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I like risky.

315
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:07,911
See, me and you,
we play the game.

316
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,200
We know how to be
acceptable.

317
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:12,963
Hello, great meeting.
I drink coffee, please.

318
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,423
This show is our chance
to break the shackles.

319
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,792
'Cause the white dudes
want to see us fail.

320
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,003
What white dudes?

321
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:20,753
All of 'em.

322
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:24,340
Jack Donaghy, General Electric,
George Bush, Karl Robe.

323
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,223
Karl Robe, you say?

324
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:28,012
Affirmative action
was designed to keep women

325
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:30,012
and minorities in competition
with each other.

326
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:34,432
To distract us while white dudes inject AIDS
into our chicken nuggets.

327
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:36,482
That's a metaphor.

328
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:37,560
Sure.

329
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:41,782
You should tell that
to Us Weekly.

330
00:13:42,827 --> 00:13:43,242
Hey, Lemon.

331
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,322
You like karaoke?
I know a joint.

332
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:50,743
No, no, I--
I gotta wrap up this lunch meeting, Tracy.

333
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,700
I'll take you.
I'll take you.

334
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:57,082
I just gotta make
a quick stop first.

335
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,462
You know what, when people say
they need to make a quick stop,

336
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:06,132
they usually mean at the bank
or the store.

337
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:08,511
No, thank you.

338
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:11,263
You know what, this is for
computer classes.

339
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:13,220
Know why I should do
this TV show, Lemon?

340
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,730
I really don't.

341
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,060
To get you rich.

342
00:14:16,238 --> 00:14:17,390
'Cause you know
if I'm on that TV show,

343
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,691
it's gon' blow up.

344
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,903
How do you know
I'm not rich?

345
00:14:21,065 --> 00:14:22,903
Your teeth.

346
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:24,993
You got to think
like these strippers, Lemon.

347
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,781
They know the window of opportunity's
only open for a moment.

348
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,160
You gotta get in
when you're young.

349
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,873
Get the money
and get out.

350
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,532
Yeah, well,
I'm not a sex worker, Tracy.

351
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,870
I don't have sex
for a living.

352
00:14:34,048 --> 00:14:35,120
Neither do we.

353
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:39,082
Neither do they.
Yes, they do.

354
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:52,180
Where is my phone?

355
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,520
We are strong

356
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,321
No one can tell us
we're wrong

357
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:09,661
Searching our hearts
for so lo-ong

358
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,242
He's got charisma.

359
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:15,290
No, that's Charisma
over there.

360
00:15:17,507 --> 00:15:18,252
Girlie Show.

361
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,083
Ken, send me a car, okay?

362
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:21,582
What is your location?

363
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,632
Dark Sensations,
in the Bronx.

364
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:25,883
I wish you were here.

365
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:28,630
Mr. Donaghy does not get
us showbiz people.

366
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,303
Let me talk to Pete, okay?

367
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:32,890
Oh, Pete got fired this morning.

368
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:37,521
That's so weird
that you don't know that.

369
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:44,112
Jack Donaghy thinks
he's gonna come into my house

370
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,482
and mess with my show?

371
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,071
Hell no.

372
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,821
Jenna and I worked
for years to get this show.

373
00:15:49,997 --> 00:15:52,743
You know, I moved
from Chicago for this.

374
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:53,662
From Chicago?

375
00:15:53,825 --> 00:15:55,622
I was in
Scottie Pippen's wedding.

376
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:58,452
Now Donaghy is trying
to steal it from us.

377
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:02,370
He already fired Pete,
who is a great producer.

378
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,791
He fired Pete?
He can't fire Pete.

379
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:07,050
You know what, I quit.
He can suck it.

380
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:08,382
Mm-hmm. 

381
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:10,263
Yeah, suck it, Pete.

382
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:14,223
No, you're not listening.
You're not a good listener.

383
00:16:14,397 --> 00:16:15,551
20 minutes to air.

384
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,471
But Liz said we were cutting
the cat lady sketch.

385
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:18,521
She said it stinks.

386
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:19,021
Ouch.

387
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,600
This is why Liz is wrong.
Animal humour is universal.

388
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,653
I  just don't think
that I'm good in it.

389
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:25,903
Do you think
I'm good in it?

390
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:29,031
I think this is your opportunity to go out there
and prove everybody wrong.

391
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:30,781
What--what do you mean?
Who's everybody?

392
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:32,201
The network that wanted
to fire you,

393
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,363
the focus groups that said
you had a weird eye--

394
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,200
You mean this eye?
Okay, this eye--

395
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,913
It doesn't open all the way
because when I was little, my sister peed in it.

396
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:42,001
Tonight is your opportunity to go out there
and change all of our minds.

397
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,291
What?
Where is Liz?

398
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:49,051
Liz?!

399
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,733
Four minutes to air.
That's four minutes to air.

400
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:03,442
Is Liz back yet?

401
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:06,191
No, which cat
do you want Jenna to carry?

402
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:06,693
I'm sorry?

403
00:17:06,865 --> 00:17:07,942
Which cat?

404
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,363
Oh.

405
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:12,613
I want...that one.

406
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:16,281
Jack Donaghy to the control room,
please. Jack Donaghy.

407
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,201
Peanut's not an actor.

408
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:21,663
I just--I just
rescued him from a lab.

409
00:17:24,505 --> 00:17:26,080
Hey, Lemon,
I'll drop you off.

410
00:17:26,255 --> 00:17:28,922
Where do you live?

411
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:29,921
The studio.

412
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:31,383
I want you to drop me
at the studio.

413
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,843
I want to tell Donaghey
to his face that I quit.

414
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:35,633
And I want to do it
in front of the whole crew,

415
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:39,142
so that they know
he didn't fire me.

416
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:42,311
I wanna see that.

417
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:44,890
Gonna turn the lights
down low.

418
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:49,232
It's almost time
for the Girlie Show

419
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,691
Ooh, ooh, pull over.
Pull over here.

420
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:56,910
Tracy, I don't have time
for this.

421
00:17:59,957 --> 00:18:02,950
This is where I grew up.

422
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,960
This is the Jordan
family estate?

423
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,793
Wasn't no Jordan
family nothin'.

424
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,091
This is where I was
in foster care.

425
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,922
Oh. Sorry.

426
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:16,590
Me and two other dudes
and a girl with messed-up fingers.

427
00:18:16,766 --> 00:18:20,642
I'm so lucky
I got out of here.

428
00:18:21,436 --> 00:18:23,353
It's not luck,
I mean...

429
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:28,852
You got out of here because you're
very talented, and... people love you, and...

430
00:18:29,027 --> 00:18:31,943
Are you peeing?

431
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,202
Where's Donaghy?
I wanna talk to him right now.

432
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:41,203
Last time I saw him,
he was riding a crane camera.

433
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:44,622
Oh, I have Pete for you.

434
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,121
Pete, oh, my God.
I didn't know.

435
00:18:46,295 --> 00:18:48,041
No, hey, listen.
It'll--it'll give me

436
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,832
a chance to spend more time
with my kids.

437
00:18:50,008 --> 00:18:51,503
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting right now.

438
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:52,543
No, no, no, no, no.

439
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,670
You have the best job
in New York.

440
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:57,051
Don't quit over this.
Don't buy all the hot dogs. Okay?

441
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:58,933
I don't want to do this
without you.

442
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:03,603
Hey, I thought we cut
the Cat Lady sketch.

443
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:07,600
We're two minutes short!

444
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:12,402
So, let me introduce myself.
My name is Lurleen Katz.

445
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,940
And these are my cats.

446
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:17,401
She's using a real cat?

447
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:18,860
I cast that cat myself.

448
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,373
And sir, while they are my--
Ow! Aaugh!

449
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:30,790
No, no, no, no, no.
He's okay.

450
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:33,091
I need you to talk
for two minutes.

451
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,042
About what?

452
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:35,381
Anything.

453
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:37,212
All right.

454
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:40,181
These cats are more
than just pets, sir.

455
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,593
Why, just this morning--

456
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,681
Excuse me!
Where is the manager?

457
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:50,063
I'm from the government,
and I'm here to inspect your chicken nuggets.

458
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,902
Uh-oh.
Look at Shorty.

459
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,942
This honky grandma
be trippin'.

460
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,072
What's up, America?

461
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:05,030
I'm coming
into your house live.

462
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:07,700
Lemme hear you say
"We love you, Tracy."

463
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:10,081
We love you, Tracy!

464
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:13,463
I am the third heat!

465
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,011
He's brilliant.

466
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:24,341
Are you drunk?

467
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:26,223
Yes.

468
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:27,220
Why did you fire Pete?

469
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:28,850
Why did you disappear
all night?

470
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,230
Is this some kind
of a power play?

471
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:31,271
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,312
It's not so fun being "hands on"
with these bloodsuckers, is it?

473
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:35,610
Could we talk about this
on Monday?

474
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:37,820
No. I want Pete back.

475
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,491
I want it in writing
that Jenna's job is safe,

476
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:45,372
and I want a cappuccino machine
for the writers' room.

477
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:46,582
Fine.

478
00:20:46,748 --> 00:20:47,700
I thought you were
going to quit.

479
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,791
Yeah, well, you don't know
everything about me.

480
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:53,211
You weigh 127 pounds.

481
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,880
Yeah.

482
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:07,262
Thank you,
good night.

483
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,520
You will be hearing
from Peanut's lawyer.

484
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,600
Good night,
sleep tight.

485
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:18,403
I can't wait to do this
with you every week.
