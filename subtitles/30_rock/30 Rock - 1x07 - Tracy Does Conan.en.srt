2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,508
Why is there hair everywhere?
Did you shave in the kitchen?

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,843
The water in here is softer.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,640
Look at this ski-jumping idiot, Bode Miller.
What kind of a fruity name is Bode?

5
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,601
That cereal has the Olympics on it?
It must be eight months old.

6
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:18,602
When you and me have kids,

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,938
we're gonna give them good names,
like Shannon or Rick.

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,314
When we what?

9
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:26,527
When we have kids,
dummy. Come on.

10
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,650
Yeah, I gotta go. Uh...

11
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,035
Are you gonna be home later?
I gotta talk to you about something.

12
00:00:34,205 --> 00:00:35,369
I'll be right here.

13
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:36,628
Look at this maze. It's so easy.

14
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:38,452
You have to go in here,
and out there.

15
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,792
Be home early, okay?

16
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:40,793
Come here, sweetheart.

17
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,912
Oh, Dennis.
I just did my hair.

18
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,920
Oh, that's my girl.

19
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,172
There you go.
Bye.

20
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:53,052
Now make sure you drink plenty of fluids,
and get something to eat.

21
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:57,223
Don't do anything strenuous tonight.
Don't hit the clubs.

22
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:00,353
No, I'm going straight home, actually.
I'm breaking up with my boyfriend tonight.

23
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,852
I can't take it anymore.

24
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,770
Hmm, 35, single,
no children.

25
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:08,020
Three sexual partners
in the last ten years.

26
00:01:08,198 --> 00:01:12,823
I don't know, doll.
Maybe it's time to settle.

27
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:16,950
Chocolate chip,
or butter crunch?

28
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:19,243
(Jenna) I can't believe
that this is happening to me.

29
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,532
It's just not fair.

30
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,331
(Pete) You're right.
This business is unfair.

31
00:01:23,506 --> 00:01:24,410
What happened?

32
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:26,212
Jenna was supposed to be
on the Conan show tonight, but...

33
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:27,582
I got bumped.

34
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:30,171
Oh, you know,
that kind of thing happens.

35
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:32,923
Jack bumped her
and put Tracy on instead.

36
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:35,340
Jenna, you can't let this
kind of thing get to you.

37
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:38,841
I just feel like everything
always gets taken away from me.

38
00:01:39,018 --> 00:01:41,513
No, that's not true.
What about that movie you did last summer?

39
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,103
"The Rural Juror"?

40
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,891
Yeah, The Rur--
That one.

41
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:51,442
Rural Juror, apple three, take one. Mark!
A terrible title. Action!

42
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:52,653
When does that come out?

43
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:56,450
"The Rural Juror" opens in
selected theaters December 18th.

44
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,321
Does Jack Donaghy even know
I'm in The Rural Juror?

45
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:02,740
Maybe if he knew I have a film career,
he would treat me with more respect.

46
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:03,793
/Jenna to the set, please.

47
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,411
/Jenna to the set for
/Rodney Stink Confirmed Bachelor.

48
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:08,251
I will tell him.

49
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:14,381
I will tell him that you are
in a feature film called The Rrr Jrr.

50
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,470
What the hell's her movie called?

51
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,013
I don't know.

52
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:21,473
She's been talking
about it for a year.

53
00:02:21,645 --> 00:02:22,890
I can't ask her now.

54
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:24,933
I can't believe Jack did this to her.

55
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:27,141
I can't believe Conan's gonna have
Tracy on as a guest again,

56
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:28,770
considering what happened
the last time.

57
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:30,101
You seem like you have
a nice chemistry...

58
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,863
I am a stabbing robot.
I will stab you.

59
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,570
Oh, jeez. All right, no, okay.

60
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,322
All right, all right.
That's great, Tracy.

61
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,701
We'll take a break.
We'll be right back.

62
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,953
Hey, Clariss,
can I see Josh's Stone Phillips wig?

63
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,571
Oh, great.

64
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,203
Do you mind if
I pop it on you, actually?

65
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:45,411
I want to see the shape of it.

66
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:48,120
Please, it would make
my wife's dream come true.

67
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,830
Oh. Yeah?

68
00:02:51,426 --> 00:02:51,712
Handsome?

69
00:02:51,886 --> 00:02:52,382
Yes.

70
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,211
- You find me handsome?
- Yes, very much.

71
00:02:54,386 --> 00:02:57,923
You know,
I used to be very rich.

72
00:02:58,096 --> 00:02:59,302
Hello.

73
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,223
Oh, hi. Sorry.

74
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:04,723
I know you're wearing that as a joke,
but it makes you look younger,

75
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:09,232
and more confident,
and I think you should consider it.

76
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:10,561
Can I see you in my office?

77
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:13,362
Yeah, hang on a second, actually.

78
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:15,320
Why did you bump Jenna from Conan?

79
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,903
Because if I have a choice
between an international movie star,

80
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,702
and a woman who does
commercials for ShopRite--

81
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:20,202
No, no, no.

82
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:23,240
Jenna doesn't do those commercials anymore.
She got fired.

83
00:03:23,418 --> 00:03:26,121
I don't do these things
just to drive you crazy, Lemon.

84
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,160
I do them for
the good of the show.

85
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:31,423
I'm the one that always has to
clean up the mess afterwards.

86
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,963
That's why my job is
way better than yours.

87
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,843
/Way better.

88
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:01,490
Conan.

89
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,411
Tracy's really excited
to be back on your show.

90
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:05,160
I don't know, Jack.

91
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,703
He's kind of a loose cannon,
and I like to surround myself

92
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,452
with people that
don't try to stab me.

93
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,961
Tracy's feeling a lot better now.
He's under a doctor's care.

94
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:15,923
That's what they said about Hasselhoff,
then he tried to make out with me
during a commercial break.

95
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:18,051
Conan, this is important to me. 

96
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,921
So we can either do this the easy way,
or the hard way.

97
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,090
What's the hard way?

98
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:27,350
You do a live Christmas Eve special
from Kabul every year until
the war on terror is won.

99
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:32,023
Tell Tracy I'll see him tonight.
You, black Irish bastard.

100
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:34,310
Back at you, man.

101
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:37,060
I have to be charming on Conan tonight.

102
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,032
This is my chance to redeem myself
with mainstream America.

103
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:44,570
Okay, well just tell us some things about your life,
and we'll try to punch it up and make it talk show-worthy.

104
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,160
Maybe something about you and your wife.

105
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,163
Me  and my wife like to play "rape."
She go in the bathroom and do her hair.

106
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,662
- Then I put on a ski mask...
- Okay, not that.

107
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:53,832
Hey, uh, you got anything
about being a dad?

108
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:55,371
People eat that garbage up.

109
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,383
I like to walk around my house naked,
to remind my oldest son

110
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,883
who's still got
the biggest ding dong.

111
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,133
No.

112
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,133
I can tell the story
of how I met Sharon Stone.

113
00:05:03,306 --> 00:05:04,051
Oh, what was that?

114
00:05:04,225 --> 00:05:06,263
I was pooping in the ladies' room
at the Ivy...

115
00:05:06,435 --> 00:05:08,600
No.

116
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,643
My hair hurts.

117
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:14,181
Anybody gonna answer the phone?

118
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,232
What phone?

119
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,441
Is anybody gonna
answer the phone? The phone!

120
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:22,113
It's ringing!
Ring! Ring!

121
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:23,862
So you wanted to see me?

122
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:24,993
Oh, Lemon, wonderful.

123
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,952
I'm introducing Jack Welch
with a dinner at the Waldorf.

124
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:30,451
What's a funny little quip
I could open with?

125
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:32,333
That's why you called me up here?

126
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,160
Okay.

127
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:34,713
Uh... "Good evening.

128
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,620
It's great to be here
at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria.

129
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,963
"I haven't seen this many
white people in tuxedoes since the Titanic."

130
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:46,803
Lemon, this is not open mike night
at the Bryn Mawr student union.

131
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:49,471
This is a $1,000
a plate fund raiser.

132
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:51,760
Okay, uh...
How about,

133
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:53,972
"Wow, $1,000 a plate.

134
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:58,483
"For that kind of money this stuffed
chicken breast better paint my house."

135
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:01,611
Let me tell you what
I was thinking of saying.

136
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:06,150
"Jack Welch has such unparalleled management skills,
they named Welch's grape juice after him.

137
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:10,491
"Because he squeezes the sweetest juice
out of his workers' mind grapes."

138
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,912
That doesn't even make sense.

139
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,541
No, it doesn't, does it?
I wrote it down in the middle of the night.

140
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,790
Listen, I'll try to come up with something for you,
but I gotta get back downstairs.

141
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,252
Lizzie  needs help.

142
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:22,250
Cookie in the middle of the day?

143
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,880
I gave blood.

144
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,765
Does that burn calories?

145
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:27,729
What else?

146
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,898
What else is on my mind grapes?

147
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:35,312
I could talk about how the moon is a spy satellite
put there by Oprah and minister Farrakhan.

148
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,692
And not the minister
Farrakhan you're thinking of.

149
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:42,153
Who's that dude?

150
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:44,860
Uh, what dude?

151
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:49,403
The blue dude.
Tell him to stop staring at me.

152
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:54,410
I don't like that dude.
I don't like that dude.

153
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:57,832
Meep.

154
00:07:01,176 --> 00:07:03,212
Hey, guys.

155
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,551
That was weird.

156
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:05,132
Hi.

157
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,923
You missed it.
Tracy was acting old-school bananas.

158
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:09,013
He's always bananas.

159
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,431
No, this was different.

160
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah. Like Conan-should-be-afraid different.

161
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:16,223
Really?
Where did he go?

162
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:20,520
Yes. I am having problems
with my cable television.

163
00:07:20,696 --> 00:07:23,692
Yes, I will hold.

164
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:30,451
Excuse me, I have another call.
Hi, mom. I am doing fine.

165
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,411
Oh, that's not good.
Frank, that was my blood cookie.

166
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:38,123
Ew, what?

167
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,253
Hey, Jack Attack.

168
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,753
Sorry, I should have kept
that one in the old brain box.

169
00:07:45,926 --> 00:07:47,632
Could you sign that for me, please?

170
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:50,381
Pete, where is your charisma?

171
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,092
What?

172
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,221
The wig.

173
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,392
I prefer that you wear it.

174
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,142
Well, I thought you were joking.

175
00:07:57,316 --> 00:07:59,682
Well, let me clarify:
I'm not joking.

176
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:03,021
Pete, did you know
that men with full heads of hair

177
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:06,730
on average earn 17% more
than their bald counterparts?

178
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:07,902
I did not know that.

179
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:10,153
Perhaps it's because
bald men are generally less informed

180
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,153
than men with full heads of hair.

181
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,201
But here's what I want you to do.
Wear the wig for a week.

182
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:17,083
And experience your full potential.

183
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,332
I think this is my full potential.

184
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:21,003
I know you're skeptical,
Pete, I know.

185
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,713
Here, I want you to do something.
Pull my hair.

186
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:27,883
Right now, go ahead.
Pull my hair.

187
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:31,723
I'm just kidding.
It's real.

188
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:35,552
I'm not like you.

189
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:36,802
So, be honest with me.
What did Jack say?

190
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:40,102
I guess he thinks
that Tracy is a movie star.

191
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:43,522
And he doesn't love it
that you did those commercials.

192
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:47,733
Well, you tell him that those commercials
paid for my vacation home.

193
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,442
So, unless he would like to buy me
a condo in Clearwater, Florida...

194
00:08:50,616 --> 00:08:52,690
Jenna, I'm sorry.
Just let it go.

195
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,911
Tracy's doing Conan tonight.

196
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,743
Liz Lemon, we got a problem.

197
00:09:05,175 --> 00:09:07,751
Grizz and Dotcom say Tracy's doctor
put him on some new medication.

198
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:09,462
I guess he's having
some sort of reaction.

199
00:09:09,637 --> 00:09:10,552
Boy, Conan tapes in...

200
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,552
Less than two hours.

201
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:15,092
Call me if you need me.

202
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,103
Tray? Can I come in?

203
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,902
I'm bugging out!
I'm bugging out.

204
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:32,033
I'm bugging out!

205
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:36,240
Tracy!

206
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:36,990
Who is your doctor?

207
00:09:37,165 --> 00:09:39,582
Dr. Spaceman!
Dr. Spaceman!

208
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,040
Oh, brother. Look around.
We have to find his medication.

209
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,832
Dr. Spaceman.
Dr. Spaceman.

210
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:51,750
Wow, Dr. Spaceman.
I owe you an apology, Tray.

211
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,133
This is Dr. Leo Spa-che-men.

212
00:09:55,305 --> 00:09:56,931
Hi,  I work with Tracy Jordan,
and I think he's having

213
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,262
a reaction to some of
the medication you put him on.

214
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,812
Ah, I was afraid this might happen.

215
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:07,272
You know, he's on so many different neuroleptics,
and tricyclics, that there's no telling how they'll mix.

216
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:08,982
But what can you do?

217
00:10:09,158 --> 00:10:10,980
Medicine's not a science.

218
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:13,110
What exactly are you treating him for?

219
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:16,073
/There's not really a name for what Tracy has.

220
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:21,452
Basically it's erratic tendencies, and delusions,
brought on by excessive notoriety.

221
00:10:21,628 --> 00:10:24,701
And certainly not helped
by my wildly experimental treatments.

222
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,372
Boy, I'm being awfully
open with you, miss.

223
00:10:27,547 --> 00:10:29,791
I should not have taken
those blue things.

224
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,082
So, is he dangerous?

225
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:36,762
/No, he should be fine, so long as you keep him
away from bright lights, loud music and crowds.

226
00:10:36,926 --> 00:10:39,183
I'll call in a prescription
for something to settle him down,

227
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,971
as soon as possible.

228
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:44,851
Uh...do you need anything for yourself?

229
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:45,561
What? No.

230
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:47,680
Just, where can I pick up Tracy's prescription?

231
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:50,983
Ms. Lemon, they need you upstairs
in Mr. Donaghy's office immediately.

232
00:10:51,157 --> 00:10:55,363
Kenneth, I need you to go to RiteDrug,
46th and 8th, pick up Tracy's medicine fast, okay?

233
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:58,071
Yes, sir.

234
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,620
What is it?
What's the emergency?

235
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,411
How's this for an opening line?

236
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,582
When I first met Jack Welch,
I thought he was such a great golfer,

237
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:13,591
he made Bob Darnell
look like Randy Barnes.

238
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,210
That's fine. Do that.

239
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,550
I don't know.

240
00:11:17,716 --> 00:11:20,011
Might be distasteful
if Randy's widow's in the audience.

241
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,012
What did you come up with?

242
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:24,050
I have a bigger problem, Jack.
I don't think Tracy's ready to do Conan.

243
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:27,563
I think you should let Jenna do it,
and maybe Tracy could do it in a couple of weeks.

244
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,390
Jenna's not a star.

245
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,021
She's capable,
but she's not a star.

246
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,730
She's got a movie coming out next month.

247
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:32,691
What movie?

248
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:35,441
"The Rrr Jrr."

249
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:36,323
The what?

250
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,530
Tracy's acting nuts. 

251
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,443
He's having problems with his medication.

252
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,573
Did you call Dr. Spa-che-men?

253
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,201
- Yeah, I did.
- Then he'll be fine.

254
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:48,751
Leo's an excellent physician.
And a pretty good dentist.

255
00:11:49,546 --> 00:11:52,122
Is that rehearsal?
Oh no--Oh!

256
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,710
No, this Tracy situation
is really...

257
00:11:53,886 --> 00:11:56,960
Are we still talking about that?
Do I have to come in and run your show?

258
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,880
Or could you take this one
thing off my plate?

259
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:00,880
No,  I got it.

260
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,433
I'll figure it out.

261
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:05,802
- What?
- Don't ask.

262
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:13,150
Who is this leader of men?
What can I do for you, handsome?

263
00:12:21,205 --> 00:12:21,783
Liz...

264
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,450
I wanted you to be the first to know.

265
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:26,282
After the way Jack treated me today,
I can't work here anymore. I quit.

266
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:28,120
Oh, Jenna, I really
don't have time for this.

267
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:31,162
Then, I guess this is goodbye.

268
00:12:31,337 --> 00:12:33,421
Okay. Jenna don't quit.

269
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,672
The show can't go on without you.

270
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,672
You're my muse, you're
a modern-day Lucille Ball.

271
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:37,712
You're prettier
than Deborah Messing.

272
00:12:37,886 --> 00:12:39,302
Please don't quit.

273
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:43,260
Well, if that's the way you feel,
I'll stay. Okay.

274
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:45,513
Oh, it's Dennis. Oh.

275
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:47,801
Do you have any food?
I'm getting really low blood sugar.

276
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:50,021
Are you dieting finally?
What are you doing?

277
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,563
South Beach,
Master Cleanse?

278
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:54,482
Hello?

279
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:56,902
Whoa, gimme, gimme. Shoo.

280
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,273
Liz, hey.
It's me, Dennis.

281
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,571
Dennis, what do you want?

282
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:00,572
(Dennis on the phone) Do me a huge favor.

283
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:01,821
Call Ticketmaster right away.

284
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,700
Nickleback just added another date, right?

285
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,621
I would do it on your computer,
but I'm downloading a game right now.

286
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:07,872
No, I can't do that for you.

287
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:10,202
Just be home tonight
when I get there, okay?

288
00:13:10,377 --> 00:13:12,123
I need to talk to you about something.

289
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,582
Word.

290
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:15,790
(Tracy) Blue man!

291
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:19,380
That blue dude keeps following me!

292
00:13:19,558 --> 00:13:21,763
Meek, eep.

293
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,131
All right, let's get him down
to Conan's hair and make-up

294
00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:28,052
and hopefully Kenneth
will be back any minute.

295
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,270
Oh, my.

296
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,533
(Tracy) No! No! Agh!

297
00:13:41,698 --> 00:13:44,112
No! No!

298
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:45,990
The blue man is runnin' up on me.

299
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:46,703
There's no blue man.

300
00:13:46,865 --> 00:13:51,541
I can't take the blue man.
I don't want the blue man.

301
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,621
All right, all right.

302
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:54,253
Hey, Liz.

303
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,330
What's up?

304
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:56,753
Oh, hi, Conan.
How are you?

305
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:57,833
Good.

306
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:00,090
You still going out
with that guy from the pager store?

307
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:02,423
Who, Dennis?

308
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,552
Yeah.

309
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,380
You still, um...

310
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,093
How's your wife?

311
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:10,392
Let's not do this, Elizabeth.

312
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,350
Okay.

313
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,643
(Tracy) Nyah, nyah, nyah.

314
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,062
Nah!

315
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:15,521
Vocal warm-ups.

316
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,191
I'll tell him you came by.

317
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,651
Okay.

318
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:32,952
Whoa, he licked all of those.

319
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,720
After you, ma'am.

320
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:54,722
(Liz) Chewbacca, may I
speak to Tracy, please?

321
00:14:54,898 --> 00:14:55,312
How's it going?

322
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:55,813
No!

323
00:14:55,975 --> 00:14:58,561
Past Pete is here
to kill Future Pete!

324
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,851
It's going great.

325
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,193
No!

326
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,822
(Liz) It's all right,
Tracy. Come back.

327
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:06,900
Yes, ma'am.

328
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:12,740
Do you have a prescription
[whispering] for Mr. Tracy Jordan?

329
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:17,793
(Liz) Come on out of there, buddy.

330
00:15:17,968 --> 00:15:19,372
Oh, I almost forgot.

331
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:21,290
Jack would like to see you
up in his office.

332
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:25,052
Oh, I don't have time for this.

333
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:27,880
Yes, Jonathan tell him
I've got my hands full with Tracy.

334
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:28,841
You sound upset.

335
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:30,011
(Liz) I am upset.

336
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:34,262
Come on up and
we'll talk about it.

337
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:49,403
Fine. I will try the other location.

338
00:15:49,577 --> 00:15:54,832
But frankly, LaDonica,
you have not been real helpful.

339
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,122
We'll get to your
problem in a minute.

340
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:04,250
Have you had a chance
to think of my zinger?

341
00:16:04,427 --> 00:16:09,421
"Well, it's almost Thanksgiving, everybody.
"And I know what this crowd's giving thanks for.

342
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:12,722
Estate tax reform."

343
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,600
That is terrific.
I really enjoyed that.

344
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:20,433
But, do you think it's too topical?
Damn, I wish this event were tonight.

345
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,152
It's not tonight?
When is it?

346
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,443
February.

347
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:27,901
Why are you wearing a tux?

348
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,280
It's after 6:00.
What am I, a farmer?

349
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,412
It's 6:00.

350
00:16:46,427 --> 00:16:48,921
You are right after
this commercial, Mr. Jordan.

351
00:16:49,098 --> 00:16:52,050
You can do this.

352
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,642
Mr. Blue man.

353
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:59,970
You're gonna tell me my feet stink?
You don't even have feet. Blue man!

354
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:01,730
Blue man, where your feet at?

355
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:06,063
(woman) This is home to Late Night
with Conan O'Brien.

356
00:17:06,237 --> 00:17:07,982
That's right.

357
00:17:08,158 --> 00:17:10,481
Now we are on the...

358
00:17:10,658 --> 00:17:11,740
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

359
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,150
This is a page coming through.

360
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:14,453
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:15,363
Let me just...

362
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,912
(Pete) Let him through!

363
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,881
No. Please.

364
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:34,593
Here it is!

365
00:17:34,768 --> 00:17:36,931
No.

366
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:40,642
Pete! I'm trying.

367
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:41,430
Give me his pills!

368
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:43,892
Here.

369
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,193
They're from Dr. Spaceman.

370
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:47,980
(Conan) ...my first guest tonight

371
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,691
from his numerous hit releases including

372
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,943
"President Homeboy"
and "Honky Grandma Be Tripping."

373
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,651
Or you may know him from
his last appearance on this show,

374
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:58,033
when he tried
to stab me in the face.

375
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,871
(Stage manager) Gotta go! Excuse me.

376
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,410
Tracy.

377
00:18:02,918 --> 00:18:07,083
(Conan) Please welcome Tracy Jordan.

378
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:15,421
You know, you really went above
and beyond for that guy today.

379
00:18:15,598 --> 00:18:19,512
I just hope we get away with it.

380
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,612
This is going on a little long. 

381
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:32,980
Don't, don't.
Don't do that.

382
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,112
Pants on. Pants on.

383
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:35,691
Sit in the chair, buddy.

384
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:36,950
Sit in the chair. Sit down.

385
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:37,783
Sit. Oh!

386
00:18:37,956 --> 00:18:40,492
Sit down!

387
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,000
That a boy.

388
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,040
(Conan)  Good to have you here.

389
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:52,540
That was great, and you're--

390
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:54,212
And he's asleep.

391
00:18:54,388 --> 00:18:58,512
Which...is okay, 'cause at least
he didn't murder me.

392
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:00,721
(Conan) We'll take a break, and...

393
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:02,183
Tracy Jordan, everybody!

394
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,310
Hey, you did good, kid.

395
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,272
Give me that.

396
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:18,493
I really gotta eat something.

397
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,040
I've lost track of it!

398
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:33,173
Hey.

399
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:35,883
Hey. What's up?

400
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:38,553
I didn't know what you wanted,
so I ordered you a cheeseburger.

401
00:19:38,726 --> 00:19:40,340
Oh, Dennis. Thank you.

402
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:44,303
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you so much.

403
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:46,812
So what did you want
to talk to me about, huh?

404
00:19:46,975 --> 00:19:49,520
Nothing. I forget.

405
00:19:49,695 --> 00:19:52,101
I just want to listen to you play Halo
'til I fall asleep.

406
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:52,862
Ah, that's baloney!

407
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,571
How did the grenade not kill him?

408
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:56,323
He was standing right next to it.

409
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,361
You know what, Liz?
This controller's defective.

410
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,782
Liz?

411
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:16,343
Well, I got started in
the NBC page program.

412
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:18,763
And before you know it,
I'm making hit movies

413
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:23,680
with my good friend,
and roommate, Zach Braff.

414
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,223
What?

415
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:27,350
Who told you that?

416
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,981
Well, yes.
I do know how to clog.

417
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,863
But I don't think anybody
wants to see me do that.

418
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,651
You do? Really?

419
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:40,112
Okay.

420
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:46,530
You're a weird guy, Kenneth.

421
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:50,500
See you tomorrow, Mr. O'Brien.
