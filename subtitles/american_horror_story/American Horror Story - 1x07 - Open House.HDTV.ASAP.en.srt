1
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:15,579
What... what did they say?

2
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:19,184
They're going to charge me
with criminal child neglect.

3
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,120
They're going to take him away.

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,959
Place him in an institution.

5
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,559
My boy.

6
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,261
My Beauregard.

7
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,333
Now, you know how he is.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,734
I know.

9
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:36,205
How he suffers so
when he's not with me.

10
00:00:36,273 --> 00:00:38,474
If you have any feelings
for me at all...

11
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:41,143
You know I love you.

12
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,944
I would do anything for you.

13
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:45,413
Then do it.

14
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,849
Like we discussed.

15
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,594
Beau?

16
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,832
You should be in bed.

17
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,149
Beau, you want to play.

18
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,428
It's too late for games, Beau.

19
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:34,663
Come on.

20
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,303
Time to sleep.

21
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:44,906
Perchance to dream.

22
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:48,512
For in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,715
Now, close your eyes.

24
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,655
God help me.

25

26
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:15,801
Are we having another tough day?

27
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,238
No, we're fine.

28
00:03:17,306 --> 00:03:19,039
Just eager to get the results.

29
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:20,741
Of course.
You must be very anxious.

30
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,043
You know, we want

31
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,711
to make sure everything's okay
with the baby.

32
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:24,979
You didn't see

33
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:27,148
anything unusual--

34
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:28,516
hooves or anything?

35
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,684
What?

36
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,052
Not at all.

37
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,221
And, Dr. Harmon,
that's not a ridiculous fear.

38
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,422
Every pregnant woman worries

39
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,325
they've got a little devil in them.

40
00:03:37,393 --> 00:03:39,661
Now, I don't want you to get
all worked up, Vivien.

41
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,062
You're having twins.

42
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,031
What?

43
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,232
Twins?

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,867
And they're both perfectly healthy.

45
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,770
Congratulations.

46
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,941
<i>The house is a classic</i>

47
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,476
<i>L.A. Victorian.</i>

48
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,379
These are real Tiffany fixtures.

49
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,947
Everything was meticulously restored

50
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,783
by a couple of the previous homos.

51
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,784
Owners.

52
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:05,652
Homeowners.

53
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,621
Fags have such a great eye
for detail, don't they?

54
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,056
A queer eye.

55
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,891
Let me show you the kitchen.

56
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,527
Please help yourself to nibbles.

57
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,129
I don't see you on the brochure.

58
00:04:17,196 --> 00:04:18,697
You come with the house?

59
00:04:18,764 --> 00:04:19,898
Uh, she does, actually.

60
00:04:19,965 --> 00:04:21,299
This is Moira.

61
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:23,767
She's worked for consecutive
owners of the house.

62
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:24,902
Uh, Vivien Harmon.

63
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,404
Mr. Escandarian
was in the neighborhood

64
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:29,874
to look at that gaudy
Mediterranean two blocks up.

65
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,909
It's about two-thirds
the size of this place,

66
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,678
and they want almost twice as much.

67
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:36,114
Of course, the Mediterranean
has a swimming pool.

68
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:37,215
There's room for a pool here.

69
00:04:37,283 --> 00:04:38,850
I'll have to tear out that gazebo.

70
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,386
I think that's a fine idea.

71
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:43,822
A swimming pool would
be just the thing.

72
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,123
How deep would you make it?

73
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:47,125
Very deep.

74
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,394
Good.

75
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,762
I like it deep.

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,999
You'd have to dig up the entire yard.

77
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,135
Uh, Mr. Escandarian,

78
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:58,973
would you like to see
the rest of the house?

79
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,642
Actually, I just have one question:

80
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,144
what's wrong with this place?

81
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,046
The land alone is worth
as much as you're asking.

82
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:07,281
Mrs. Harmon
is a motivated seller.

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,249
Um, and I would

84
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,151
also like to be candid with you

85
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,685
that this house has a history

86
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,654
that find troubling.

87
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:18,158
The people who lived here before
died here, violently,

88
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:20,294
and apparently
they weren't the only ones.

89
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,429
So I just want to be
very straightforward with you

90
00:05:22,497 --> 00:05:24,297
about that, if you are
in fact interested.

91
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,298
I am interested.

92
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,533
If it looks like

93
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,068
you're going to get a serious offer

94
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:30,103
before you hear from me, let me know.

95
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,738
I'll be in touch.

96
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,774
I'll see
you to the door.

97
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:37,078
If you decide soon, you might
have your pool by summer.

98
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,717
Are you trying to crush my commission?

99
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,352
I'm trying to be honest, unlike you.

100
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,888
Why don't we just include
a ticket for the Murder Tour

101
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,023
along with the goddamn flyer?

102
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,257
That's a really good idea.

103
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:49,992
Because you know what?
I think it would be

104
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,193
really good for us to know

105
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:51,994
exactly what happened in this house.

106
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,830
What is that?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,434
Excuse me.

108
00:05:58,501 --> 00:06:01,870
Ah. This where
the open house is?

109
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,106
Yes.

110
00:06:04,174 --> 00:06:06,374
Ah, what a lovely spread.

111
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:08,110
The open house is over.

112
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:09,378
Says from 2:00 to 6:00.

113
00:06:09,445 --> 00:06:11,546
It's only 4:00 now.

114
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:12,680
It's by appointment only.

115
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:15,983
Oh. I see.

116
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,751
It's because of my
affliction, isn't it?

117
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:20,721
Sometimes I wonder, if
I knew how much I was

118
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:22,789
going to be shunned, if
I would have run back

119
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:25,425
onto that burning school bus
to save those children.

120
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:28,095
Now this crudité is
making my mouth dry.

121
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:31,431
I'm going to have a little
glass of this Chardonnay,

122
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:34,634
and then you may show me the house.

123
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:36,336
Put down the stemware.

124
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,204
What are you doing?

125
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,672
A woman in my line can't be

126
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,940
too careful.

127
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:42,708
There are a lot of minority men
in this city

128
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,842
who would like nothing more

129
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,377
than to ravage me on this counter top.

130
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:46,378
Get out.

131
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:47,679
Put the gun down, Marcy.

132
00:06:47,747 --> 00:06:49,415
I don't like guns.
Put the gun down.

133
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,649
Yes, Marcy. I hope
you're permitted for that,

134
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:51,717
as I will be

135
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,118
mentioning it in my lawsuit.

136
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:54,887
What you're doing
is in direct violation

137
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,190
of The Americans
with Disabilities Act.

138
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,628
And this is the library.

139
00:07:01,696 --> 00:07:04,031
Oh.

140
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:07,267
Oh... that's...

141
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:09,370
that's quite a fireplace.

142
00:07:09,437 --> 00:07:11,638
I'm very interested in that fireplace.

143
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:13,306
Does it work?
Yes, it's gas.

144
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,108
May I see?
Yeah.

145
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:16,810
I'll turn it on for you.

146
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:19,746
Oh. Okay.

147
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,352
Wonderful.

148
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,422
Wonderful.

149
00:07:31,092 --> 00:07:32,059
Yes.

150
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:33,260
I'm very interested

151
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,294
in this house.

152
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:35,896
Although I'm not sure about

153
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:36,897
the wallpaper.

154
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:37,998
I find that rice paper

155
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,166
very cheap.

156
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,736
You know what would
look great in here?

157
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,897
A mural.

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,240
Yeah.

159
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,389
♪ I want a little sugar
in my bowl... ♪

160
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:11,599
♪ I want a little sweetness

161
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:17,273

00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,380

♪ I want a little steam
on my clothes... ♪

165
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,044
Stop it!

166
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:58,712
Let me see that.

167
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,651
Gross.
You're right.

168
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:04,819
It is.

169
00:09:04,886 --> 00:09:06,554
You mutilating yourself.

170
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,021
You do it.
Not anymore.

171
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,490
Promise me

172
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:11,825
you'll never cut yourself again.

173
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,267
I promise.

174
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:23,771
They planned some brutal
family dinner for tonight.

175
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,707
Like it's going to make me
feel better.

176
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,545
Do you believe in ghosts?

177
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,114
Why are you asking me?

178
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:34,415
I don't know.

179
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:36,217
It can't all be shit, right?

180
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,554
There's got to be someplace better,

181
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:41,155
somewhere.

182
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:43,258
For people like you, at least.

183
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:44,692
Not you?

184
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,129
Ever since you got here,
this is the better place.

185
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,672
You're not eating anything.

186
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm not hungry.

187
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,408
Pretty stuffed on bullshit.

188
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,643
Your mother and I
know that you're upset.

189
00:10:02,711 --> 00:10:04,745
Maybe there's some things
you want to talk about.

190
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,780
Like who I'm going to live with
after you get divorced?

191
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:07,747
Is there a third option?

192
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,316
'Cause both of you

193
00:10:09,383 --> 00:10:11,151
kind of make me want to kill myself.

194
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,720
Is that what you guys are afraid of?

195
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:14,789
Why else would you want to try

196
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:15,957
to actually deal with the problem?

197
00:10:16,024 --> 00:10:17,759
You never leave your room.

198
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,394
You barely eat.

199
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,864
These are textbook signs
of depression.

200
00:10:21,932 --> 00:10:23,266
We're very concerned, Vi.

201
00:10:27,738 --> 00:10:30,641
Look, you guys drag me
all the way out here

202
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,075
to save our family,

203
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,810
then you decide to break up.

204
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:36,781
You buy a house that I actually
like, then you're telling me

205
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,584
you're selling it, without even
asking me what I want.

206
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,087
So, fine, I'm depressed.

207
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,756
But I'm not going to off myself.

208
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:46,325
So, you can go back to
your policy of benign neglect.

209
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:51,631
Maybe we should stop trying
to sell this place.

210
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:52,932
I don't know.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
I mean, was that
so much worse than usual?

212
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,669
Given the circumstances.

213
00:10:56,737 --> 00:11:00,306
We need to stay on her,
but we are selling this house.

214
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:02,609
If that's, if that's even possible.

215
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,811
We have two prospective buyers.

216
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,380
One guy who's Persian, I think.

217
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,214
And the other?

218
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,617
The other guys has this

219
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:13,185
really badly burned face;
I felt terrible for him.

220
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:15,388
And I'm going on
the Murder House Tour with Marcy

221
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:17,122
so that I can get all the details

222
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,891
of what happened in this house

223
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,726
and give full disclosure
before anyone commits.

224
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:22,294
You're only required by law
to disclose anything

225
00:11:22,362 --> 00:11:23,728
that happened in the last three years.

226
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,597
I know. But I'm not knowingly
putting someone through

227
00:11:25,665 --> 00:11:26,631
what we've been through.

228
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,232
But you've got him on the hook.

229
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,368
You tell him about all
the insanity in this place,

230
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,502
you're gonna blow the sale.

231
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,537
It's the right thing to do.

232
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:34,172
The right thing to do is

233
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,976
to get out from under this mess,
so we can pick up the pieces,

234
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,711
so our daughter can.

235
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,513
It must be so great
to be able to do that,

236
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,814
to just flick a switch

237
00:11:41,882 --> 00:11:43,583
and be able to justify
your own bad behavior.

238
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:46,053
My family comes first.
Since when?

239
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,989
Do not screw up selling this house.

240
00:11:53,827 --> 00:11:54,794
Hello.

241
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:55,994
Moira is it?

242
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,796
How did I know you'd be back?

243
00:11:57,864 --> 00:12:00,999
I haven't been able to get
this house out of my mind.

244
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,034
Mrs. Harmon is out.

245
00:12:04,837 --> 00:12:08,739
But I'd be happy to show you
whatever you want to see.

246
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:19,050
As you can see,

247
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:22,954
this room belongs to
a sad, depressed teenager.

248
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,860
But it has real potential.

249
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,095
I'd paint it a deep, dark red,

250
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,597
clear out all the furniture

251
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:33,733
and hang a sex swing.

252
00:12:40,508 --> 00:12:41,842
My kind of girl.

253
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,911
It's always been a fantasy of mine

254
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:45,880
to swim naked in a heated pool...

255
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:49,884
when I'm not tending
to your needs, of course.

256
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,219
Somebody mentioned a pool.

257
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:52,787
I'm a little curious about you.

258
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:02,330
I've always heard Persians have
big, thick cocks.

259
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:05,366
Something a girl can gnaw on.

260
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,370
Yeah, no teeth, though.

261
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,273
And I'm not Persian, by the way.

262
00:13:11,341 --> 00:13:12,407
I'm Armenian.

263
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:15,944
Oh! Oh, your hands are nice.

264
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,579
Oh! Not rough like most maids.

265
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,481
Believe me, Mr. Joe,

266
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,616
I'm not like any household help
you've known.

267
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:23,919
Yeah.
You'll never want to leave this house.

268
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,263
What are you doing in my
daughter's room?

269
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:37,398
And who's this?

270
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:38,965
Dr. Harmon,

271
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:40,601
meet Mr. Joe Escandarian.

272
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:41,902
He's about to put an
offer on the house.

273
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:44,805
Oh, so great to meet you.

274
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:45,973
What are you doing here?

275
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,274
Oh, just picking up some clothes.

276
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:53,314
I can say, without any hesitation,

277
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,783
we've been very happy here;
it's a very special house.

278
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,451
Truthfully, it's all inventory to me.

279
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,527
I'm gonna bring in bulldozers,

280
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:00,221
turn it into units.

281
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,923
Great idea.

282
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:14,282
Hello, Larry.

283
00:14:14,402 --> 00:14:15,219
Jesus!

284
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:18,873
Ben?

285
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:21,751
You scared me half to death.

286
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:26,690
It's unnerving to have
someone just show up

287
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:28,993
in your house, isn't it?
How'd you get in here?

288
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:32,130
It's amazing what 20 bucks will
buy you in this neighborhood.

289
00:14:32,197 --> 00:14:35,100
Uh-huh.
You came back to my house, Larry.

290
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:37,001
You bothered my wife.

291
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:39,337
It was an open house.
I'm an interested buyer.

292
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,506
And what are you gonna buy it with?

293
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:45,210
The thousand dollars you've been
trying to extort from me?

294
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:46,378
You're not buying anything.

295
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:47,479
You don't know everything about me.

296
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:49,414
I know you're a liar, Larry.

297
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:51,850
You never went to prison
for murdering your family.

298
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:53,352
I checked out your story.

299
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,421
You were in a burn ward for two years,

300
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:58,257
then you were institutionalized.

301
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,959
You lied about everything.

302
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,595
They're not lies.

303
00:15:02,663 --> 00:15:04,231
They did die in that house.

304
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:05,899
But you didn't kill them.

305
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:08,469
Just like you didn't kill Hayden.

306
00:15:08,537 --> 00:15:10,405
It's all been lies.

307
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,106
You know that not everything
has been a lie.

308
00:15:12,174 --> 00:15:15,043
You know that that house has power.

309
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,753
Nescafé?

310
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,121
It's true I tried

311
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,890
to scare you out of the house,

312
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,692
but I was only doing it
for your own good.

313
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,928
Right. The house is evil.
Now you want to buy it.

314
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:37,797
That's goddamn right!

315
00:15:37,864 --> 00:15:39,265
I need that house!

316
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:41,000
I need it!

317
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:45,404
That is the only place I have
any hope to ever be happy again.

318
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:49,008
With her.

319
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,715
I finally got the girls down.

320
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:58,150
Sit down, Lorraine.
We need to talk.

321
00:16:00,953 --> 00:16:03,989
There's only really one way
to say this--

322
00:16:04,056 --> 00:16:05,256
I've fallen in love
with somebody else.

323
00:16:05,324 --> 00:16:08,459
I didn't mean for it to happen.

324
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:09,727
Do I know her?

325
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,762
Constance, from next door.

326
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:15,065
She's very beautiful.

327
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:19,237
I suppose if I were a man,
I would love her, too.

328
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:22,841
Are you going to leave us?

329
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:25,210
Actually, I think that

330
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,180
you should take the girls

331
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,582
and go back to Ohio

332
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,251
and move in with your mother.

333
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,787
And I will provide for you always.

334
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:37,357
You're going to move her into my house?

335
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:38,458
It was her house before.

336
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,062
I can't live without her.

337
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:54,973
Lorraine?

338
00:17:00,113 --> 00:17:01,580
Lorraine?

339
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,552
Open this door! Are the girls
in there with you?!

340
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,920
Lorraine! Lorraine!

341
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:10,892
Oh!

342
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,928
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

343
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,836
Constance?

344
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:22,671
All this for Constance?

345
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,174
She's the most exciting woman
I've ever met.

346
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:26,909
I need that house, Ben.

347
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:31,382
We have a buyer, a real buyer
with real money.

348
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:34,819
And he's gonna pull the
whole goddamn thing down.

349
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:37,021
And after everything that's happened,

350
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,456
that can only be good.

351
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:40,958
No! No...

352
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,628
No, you can't let him do that.

353
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,596
I can and I will.

354
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,098
And as soon as I leave here,

355
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,334
I'm gonna report you to the police

356
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,702
and file a restraining order.

357
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,808
Game over.

358
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,181
<i>- On a foggy Sunday night,</i>
<i>- June 12, 1994,</i>

359
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,050
two people were viciously murdered

360
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,586
in front of this luxurious
Brentwood condo. The victims?

361
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:10,990
Nicole Brown Simpson
and her friend Ronald Goldman.

362
00:18:11,058 --> 00:18:12,358
The accused murderer?

363
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:15,161
Nicole's ex-husband--
Orenthal Jamales Simpson;

364
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,529
"O.J." to the world.

365
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:18,364
Although he was acquitted after
a lengthy trial,

366
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,633
O.J. will forever remain
suspect.

367
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:23,269
I'm so glad you brought me on
this tour, Vivien.

368
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:24,337
It's given me hope.

369
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:25,639
How?

370
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:28,141
No matter how gruesome
or horrible the murder,

371
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:31,211
you can always find somebody
out there who'll buy the house.

372
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,747
Next stop on our tour
of departed souls...

373
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,549
"Murder House."

374
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:37,917
And ladies and gentlemen, we have

375
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:39,519
a celebrity here on the bus today,

376
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,253
the current owner of Murder House.

377
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,223
You left us rather suddenly
on your last visit.

378
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,224
Well, I thought the story
was so great,

379
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,260
I wanted to come hear the rest of it.

380
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,862
Let's jump right in.
Murder House,

381
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,932
<i>built by Dr. Charles</i>
<i>and Nora Montgomery.</i>

382
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,901
<i>They lived there</i>
<i>with their son Thaddeus.</i>

383
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,170
<i>That is,</i> <i>until the baby was kidnapped</i>

384
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:03,840
<i>and found dismembered.</i>

385
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:05,409
If Mother could see me now...

386
00:19:09,246 --> 00:19:10,980
polishing my own silver...

387
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,056
Charles, look at me.

388
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:20,258
Oh, I wish I were a widow.

389
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,060
I certainly look the part.

390
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,531
I bought this dress
for my mother's funeral.

391
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,267
Who ever thought I'd
be wearing it again...

392
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,102
to bury my son.

393
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,071
That's not true.

394
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,385
Because of you and what you did,

395
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,256
we'll have to forego an open casket.

396
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,120
Nora, I'm trying
to tell you something.

397
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,280
There will be no funeral.

398
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,184
The baby is upstairs

399
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:51,154
and waiting for you in the nursery.

400
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,767
Thaddeus?

401
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:50,749
Oh!

402
00:20:56,857 --> 00:21:00,026
I was wrong about you, Charles.

403
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,662
You are a genius.

404
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,966
How long I've waited
to hear you say that.

405
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:11,170
All I wanted was to prove myself.

406
00:21:11,238 --> 00:21:14,341
How on earth did you do it?

407
00:21:14,408 --> 00:21:19,246
I used the beating heart
from one of our girls.

408
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:21,982
Amazing.

409
00:21:24,852 --> 00:21:27,553
Nora... where's the baby?

410
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:32,057
I thought he was hungry.

411
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,994
I tried to nurse him,

412
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,995
but it wasn't milk he was craving.

413
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,033
We're damned, Charles,

414
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,467
because of what we did

415
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,169
to those girls.

416
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,303
Those poor, innocent girls

417
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,971
and their babies.

418
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,807
That thing upstairs--
it's not human.

419
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,842
I tried to kill it.
No.

420
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,660
I tried.

421
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,478
I stabbed it with a letter opener,

422
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:54,453
but it clung to life, Charles.

423
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:58,082
No! I finally succeeded
at something!

424
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,636
We'll alert the media at once.

425
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:01,573
Hold a press conference.

426
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:04,265
You would do that? For me?
Of course.

427
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,825
I'm proud of you, Charles.

428
00:22:15,411 --> 00:22:18,678
You are a man, after all.

429
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,924
<i>Legend has it that</i>
<i>the ghost of Nora Montgomery</i>

430
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,673
<i>still haunts these very halls,</i>

431
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,496
<i>as does her beloved--</i>
<i>if mutilated-- toddler.</i>

432
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,527
The Montgomery murder-suicide

433
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:52,282
was only the first of many

434
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:54,851
to occur behind these bloody walls.

435
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,178
Let's not put that in the listing.

436
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:04,736
Agh... I've been taking
the B6, it's just...

437
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,204
it's not helping.

438
00:23:06,272 --> 00:23:07,872
And I'm fine when I'm at my house.

439
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,573
It's just when I leave
my house, I get so sick.

440
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:12,709
Maybe it's your body's way
of telling you to stay home.

441
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:14,229
I think I'm just worried

442
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:15,698
that there's something
wrong with these babies.

443
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,733
I really... I want to
take that CVS test.

444
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:19,536
You've already had the amnio.

445
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:22,039
I-It may not make you feel any better.
It'll make me feel better.

446
00:23:22,106 --> 00:23:24,007
I'd like to; let's
schedule it for this week.

447
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:25,909
That'd be great.
Okay.

448
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:27,511
Thank you.

449
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,851
Got your flowers.

450
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:41,724
They smelled of the gas station
where you bought them.

451
00:23:44,895 --> 00:23:47,429
Red roses?

452
00:23:47,497 --> 00:23:51,234
Could you be more of
a pathetic, cheap cliché?

453
00:23:53,804 --> 00:23:56,840
The card said to meet you
at "our" house?

454
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:01,112
This was never our house.

455
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,247
It was my house.

456
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:04,382
And then it was yours.

457
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,952
You've got something to tell me?

458
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,253
Then do it.

459
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,189
Up close and personal.

460
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:16,928
Oh...

461
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,729
Oh, I've seen you.

462
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:22,533
Skulking around outside.

463
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:25,335
Have you seen my new beau?

464
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:27,203
He's so handsome, isn't he?

465
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:28,938
Yes.

466
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:32,107
Come here.

467
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:33,876
I want to see your shame.

468
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,047
Come closer.

469
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:40,248
So I can get a good look at you.

470
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:49,090
I bet the kiddies scatter
like little buggies

471
00:24:49,158 --> 00:24:50,425
when you walk down the street.

472
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:54,229
I love you.

473
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,797
Ugh.

474
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:00,935
You're disgusting.

475
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,470
You're weak.

476
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,973
You let this place
get the better of you.

477
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,375
The house didn't do this to me.

478
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:10,176
You did this to me.

479
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:13,447
If I catch you peeping in
my windows one more time,

480
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,883
I'm going to send Travis out

481
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:19,588
to ruin the other half of your face.

482
00:25:19,655 --> 00:25:21,523
They're selling the house.

483
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,064
No matter.

484
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,934
I've told you...
no one can own this house.

485
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:31,936
No one ever will.
He's tearing it down.

486
00:25:32,004 --> 00:25:34,005
And then who knows what will happen

487
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:36,140
to all the ones who reside in here?

488
00:26:15,651 --> 00:26:16,718
Hello?

489
00:26:24,127 --> 00:26:25,060
Play!

490
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:29,265
You're scaring her.

491
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,267
Go away!

492
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,639
Violet, it's okay.

493
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:36,840
Calm down, okay?

494
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:46,985
I feel like I'm totally losing it.

495
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,520
They're from the past.

496
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:51,356
The ghosts of people who've died here.

497
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:54,225
They're appearing to you now
because you're evolved.

498
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,893
Don't be scared.

499
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:57,995
All you have to do is
tell them to go away.

500
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:00,030
And they will.

501
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,299
You really know your
way around this house.

502
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,234
I guess I do.

503
00:27:06,704 --> 00:27:08,471
I've been exploring after my sessions.

504
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,406
Don't tell your dad.

505
00:27:15,645 --> 00:27:18,080
Look at all this great shit I found.

506
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,510
And check this out.

507
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:26,990
I think gay porn is hot.

508
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,057
Totally.

509
00:27:38,187 --> 00:27:39,757
What's in the other box?

510
00:28:09,134 --> 00:28:10,935
Look what he did to me.

511
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:14,305
Go away!

512
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:34,390
Oh. Mr. Escandarian.

513
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,160
How nice of you to agree to see me.

514
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:40,964
You have such a lovely home.
It, um...

515
00:28:41,032 --> 00:28:42,734
Is this real crystal?
I don't know.

516
00:28:42,801 --> 00:28:45,537
How much do you want?
I beg your pardon?

517
00:28:45,604 --> 00:28:48,073
For your house. I get it.
I'm riding in on my white horse

518
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,941
to rescue those people
from their shithole.

519
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:51,443
Make me an offer.
I'm into it.

520
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:53,845
I can tear your house down
and put up a car port.

521
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:56,548
You know, I would love a drink.

522
00:28:56,616 --> 00:28:59,551
Double vodka, no ice.

523
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:05,090
You're not from California, are you?

524
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:06,358
I'm from Armenia.

525
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:09,728
My family moved to Beverly
Hills when I was two.

526
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:12,998
Used to be no one was from here.

527
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:16,168
People came here to
escape their pasts.

528
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:18,871
Find a plot of land that not even

529
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:21,641
a red Indian had set foot on

530
00:29:21,709 --> 00:29:23,910
and make a new life for yourself.

531
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,211
Give me a number.

532
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,080
I want history, I'll go
talk to Gene Autry.

533
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:31,919
But now there are
no more virgin plots.

534
00:29:31,987 --> 00:29:33,754
We live on top of each other.

535
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,857
That's California now...

536
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,527
and that's the world.

537
00:29:39,594 --> 00:29:44,398
There is no more space, and yet
it's human nature to want to

538
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:47,167
claim your own turf.

539
00:29:47,235 --> 00:29:48,535
So build away, we do.

540
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:51,605
Every time you put up

541
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:54,541
one of these...
monstrous temples

542
00:29:54,609 --> 00:29:57,177
to the gods of travertine,

543
00:29:57,245 --> 00:30:00,547
you're building on top of
someone else's life.

544
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:01,982
I'm a developer.

545
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,684
I improved on the past.

546
00:30:04,752 --> 00:30:06,119
I build a new future.

547
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:08,522
You should show some respect.

548
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,557
You're not an archeologist.

549
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:14,694
You should stop unearthing
while you're ahead.

550
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:17,097
It only brings a haunting.

551
00:30:17,165 --> 00:30:19,266
We have a responsibility

552
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:25,707
as caretakers to the old lands...

553
00:30:25,775 --> 00:30:27,942
to show some respect.

554
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,378
Cemeteries are for the past.

555
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:31,813
This is my time.

556
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:34,216
You can't tear down that house.

557
00:30:34,284 --> 00:30:37,286
If you want to keep it so bad, buy it.

558
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:39,554
Well, not all of us have
been as fortunate as you.

559
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,823
Then piss off!

560
00:30:41,891 --> 00:30:43,625
You come into my house and insult me,

561
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,059
and give me a history lesson,

562
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:46,894
and I'm supposed to back out of a deal

563
00:30:46,962 --> 00:30:48,395
that's going to make me millions?

564
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:50,898
There are three reasons
I deal with women:

565
00:30:50,966 --> 00:30:54,703
sex, money, or making me sandwiches.

566
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,905
And unless you're planning
on going into my kitchen

567
00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:59,308
and slapping some ham
between two slices of bread...

568
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:01,043
this conversation is over.

569
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:11,154
One day, your time's going to end.

570
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:14,391
And they'll be building
on top of you, too.

571
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:23,032
<i>You know, I really like</i>
<i>talking to you, Dr. Harmon.</i>

572
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,201
You've helped me a lot.

573
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,103
Maybe it's the drugs.

574
00:31:28,872 --> 00:31:30,606
I don't have any more visions.

575
00:31:30,674 --> 00:31:32,808
I think it might have
just been like a...

576
00:31:32,876 --> 00:31:35,412
like a screwy chemical imbalance.

577
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:38,381
And of course, the parenting.

578
00:31:38,449 --> 00:31:41,018
Well, I'm glad you feel
so much better, Tate.

579
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:42,286
I really am.

580
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:46,391
Our session's over for today.

581
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,797
Look, I, uh...

582
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:53,332
I need to ask you something.

583
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,766
Off the clock.

584
00:31:54,834 --> 00:31:58,237
And I have no right.
But... I'm desperate.

585
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:00,873
I'm worried about Violet.

586
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:04,510
I get that.

587
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:05,945
She's your daughter.

588
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:08,414
But, you know, she's not
a little girl anymore.

589
00:32:08,482 --> 00:32:10,216
And at some point...

590
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:12,385
you're gonna have to let her go.

591
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:13,787
She won't talk to me anymore.

592
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:16,323
We used to be very close.
She's been through a lot.

593
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,793
She talks to you.
I know she talks to you.

594
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,728
What I'm getting at, Tate, is

595
00:32:20,796 --> 00:32:24,066
if Violet is in trouble, real trouble,

596
00:32:24,134 --> 00:32:26,001
please come to me right away.

597
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,236
I don't want to lose her.

598
00:32:27,304 --> 00:32:28,871
I can't.

599
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:30,440
I wouldn't survive it.

600
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:32,675
I wish you were my father.

601
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,478
My life would have been
a lot different.

602
00:32:40,652 --> 00:32:43,053
What do you want?

603
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:44,797
I need to speak to my son.

604
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:47,610
I believe he had a session
with Dr. Harmon today.

605
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:48,664
That ended.

606
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:52,193
But I'm sure the little psycho is still
skulking around here somewhere.

607
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:55,232
You missed a spot.

608
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,068
So did you.

609
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:58,302
You've been crying.

610
00:32:59,663 --> 00:33:01,139
Good.

611
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:09,048
Tate?

612
00:33:11,785 --> 00:33:13,619
Tate, honey?

613
00:33:15,422 --> 00:33:16,789
What do you want?

614
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:20,398
Oh...

615
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:25,697
Well, I wanted to see you.

616
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:32,904
Are you feeling any better?

617
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,402
Are the visits with
the good doctor helping you?

618
00:33:40,522 --> 00:33:41,785
Yeah.

619
00:33:42,677 --> 00:33:44,445
We're really getting
to the root of the problem.

620
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:47,748
Turns out I hate my mother.

621
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:02,698
Beau?

622
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:04,800
Come here, darling.

623
00:34:04,868 --> 00:34:07,703
Sit down with me, darling.

624
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:14,443
My beautiful boy.

625
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,945
My handsome boy.

626
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,080
Mama's got to say good-bye.

627
00:34:23,393 --> 00:34:25,924
They're going to take you
away from me.

628
00:34:27,457 --> 00:34:32,161
They're going to take
everything away forever.

629
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:36,532
Oh.

630
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,768
My sweet boy.

631
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,772
It'll be okay.

632
00:34:47,248 --> 00:34:50,940
Well... you think you're being

633
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,948
very crafty, don't you?

634
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:56,518
Throwing yourself
at that greasy Persian.

635
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:58,754
But you've been too clever by half.

636
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:01,090
He says he's building me
a swimming pool.

637
00:35:01,157 --> 00:35:03,141
And when they dig up that backyard

638
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:05,614
and find my bones,
you'll go to prison.

639
00:35:05,734 --> 00:35:08,998
There's not going to be a
swimming pool, you stupid slut.

640
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,501
There won't even be a house.

641
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:14,981
He plans to tear the whole thing down

642
00:35:15,101 --> 00:35:17,741
and put up affordable housing.

643
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:21,780
He's going to seal your tomb for good.

644
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:22,815
I don't believe you.

645
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:24,350
Well, it's true.

646
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,851
He told me so himself.

647
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:28,560
And while I would normally

648
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:32,137
rejoice at the thought of you

649
00:35:32,205 --> 00:35:36,252
spending eternity
scrubbing out low-flow toilets

650
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:38,476
in government-
subsidized housing,

651
00:35:38,543 --> 00:35:43,750
there's every chance
that when these walls come down,

652
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,115
I am going to lose my family forever.

653
00:35:46,183 --> 00:35:48,468
And I won't have that.

654
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,812
He lied to me.

655
00:35:52,777 --> 00:35:55,396
Well, of course he lied to you.

656
00:35:56,146 --> 00:35:57,540
Why do they always lie?

657
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,728
It's in their nature.

658
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:00,630
They can't help it.

659
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:06,031
But we can help each other.

660
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,733
What do you want me to do?

661
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,338
What you do best.

662
00:36:23,149 --> 00:36:24,349
Sure nobody's home?

663
00:36:24,417 --> 00:36:27,419
They're upstairs, tucked in tight.

664
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,689
Ever since you called,

665
00:36:30,757 --> 00:36:35,226
all I can think about is
that sweet mouth of yours.

666
00:36:35,294 --> 00:36:38,762
I've had it all over the world, baby.

667
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:41,098
You're the best.

668
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,600
Lucky you--
I'm hungry again.

669
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,837
Let's go someplace
where no one can hear us.

670
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,408
Kind of dark down here.

671
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,811
Puts me in the mood to do bad things.

672
00:36:57,981 --> 00:36:59,148
Somebody's a little eager.
Uh-huh.

673
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:01,884
No more talk, baby.

674
00:37:08,424 --> 00:37:10,259
Ah...

675
00:37:10,327 --> 00:37:12,861
That is nice.

676
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:16,031
Little less teeth.

677
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:54,367
After all these years, Moira,

678
00:37:54,435 --> 00:37:56,937
I have finally come
to appreciate your talent.

679
00:37:58,105 --> 00:37:59,039
Is he dead yet?

680
00:37:59,106 --> 00:38:00,674
Not quite yet.

681
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:03,444
Well, make sure he's off
the property before he expire.

682
00:38:03,512 --> 00:38:04,913
I wouldn't care

683
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:07,449
to encounter his carcass ever again.

684
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,292
Can I come in?

685
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:22,663
So it looks like, uh...

686
00:38:22,731 --> 00:38:24,698
this guy's pretty serious
about buying the house.

687
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:27,768
I mean, we won't know
officially until it's

688
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:29,536
actually in escrow, but...

689
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,571
I wanted to talk to you about it.

690
00:38:34,142 --> 00:38:35,542
Well, then what?

691
00:38:36,711 --> 00:38:37,872
Then I think...

692
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:40,860
you and I will go stay
with your Aunt Jo

693
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,552
till we find a place.

694
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,221
What about Dad?

695
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,691
Well, Dad still has patients,

696
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,559
and...

697
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,588
I don't really know, sweetheart.

698
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,730
We haven't figured it all out yet.

699
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,768
This wasn't the way it
was supposed to go, honey.

700
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,706
Your dad and I
really loved each other.

701
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:04,776
How'd you know you loved him
when you first met?

702
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,414
Well, he was...

703
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:12,950
he was handsome and kind.

704
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,752
But I don't know.
The thing is,

705
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,322
when you fall in love,
it's kind of like you go crazy,

706
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,091
and before you know it,
the whole world looks different,

707
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:22,259
and then you'll do anything
for the other person.

708
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,095
Why do you ask?

709
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:28,466
No reason.

710
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,204
Look at this.

711
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,741
Wow.

712
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,344
That's the house.
Yeah.

713
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,879
When it was first built.

714
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,702
Where'd you find all this stuff?

715
00:39:43,822 --> 00:39:45,817
In the attic.

716
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,122
That's the original owners.

717
00:39:47,242 --> 00:39:49,554
Nora and Charles Montgomery.

718
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:52,223
Are you the woman of the house?

719
00:39:53,065 --> 00:39:55,126
Matches my eyes, doesn't it?

720
00:39:55,193 --> 00:40:00,384
