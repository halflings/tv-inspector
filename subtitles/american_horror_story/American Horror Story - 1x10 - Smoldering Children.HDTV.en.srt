1
00:00:00,677 --> 00:00:02,445
Ladies and gentlemen, the ham.

2
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:05,721
Ah...

3
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:07,083
Wow.

4
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:08,184
It looks lovely.

5
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,591
Now, who wants to say grace?

6
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:14,535
Oh, Mother, may I?

7
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:16,304
Oh, of course, son.

8
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:20,455
I was hoping you would choose
to become a part of this family.

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,883
Dear God, thank you for
this salty pig meat

10
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:30,419
we are about to eat, along with

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,096
the rest of the indigestible swill.

12
00:00:32,216 --> 00:00:34,018
And thank you for our
new charade of a family.

13
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:36,209
My father ran away
when I was only six.

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,861
If I'd have known any better,
I would have joined him.

15
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:39,875
And, also,

16
00:00:39,995 --> 00:00:41,481
because she's been trying to
get back into this house

17
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:43,664
ever since she lost it, Lord,

18
00:00:43,732 --> 00:00:45,533
a big thank you for blinding

19
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,770
the cocksucker that's doing my mother,

20
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,940
so that he can't see
what everybody knows.

21
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:52,275
She doesn't really love him.

22
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:54,878
Amen.

23
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,685
Now, Tate, I know that you've had

24
00:00:59,752 --> 00:01:01,052
a hard time making the adjustment,

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,489
with all the recent changes--
moving back in here

26
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:07,092
after the... the tragedy that
my own family went through...

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,760
They burned themselves alive

28
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,629
after you were cheating on your wife

29
00:01:10,697 --> 00:01:12,898
with Constance, Lawrence.

30
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:14,799
It was...
that was nobody's fault.

31
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,768
Passion drove her to it.

32
00:01:16,836 --> 00:01:18,336
One day, you'll understand.

33
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:23,274
There are sacrifices you have
to make in the name of love.

34
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:25,611
On a lighter note, I have reserved

35
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:30,016
tickets for everybody,
for Saturday, at our

36
00:01:30,084 --> 00:01:35,423
community theater, for the
opening night of <i>Brigadoon.</i>

37
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:39,161
I'm delighted to be
debuting in the chorus.

38
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:41,697
Well, I, for one,

39
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,465
shall be there with bells on.

40
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:47,102
Thank you, darling, for being
so supportive and encouraging.

41
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,737
You have allowed me to explore

42
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:51,106
another facet of my self.

43
00:01:51,173 --> 00:01:52,574
Yay, I love the theater!

44
00:01:52,642 --> 00:01:54,109
Don't, Addie!

45
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:56,512
You're a smart girl.
You know he killed our brother.

46
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,149
Stop it! Beau died in his
slumber, of natural causes.

47
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,753
Now, you know he had
a respiratory ailment.

48
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,356
Your brother's in a better place.

49
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:09,358
He suffered with every
breath that he took.

50
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:11,193
He only suffered because of you.

51
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,433
You know, Tate, unlike your siblings,

52
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:19,571
you were graced with so many gifts.

53
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:22,107
How is it that you can't
bring yourself to use them?

54
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,209
Just a smile,

55
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,512
or a kind word,

56
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,281
could open the gates to heaven.

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,454
No matter how much you want it...

58
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,959
...I will never be
your perfect son.

59
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:49,301
Tate, what are you doing here?

60
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,636
Shouldn't you be in school?

61
00:03:50,703 --> 00:03:51,971
I'm going right after.

62
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:53,105
After what?

63
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,311
Oh!

64
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,728
Oh, ah! Ah!

65
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:13,688

66
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,315
Hi.

67
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:21,184
How you doing?

68
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:25,360
Viv, I owe you a very big apology.

69
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,464
I don't want you to apologize.

70
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,967
I just want you to leave.

71
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,302
I've been doing a lot of thinking

72
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,537
while I've been in here.

73
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,572
I think you're the one that's crazy.

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,641
I really mean that.

75
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,245
Vivien...

76
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:45,334
I know you're telling the truth.

77
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:47,951
You were raped.

78
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,187
Oh...

79
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:55,693
Who, or-or what has brought
you to that conclusion?

80
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:58,495
Because...

81
00:05:58,563 --> 00:06:00,297
I know it wasn't anything that I said.

82
00:06:02,033 --> 00:06:03,867
Can I sit?

83
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:15,343
I was advised not to tell you this.

84
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,547
The psychiatrist and Dr. Hall

85
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:19,815
didn't think you were stable enough.

86
00:06:21,485 --> 00:06:23,252
The twins have different fathers.

87
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:26,189
One of the babies is not mine.

88
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:32,964
What?
It's a medical anomaly, but...

89
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,566
there have been cases.

90
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,303
Oh, God...

91
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:42,507
When I came to see you, I was...

92
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:44,908
I was convinced it was Luke,

93
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,476
that somehow you two...
Oh, God...

94
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:50,347
Vivien... I'm...

95
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:52,848
I'm so sorry about all this.

96
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,218
I really am.

97
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:57,986
Do you remember anything
about this guy,

98
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,089
other than the rubber suit?

99
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:02,758
His eyes, his voice...?

100
00:07:02,826 --> 00:07:06,228
He didn't speak, Ben.
Don't you think

101
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:09,098
that's all I've been thinking
about since I've been in here?

102
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,833
How did he get into our house?

103
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,035
Where were you?

104
00:07:12,103 --> 00:07:13,903
How did he get that suit?

105
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,339
I don't have any answers.

106
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:19,143
But we'll find them.

107
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,946
Together.

108
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:24,516
Now, I-I've spoken
to the psychiatrist,

109
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,519
and there are some...
legal hiccups to work out

110
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:28,788
because of the gunshot.

111
00:07:30,257 --> 00:07:32,025
But you'll be able to come home,

112
00:07:32,093 --> 00:07:33,927
in a day or two.

113
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,296
I promise.

114
00:07:36,364 --> 00:07:38,798
I'm not going back to that house.

115
00:07:43,104 --> 00:07:44,770
Constance Langdon?

116
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:46,406
Yes?

117
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:47,607
I'm Detective Granger,

118
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,508
this is Detective Barrios.

119
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,911
May we come in?

120
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,549
We know how upsetting

121
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:59,052
this must be for you,
Ms. Langdon.

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,088
If you could just confirm
for us that that is

123
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,489
Travis Wanderly...

124
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,261
Yes, it's him.

125
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:09,831
Look at that face.

126
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:13,435
That beautiful, beautiful face.

127
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:15,604
Who would do something like that?

128
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:18,340
That's what we're trying to determine.

129
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:21,142
Where did they find him?

130
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:22,744
In a park. In South Central.

131
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:24,212
The colored section?

132
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,615
What on earth would he be doing there?

133
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,618
We think maybe he was
killed somewhere else,

134
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:31,020
and his body was dumped there.

135
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,122
Wait a minute...

136
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,392
I heard about this on the news.

137
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,294
They found a...

138
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:41,097
a young man with his body cut in two.

139
00:08:41,165 --> 00:08:43,733
They called him
"The Boy Dahlia."

140
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:44,634
Are you saying that...

141
00:08:45,804 --> 00:08:48,706
that Travis is "The Boy Dahlia?"

142
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:52,878
Ms. Langdon, did your
boyfriend have any enemies?

143
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,880
Anyone who might want to hurt him?

144
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,749
No.

145
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:01,452
Everybody loved Travis.

146
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:04,755
Right. Right.

147
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:06,223
Well, it's a...
it's a rubber mask.

148
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,025
I need it tested for
fingerprints and DNA.

149
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:13,562
Mr. Harmon, my name
is Peter McCormick.

150
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,497
I'm a truant officer for LAUSD.

151
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:17,832
Uh... yeah, uh, come in.

152
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,001
Living room. Please.
Thanks.

153
00:09:20,068 --> 00:09:22,103
Right, well, no, I don't need to...

154
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:23,538
I... I don't need
to be transferred,

155
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,673
I just want to know which department.

156
00:09:32,213 --> 00:09:34,313
Oh, I'm so sorry.

157
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,115
That was a urgent matter.

158
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:37,349
You have blow-flies.

159
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,784
Oh, God.

160
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:40,552
We shouldn't have left food out.

161
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,121
I guess I better call
the exterminator, then.

162
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:46,858
So, I assume you're here for Violet.

163
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,861
I know she's missed
a few days of school.

164
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:51,730
Yes. 16 consecutive days.

165
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:54,333
Sixteen?

166
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,335
Yeah.

167
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:57,402
We've made numerous attempts

168
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,304
to contact your wife,
Mr. Harmon.

169
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,807
It's the only contact
information we have.

170
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:03,041
Any more absences, and we're

171
00:10:03,109 --> 00:10:05,243
going to be seeing you
in juvenile court.

172
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:10,048
♪ I could be a smack freak ♪

173
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,416
♪ And hate society... ♪

174
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:13,151
Violet.

175
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:14,586
I need to talk to you.

176
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:15,954
♪ I could play God... ♪

177
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,760
I don't feel well.

178
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,195
Can I come in, please?

179
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:32,671
Is this about school?

180
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:35,074
Yes. It's about school.

181
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:36,976
If you want to give
me the parent drill,

182
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:38,578
'cause it's going to
make you feel better...

183
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,246
Why would it make me feel better?

184
00:10:40,313 --> 00:10:42,515
Because... I know it's
really important to you

185
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:43,883
to be a good father.

186
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:47,755
Only if I've been a good father.

187
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,791
And I've been a lousy father lately.

188
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,929
I owe you an apology.

189
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,231
Is this some headshrinker trick

190
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:57,833
to make me feel sorry for you?

191
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:02,572
I can't imagine what this year's
been like for you;

192
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,407
moving and starting a new school

193
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,843
and all the craziness
that happened to us here.

194
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:10,712
Hey, remember last year
when you announced

195
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,281
you were going to Harvard?

196
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:14,283
I probably said that
to make you happy.

197
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,384
I knew that.

198
00:11:16,452 --> 00:11:18,954
I also knew that you were smart

199
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,256
and you can go
anywhere you want for college.

200
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:29,863
Come on, Violet.

201
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:30,997
What are you doing?

202
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,834
This isn't like you.

203
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,505
I can't go back, Dad.

204
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,141
Okay, okay, honey, okay.

205
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:43,576
We'll find you another school.

206
00:11:43,644 --> 00:11:45,445
No, they're all the same!

207
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:49,449
Honey, you have to meet me halfway.

208
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,585
We'll find you a new school,

209
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,720
but you have to start going tomorrow.

210
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,856
Otherwise, we'll end up
in juvenile court.

211
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,625
Deal?

212
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:07,031
Deal.

213
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:14,939
Constance.

214
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:16,140
Hello, Lawrence.

215
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,943
Am I interrupting anything?

216
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,178
No. Uh... come in.

217
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,347
I was so sorry to intrude.

218
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:27,384
I just, I didn't know
where else to turn.

219
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:31,088
I needed some human...

220
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,191
...contact, I suppose.

221
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,059
I'm so bereft.

222
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,162
I mean, how much tragedy,

223
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,897
how much loss,

224
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,532
can one woman endure?

225
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:46,635
Travis is dead.

226
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,105
Murdered.

227
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:51,206
Wow.

228
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:52,974
Wow. That's awful.

229
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,108
Yes.

230
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:55,943
So young.

231
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:59,013
So beautiful.

232
00:13:00,616 --> 00:13:01,716
Not like you!

233
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:03,886
Constance! Constance!

234
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:05,254
That's why you killed m, isn't it?

235
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:06,255
No!

236
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:08,524
Because you knew I desired him

237
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:10,927
like I could never desire you.

238
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,362
No, no, no, no, you got it wrong.

239
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,699
Now, likely I won't have
the upper body strength

240
00:13:15,767 --> 00:13:19,770
to saw you in half
the way you did my poor Travis,

241
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:23,007
but I certainly could cut off some

242
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:26,010
of the smaller parts.

243
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:28,012
No-no-no-no-no!
I just moved the body!

244
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,448
I didn't kill him, I swear!

245
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,116
He must've pissed off
somebody in the house.

246
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:35,420
I don't know which one!

247
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,556
It could even have been
your son, for all I know.

248
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:39,924
He's got quite a temper on him.

249
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,292
In the house?

250
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,028
Travis died in the house?

251
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:45,296
I didn't ask any questions.

252
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:46,998
I just moved the, you know, parts.

253
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:48,266
I've got to go to him.

254
00:13:48,334 --> 00:13:49,600
Constance, please!

255
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:51,869
Please, baby, he's dead and I'm here.

256
00:13:51,937 --> 00:13:53,971
And I'm alive and I still love you.

257
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,274
That's your problem.

258
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,310
No, you love me, too, I know it!

259
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:01,680
Are you crazy?!
Are you crazy?

260
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:04,550
God, I never loved you.

261
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:09,990
I endured you...
for the sake of my family.

262
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,259
That is all.

263
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:14,662
So you're going back to your boy?

264
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,930
Your dead boy?

265
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:19,434
Even dead...

266
00:14:19,501 --> 00:14:21,569
even a boy...

267
00:14:21,637 --> 00:14:23,372
he's twice the man you are.

268
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,574
Well, he is now.

269
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:53,465
Shh, shh!
Just listen to me. Listen.

270
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,468
Don't be mad.

271
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:57,735
I love you.

272
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,604
Spend the day with me.

273
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,840
We can play Scrabble, if you want.

274
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:04,275
I'll even let you win.

275
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:09,080
I can't.
I promised my dad.

276
00:15:09,148 --> 00:15:10,481
So go tomorrow.
It's not like

277
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,150
they're gonna miss you
for one more day.

278
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:24,263
Come on, Violet.

279
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:36,576
Ms. Langdon, we have a few
follow-up questions.

280
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,245
Not now.
This isn't a good time.

281
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,315
We spoke to the Korean gentleman
at the corner store.

282
00:15:41,383 --> 00:15:42,683
He remembers your boyfriend

283
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:44,652
and all the awful fights
you used to have.

284
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,754
Those Koreans-- they're
so suspicious, you know,

285
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,955
ever since Hiroshima.

286
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:53,761
That's a concealed weapon.

287
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,296
Why are you carrying that?

288
00:15:55,364 --> 00:15:59,434
Maybe because you had reason

289
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,069
to visit the colored section of town?

290
00:16:01,137 --> 00:16:03,037
Why don't you come down

291
00:16:03,105 --> 00:16:04,706
to the precinct,
Ms. Langdon?

292
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,830
I knew it.

293
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:15,316
What'd I tell you?

294
00:16:15,436 --> 00:16:16,206
All these old houses,

295
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,769
they got crawlspaces
of, like, three feet.

296
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:21,872
It's like a gated community
for vermin of every sort.

297
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,074
You follow these flies

298
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:26,143
and you will find
the source of your problem.

299
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:30,547
Great, more money I gotta spend

300
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,482
on this goddamn house
that I can't afford.

301
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,252
So, can you do it?
You are in luck, Mr. Harmon.

302
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,087
My last appointment blew me off,

303
00:16:37,155 --> 00:16:39,023
so I got an opening on my dance card.

304
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:41,392
And what's your rate?

305
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,728
I'm gonna have to get in
the crawlspace before I can

306
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:44,963
give you an estimate.

307
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:46,965
But I can tell you this much:

308
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,903
for the money, I'm the best
exterminator on the market.

309
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,672
Okay, Phil, take a look.

310
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,774
Get me an estimate.

311
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:56,009
<i>This is a disgrace.</i>

312
00:16:56,076 --> 00:17:01,614
You two... bunglers...

313
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:03,115
have come to harass

314
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:06,985
the one person in this City of Angels

315
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:11,924
who not only has nothing
to do with this crime,

316
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,493
but is singularly devastated by it.

317
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:19,164
You are interrupting
a grieving process

318
00:17:19,232 --> 00:17:21,866
that started with the death
of my daughter.

319
00:17:21,934 --> 00:17:23,501
And now Travis.

320
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,103
That's right.
You have been touched

321
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,306
by a fair amount of tragedies.

322
00:17:28,374 --> 00:17:30,308
Lots of people dying near you.

323
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:32,944
Let's see, there was your son,

324
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,145
Beau, was it?

325
00:17:34,213 --> 00:17:36,381
How old was he when he died?

326
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:40,619
Beauregard was a mere boy.

327
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,621
Taken too soon by his condition.

328
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:45,458
Shitload of noise complaints
from the neighbors.

329
00:17:47,695 --> 00:17:50,364
He was an exuberant boy.

330
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:51,532
Full of life.

331
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,969
Until he died
of "natural causes."

332
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,204
There was Tate, of course,
a mass murderer.

333
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:59,940
I will not sit here

334
00:18:00,008 --> 00:18:04,877
and listen to this recitation
of torments past.

335
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:08,147
I have grieved enough
for two lifetimes.

336
00:18:08,215 --> 00:18:13,251
Most people would be broken
by the deaths of their children,

337
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:15,987
but my nature would not permit
such weakness.

338
00:18:16,055 --> 00:18:17,189
You're right.

339
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:18,791
Let's not talk about the dead.

340
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,427
Let's talk about the missing.

341
00:18:21,495 --> 00:18:25,465
Your husband Hugo and your maid Moira.

342
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,067
They disappeared in '83?

343
00:18:27,135 --> 00:18:29,403
My husband was unfaithful,
that's true.

344
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:35,610
You know, I never understood
what he saw in her.

345
00:18:35,678 --> 00:18:40,881
Perhaps it was her coarseness
that he was attracted to.

346
00:18:40,949 --> 00:18:44,051
I heard rumors of a love nest

347
00:18:44,118 --> 00:18:46,520
somewhere down in Brazil
near the equator.

348
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,393
But I never pursued them.

349
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,262
I am not one to stand
in the way of true love.

350
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:03,871
But what does the whereabouts
of two adulterers

351
00:19:03,938 --> 00:19:06,106
have to do with the
murder of my Travis?

352
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:07,508
See, that's the thing.

353
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:10,879
In 1983, nobody in this
department thought

354
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:12,848
they were just missing.

355
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:16,151
And the D.A.,
he was about this close

356
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:19,354
to filing murder charges
on you, Ms. Langdon.

357
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,025
I would rather rot in hell
than bury you

358
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:25,827
in the same grave as your lover.

359
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,729
I ready the notes on the case.

360
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:29,997
They think you killed them.

361
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:32,033
All they had to do
was find the bodies.

362
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,304
But they never found what they
were looking for.

363
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:42,143
<i>Because there was nothing</i> <i>to find.</i>

364
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:47,383
My husband ran away from me,

365
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,451
from his responsibilities.

366
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,486
It never bothered you

367
00:19:50,554 --> 00:19:52,588
that he just disappeared?

368
00:19:58,762 --> 00:20:02,498
Once I discovered that he had cheated,

369
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:06,702
Hugo meant no more
to me than dog shit.

370
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:11,473
Oh, hello, Harry.
What are you doing here?

371
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,943
I've been assigned to the case.
No more talking.

372
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,545
Nothing more is to be said
until I consult with my client.

373
00:20:16,612 --> 00:20:18,613
But I had nothing
to do with Travis's death.

374
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,849
I have nothing to hide.

375
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:23,351
Please, Ms. Langdon.
If you don't mind...

376
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,161
Sorry to introduce myself
under these circumstances.

377
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:34,496
Harry Goodman.

378
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,634
What did they ask you about?

379
00:20:38,701 --> 00:20:40,769
Just my past.
Nothing about Travis.

380
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:42,871
Ms. Langdon, listen to me.

381
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:45,507
"The Boy Dahlia" is sexy, sensational.

382
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:48,076
It's gonna bring a lot of
attention to this department,

383
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:49,944
so they're moving fast.

384
00:20:50,012 --> 00:20:52,180
That's good. I want them
to find the murderer.

385
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:54,149
No, they want to pin it on somebody.

386
00:20:54,217 --> 00:20:56,618
And right now, that person is you.

387
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:59,021
And if you say one more word,

388
00:20:59,088 --> 00:21:00,922
you could find yourself in
a very tight spot.

389
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,500
The Verminator is here.

390
00:21:12,568 --> 00:21:17,172
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

391
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,910
If you can't pay rent, don't...

392
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,914
I knew it.

393
00:21:25,982 --> 00:21:29,651
When you're right, you're right.

394
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,420
Get ready to meet your maker.

395
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,161
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

396
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,198
Phil!

397
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,333
You're a murderer.

398
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,769
You need to stay and repent

399
00:21:46,836 --> 00:21:49,338
for the countless innocent
lives you've stolen!

400
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,683
I see.

401
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,619
Well, yes, I've heard
some great things

402
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,721
about your Chinese language program.

403
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:08,293
You're right, China's the future.

404
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,096
Hey, just out of curiosity, what
kind of financial aid packages

405
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,366
do you offer for
academic high achievers?

406
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,303
Yes, she's been an "A" student
until this semester.

407
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,271
Her IQ is north of 150.

408
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,617
Well, my daughter has a very
bright future, that I know.

409
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:33,253
Truthfully, our real concern

410
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,388
has been the kids she's been
hanging around lately.

411
00:22:35,456 --> 00:22:37,491
Hm. They're just not cut

412
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:39,592
<i>from the same cloth.</i>

413
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:45,465
Where've you been?

414
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:48,168
I just took your rook.
Checkmate in 13 moves.

415
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:52,005
What's wrong?

416
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:56,042
He wants to separate us.

417
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,043
He's gonna send you away.

418
00:22:57,111 --> 00:22:58,344
What are you talking about?

419
00:22:58,412 --> 00:23:00,012
I just heard him talking on the phone

420
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
with a boarding school,

421
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,450
asking about financial packages.

422
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,656
Makes sense.

423
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,892
He sent Mom away.

424
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,261
I don't know why I thought I was safe.

425
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,864
I just assumed I was his little girl.

426
00:23:16,932 --> 00:23:17,932
What a fantasy.

427
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:21,736
I'm so stupid and naive sometimes.

428
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:25,374
Of course he's going
to send me away, too.

429
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,717
There's nothing stupid about you.

430
00:23:35,854 --> 00:23:37,821
And I won't let him send you away.

431
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:18,887
- Hey! What are you doing
with my stuff, man? - Uh...

432
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:23,092
What? Uh, nothing.

433
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,780
I'm, uh...
I had to move it.

434
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,759
Why?
Well, it's evidence.

435
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,634
You can't leave it lying around.

436
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,269
Oh, okay.

437
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:36,906
Hey, man, um...
have I made the news?

438
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:40,042
The news... Oh, God, yeah.

439
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,344
You've been all over the news.

440
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,280
Yeah?

441
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:46,616
Well, what about--
what about Constance?

442
00:24:46,684 --> 00:24:48,251
She hasn't been in the news.

443
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:52,121
No, no, no, I mean...
how'd she take it?

444
00:24:52,189 --> 00:24:54,323
Oh.

445
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,792
Pretty hard.

446
00:24:56,927 --> 00:24:58,261
Cool.

447
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:01,897
Why doesn't she come over to see me?

448
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:06,634
Too soon, I suppose.

449
00:25:06,702 --> 00:25:09,270
Travis,
come play with us.

450
00:25:09,338 --> 00:25:11,039
Yeah, I'll be right there, girls.

451
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:19,957
Those girls...
Yeah.

452
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,659
Margaret and Angela.

453
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,460
Found 'em hiding down here.

454
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:25,829
Sweet kids.

455
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:27,697
A little needy, but...

456
00:25:29,366 --> 00:25:31,067
Oh, say, man, do you think, um,

457
00:25:31,134 --> 00:25:33,302
maybe you could
snag me some clippings?

458
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,137
You know, news articles about me?

459
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:38,873
Just thinking about starting
a little scrapbook.

460
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:41,242
Thanks.

461
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,151
See if I can
get my seat back here.

462
00:25:49,218 --> 00:25:51,887
Take it from these little dollies.

463
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:53,556
May I have some tea, please?

464
00:25:53,623 --> 00:25:55,925
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

465
00:25:55,993 --> 00:25:56,992
Best tea ever.

466
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,029
He's so good with them.

467
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
Lorraine...

468
00:26:05,268 --> 00:26:07,036
I don't think I've ever seen Margaret

469
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:08,771
take to anyone so quickly.

470
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:11,106
They've been so afraid up till now.

471
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:15,477
Lonely. We all have.

472
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,880
Why am I seeing you now after...

473
00:26:17,947 --> 00:26:19,982
after all this time?

474
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,518
You're ready now.

475
00:26:24,354 --> 00:26:26,722
You're on the cusp.

476
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,026
Lorraine, I'm...

477
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:33,363
I'm so sorry...

478
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,298
For everything.

479
00:26:39,603 --> 00:26:41,070
Prove it.

480
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,343
I'm gonna make her pay.

481
00:26:47,411 --> 00:26:52,349
Lorraine, I'll see to it
that Constance rots in prison

482
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,819
for what she did to our family.

483
00:26:54,887 --> 00:26:59,424
Constance didn't do anything
to our family, Larry.

484
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,593
She didn't break any vows, hmm?

485
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,029
That was you.

486
00:27:25,886 --> 00:27:29,088
You sick son of a bitch!
Show your face!

487
00:27:30,157 --> 00:27:31,223
Who are you?!

488
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:51,509
You raped my wife!
You raped my wife!

489
00:27:51,577 --> 00:27:52,877
You raped my wife!

490
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:55,480
Show me your face!

491
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:59,418
Who are you?! Who are you?!

492
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:25,077
Tate...

493
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,681
Violet!

494
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,851
Wha... Wha...

495
00:28:36,856 --> 00:28:40,726
The only reason I'm not
killing you is for her.

496
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,328
You need to take a little nap,

497
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,630
and then it'll all be over.

498
00:28:51,838 --> 00:28:54,273
Vanilla latte.

499
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:58,343
Uh, nonfat, decaf,
sugar-free shot.

500
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,446
Nothing in it that's bad for you.

501
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,048
What's wrong?

502
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:04,150
They didn't say.

503
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,486
They just want us down

504
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:08,354
at the police station
as soon as possible.

505
00:29:08,422 --> 00:29:12,758
Now I have already answered
all their questions.

506
00:29:12,826 --> 00:29:15,261
They cannot pin this murder on me.

507
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,597
Something new must have surfaced.

508
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:20,666
An eyewitness, a piece of evidence...

509
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,602
I think you're going to be charged.

510
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:28,275
What did you do to him?

511
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:30,243
I just convinced him

512
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,479
to leave us alone for an hour or so.

513
00:29:32,547 --> 00:29:34,815
Tate, what did you do to him?!
I didn't do anything bad!

514
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:36,517
Just scared him a little.
He'll be fine.

515
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:37,985
But we're running out of time.

516
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:39,586
You're being weird.
Time for what?

517
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:41,689
I figured out how to keep
them from sending you away.

518
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:43,223
Can we run away?
Kind of.

519
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,826
Yeah. I love you, Violet.

520
00:29:45,894 --> 00:29:48,329
And I want you to be happy and free.

521
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:51,999
If we take these, we can stay here.

522
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:56,104
We can play with Beauregard,
we can play games, watch videos.

523
00:29:56,172 --> 00:29:58,106
We can be together forever.

524
00:29:58,174 --> 00:30:00,709
You want us to commit suicide?

525
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:02,944
Yeah.

526
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:05,079
And I don't think
there's enough in here

527
00:30:05,147 --> 00:30:07,949
to really, you know...

528
00:30:08,017 --> 00:30:10,318
So I think if we use these...

529
00:30:10,386 --> 00:30:12,754
Where did you get those pills?
You dad has a lot of samples.

530
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:16,024
Did you hurt my dad?
No, I told you, I just knocked him out

531
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:17,926
so I could buy us some time!

532
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,161
Listen to me, Violet, we can't
get all chicken shit about this.

533
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:23,097
We're running out of options.

534
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:30,705
Yeah. Okay, I get it.

535
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:32,006
It's the only way we can be together.

536
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,478
Like Romeo and Juliet.

537
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:40,448
I know how to do it
so that it won't hurt.

538
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:43,117
Can we do it in the bathtub?
Why?

539
00:30:43,185 --> 00:30:45,953
'Cause it's warm and nice
and I can light some candles.

540
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:49,256
Okay.

541
00:30:49,324 --> 00:30:50,858
But we have to go now.

542
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:52,692
I'll-I'll go run the bath.

543
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,160
Okay.

544
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:06,972
Help! Dad, help me!
He's trying to kill me!

545
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,575
Help!
Violet, no!

546
00:31:09,643 --> 00:31:12,578
Dad! Dad!

547
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,081
Dad?!

548
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,255
Help me!

549
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:25,258
Help!

550
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,659
Help me!

551
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,336
What's happening?
What did you do to me?

552
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:36,638
You have to stop.

553
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:38,206
Let's just do what we said we would.

554
00:31:38,274 --> 00:31:39,707
Dad, where are you?!

555
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,741
Help me!

556
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:42,109
Violet!

557
00:31:42,177 --> 00:31:43,143
Stop running!

558
00:31:58,158 --> 00:31:59,458
No...

559
00:32:11,506 --> 00:32:13,675
Please, Tate, please,
I don't want to die.

560
00:32:15,578 --> 00:32:17,546
It's too late for that.

561
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:27,280
Violet, listen to me.

562
00:32:28,051 --> 00:32:31,086
Why am I running around
like a crazy person?

563
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:33,054
Did you drug me?

564
00:32:33,122 --> 00:32:35,090
I'm not going to hurt you.

565
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:37,459
I have to show you something.

566
00:32:37,526 --> 00:32:40,195
And then you're free to
go wherever you want.

567
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,763
I promise I won't stop you.

568
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:47,502
You have to trust me.

569
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:15,230
I feel weird.

570
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:16,965
Like I'm losing it.

571
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:28,946
Come on.

572
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,771
It's so disgusting down here.

573
00:33:58,174 --> 00:34:00,175
Okay, come on.

574
00:34:01,977 --> 00:34:03,645
Close your eyes.

575
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:06,681
And remember...

576
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:08,750
everything's going to be okay.

577
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,184
I love you.

578
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:24,133
Open your eyes.

579
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:38,749
What?

580
00:34:38,817 --> 00:34:39,918
No!

581
00:34:43,556 --> 00:34:45,257
Don't you die on me!

582
00:34:46,526 --> 00:34:48,327
Violet!

583
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:51,430
I died when I took all those pills...

584
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,000
I tried to save you.

585
00:34:55,068 --> 00:34:57,202
I did.

586
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,005
I tried to make you throw them up.

587
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:02,941
You threw up some.

588
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:04,743
Not enough.

589
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:08,213
You took so many, Violet.

590
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,118
You died crying.

591
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:17,189
I held you.

592
00:35:17,257 --> 00:35:18,557
You were safe.

593
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:22,561
You died...

594
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:24,496
loved.

595
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,533
I hardly feel anything.

596
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:38,443
I didn't want you to
find out this way, Violet.

597
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,013
You or your parents.

598
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:43,916
I had this idea that
if you chose to die,

599
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:46,886
with me,

600
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:49,856
you wouldn't be so sad.

601
00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:52,993
I never wanted you to see this.

602
00:35:53,061 --> 00:35:55,862
I'm so sorry, Violet...

603
00:36:04,673 --> 00:36:06,674
Detective, I want it noted
that my client is here

604
00:36:06,742 --> 00:36:08,976
on her own volition,
and that your department

605
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:11,545
hasn't shown a shred of evidence
that could link Ms. Langdon

606
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:14,048
to the tragic murder
of Travis Wanderly.

607
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,750
We have the murder weapon, Counselor.

608
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:17,451
Well, it's not mine.

609
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,120
Whatever it is, it's not mine.

610
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:21,356
I had nothing to do with it.

611
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:23,725
You are not going to
hold me responsible

612
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:25,093
for a crime I did not commit.

613
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,574
Do you know this man?

614
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:41,408
He says he knows you.

615
00:36:41,476 --> 00:36:43,277
He did?

616
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:45,846
What else did he say?

617
00:36:45,914 --> 00:36:48,883
He says he killed Travis, alone.

618
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:51,920
Says nobody else had
anything to do with it.

619
00:36:51,988 --> 00:36:53,221
And you believed him.

620
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,191
Well, he came in with
the murder weapon.

621
00:36:55,258 --> 00:36:57,460
Described in detail what
happened to the body.

622
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,796
Details we'd never
released to the public.

623
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:02,999
Since he said he knew you,
I was hoping

624
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:05,602
you would help us with the motive.

625
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,072
Can you tell us anything
that might make sense?

626
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,942
I'm sorry, Detective.

627
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,844
I have no answers.

628
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:19,516
I can only imagine that he
confessed for one reason...

629
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:25,689
...to pacify
a guilty conscience.

630
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,198
So...

631
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:37,300
all this time, I thought
I was protecting you.

632
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,236
But you were protecting me.

633
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,908
That's all I ever wanted to do,

634
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,843
since I first saw you.

635
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,217
So why'd you keep it a secret?

636
00:37:53,285 --> 00:37:54,518
"Hi, I'm Tate.

637
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:55,686
"I'm dead.

638
00:37:55,754 --> 00:37:57,087
Wanna hook up?"

639
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:00,324
I don't think so.

640
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:05,563
I still don't remember dying.

641
00:38:07,732 --> 00:38:09,500
Do you?

642
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:12,302
Nope.

643
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,671
What happens now?

644
00:38:14,739 --> 00:38:18,042
You draw a card, and then discard.

645
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,714
No, I mean... like,
how's it going to be?

646
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,883
Just like this.

647
00:38:24,951 --> 00:38:26,885
Like it's always been.

648
00:38:28,421 --> 00:38:30,088
It's you and me.

649
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,524
Together for always.

650
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:27,247
Hello, Constance.

651
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,049
Thanks for coming to see me.

652
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,117
What do you want?

653
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:31,885
I just wanted to see you.

654
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,120
One last time.

655
00:39:34,556 --> 00:39:36,257
I wanted to take the image of you

656
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:39,694
with me into my captivity.

657
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:42,730
Well, take a good look.

658
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:45,066
It's the last time
you're ever gonna see me.

659
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,634
I know.

660
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:48,770
They're sending me out of
state to serve my sentence.

661
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:50,471
Illinois.

662
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:52,373
Though I understand that
the penitentiary there

663
00:39:52,441 --> 00:39:55,243
has a very fine theater program.

664
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,479
Well, you'll finally
have that captive audience

665
00:39:57,546 --> 00:39:58,647
you've always dreamed of.

666
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:03,652
Aren't you going to
ask me why, Constance?

667
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,154
Why what?

668
00:40:05,222 --> 00:40:10,059
Why did I confess to a crime
we both know I didn't commit?

669
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:14,997
I have long stopped asking
why the mad do mad things.

670
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:18,701
But if you thought
you were protecting me,

671
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:21,304
then you're a bigger fool
than I ever took you for.

672
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:25,808
No, I have no illusion
that you need protecting.

673
00:40:25,876 --> 00:40:29,612
From me, or any man.

674
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,880
No. No, this is about me.

675
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:36,819
I need to pay for
my crimes, Constance.

676
00:40:36,887 --> 00:40:38,754
All of them.

677
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:41,624
Well, it looks like you're
going to get your wish.

678
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,993
You're going to die in here,
you know that, don't you?

679
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:46,629
I don't mind.

680
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:47,963
I can take it.

681
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,165
I can endure it all...

682
00:40:50,233 --> 00:40:51,868
if you'll just say those words.

683
00:40:58,676 --> 00:41:00,510
I know you loved me once, Constance.

684
00:41:00,577 --> 00:41:03,513
Just say it...

685
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,315
and I can face whatever may come.

686
00:41:22,283 --> 00:41:33,176
