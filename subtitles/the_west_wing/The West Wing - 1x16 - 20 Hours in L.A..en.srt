1
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:07,952
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:10,921
- Do you ever get a night off?
- No, actually.

3
00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:12,994
It'd be cool to go out.

4
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:17,361
She asked? I should have
locked her in the dungeon.

5
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:21,562
Are you the jackass choking funding
for O'Dwyer in California?

6
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:25,272
- What is happening right now?
- You idiot! I'm Joey Lucas!

7
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:28,321
- What did I do to you?
- You made me beg.

8
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,917
I asked you
to be vice president.

9
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:33,358
- I'm gonna up your protection.
- I'm starting college.

10
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,514
You'll have plenty of friends.

11
00:00:38,123 --> 00:00:40,478
I don't like doing this to him.

12
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:44,556
I didn't want you to think
I was getting pleasure from this.

13
00:00:44,723 --> 00:00:47,601
He knew the vote would be tight.

14
00:00:47,803 --> 00:00:50,078
- It's ironic.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:54,759
It's ironic it all comes down
to a vote on the ethanol tax credit.

16
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,312
- 50-50 tie.
- I understand the irony.

17
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:59,758
- Are you being brusque?
- It's 3 a.m.

18
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:03,962
Don't blame me. That's what you get
from an even number of senators.

19
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:08,241
- Blame the Constitution.
- That's what I usually do.

20
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,716
Am I gonna meet her on the plane?

21
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:15,272
Zoey's got a new agent
on the detail.

22
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:19,482
Have you seen these agents?
They got the hair, the clothes...

23
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:24,080
...walking around campus strapped to
a .44 with a wire in their ear.

24
00:01:24,243 --> 00:01:27,633
- Really blend in.
- You don't want them blending in.

25
00:01:27,803 --> 00:01:32,593
You want them carrying a sign
that says "I'm carrying a loaded gun."

26
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:36,840
- Can I say this one last time?
- No.

27
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:41,722
- If you get tired, stay at the hotel.
- I won't get tired.

28
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:45,762
You won't sleep on the plane
and you've got the fundraiser.

29
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:49,598
- I'm coming home after.
- That's a full day and night.

30
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:54,553
Plus, round trip D.C. to L.A. in 24
hours. That's really no good for you.

31
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,839
It'll be fine.

32
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:01,200
Be that way.

33
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:05,436
Your impersonation
of my mother is getting sharper.

34
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,753
Thank you.

35
00:02:22,603 --> 00:02:24,833
Have a good flight.

36
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,678
- C.J., Charlie! My flying companions.
- Good morning, sir.

37
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:30,162
Everybody on board?

38
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:33,759
- Press in a good mood?
- I wouldn't say they were.

39
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:36,881
They're not wild about
taking off at 3 a.m.

40
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:40,240
We're gonna race the sun
to the Pacific horizon.

41
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:42,917
I'm sure that'll pick them right up.

42
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,598
Morning!
It's 50-50 on the ethanol tax credit.

43
00:02:46,763 --> 00:02:49,755
- I can still make calls.
- It's gonna be 50-50.

44
00:02:49,923 --> 00:02:52,915
We'd like to talk about
the Al Kiefer meeting.

45
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:55,313
You two are so freaked out.

46
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:57,599
- We'll listen to him.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:02:57,763 --> 00:03:00,721
Wanna see the best part
about having my job?

48
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:04,239
This is the president.
I'm ready to go.

49
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:56,993
- It's Clinique Daily Face Protector.
- SPF 15?

50
00:03:57,203 --> 00:04:01,958
- I brought SPF 15 and 30.
- Have you tried the Lancome Sun Stick?

51
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:05,798
- No, did you bring it?
- Plus Elizabeth Arden moisturizer.

52
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:08,636
You understand
we'll be there one day?

53
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,954
- There's tanning time.
- I have alabaster skin.

54
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,842
Cameron's gonna introduce
a bill tomorrow.

55
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:16,402
Gays in the military?

56
00:04:16,563 --> 00:04:19,555
- It's Cameron. Who cares?
- Ted Marcus might.

57
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,202
- He won't know.
- Might.

58
00:04:21,363 --> 00:04:23,877
You don't know,
you'll get back to him.

59
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:28,195
- It's Cameron, so who cares?
- Marcus is gonna care.

60
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:31,594
You wanted to know
when he went to the cockpit.

61
00:04:32,323 --> 00:04:35,235
This man has got to be stopped.

62
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:39,836
How you doing?

63
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:44,155
- I can't be attentive on this trip.
- It's okay, you're working.

64
00:04:44,323 --> 00:04:48,362
I've been listening to you about
how to be a better boyfriend.

65
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:53,233
- I know attentiveness--
- This is one of the times it's okay.

66
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:58,081
It's hard to tell the difference.

67
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:02,913
- I know. Doesn't that suck for you?
- A little bit, yeah.

68
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,841
Don't be nervous.

69
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:14,835
Come on in.

70
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:20,478
Mr. President,
this is Special Agent Gina Toscano.

71
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,599
- How do you do?
- Mr. President.

72
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,560
- I'll step out.
- Thank you.

73
00:05:24,723 --> 00:05:26,918
I'm sorry we haven't met before.

74
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:29,881
- You've been with Zoey, what?
- Two weeks.

75
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:32,273
From the Army?
How'd you get there?

76
00:05:32,443 --> 00:05:36,197
- I was ROTC, University of Virginia.
- A Mountaineer.

77
00:05:36,363 --> 00:05:39,355
That's West Virginia.
I'm a Cavalier.

78
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:41,639
- With a degree in...?
- Criminology.

79
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:44,920
- You were a lieutenant.
- With military police.

80
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,199
- How old are you?
- I'm 27, sir.

81
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:50,400
- How long have you trained?
- A year and a half.

82
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:54,558
- Were you the first one to sign up?
- Yes, sir.

83
00:05:56,203 --> 00:05:58,034
All right.

84
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:02,881
You know Zoey's dating
my body man Charlie?

85
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:06,672
You know about the letters?
Are they white supremacists?

86
00:06:06,843 --> 00:06:11,633
I can't say for sure. We're working
with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

87
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,637
You don't have artist sketches
or psychological profiles?

88
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,192
Not much of either one.

89
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:23,073
I know what I'm looking for in a
crowd, if that's what you're asking.

90
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:25,359
- It is.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,722
Zoey's 19, and she wants
to be a teenager.

92
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:37,479
She wants a college experience.
I loved college. So did my other kids.

93
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:42,433
I want her to be comfortable with you.
I don't want her trying to escape.

94
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:46,118
It's not your job to tell me
if she's cutting class...

95
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:50,959
...or dying her hair blue or going
to a club with her friends.

96
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:53,519
You know what your job is.

97
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:56,440
Yes, sir.

98
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,755
Thank you.

99
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:04,963
Thank you, Mr. President.

100
00:07:06,563 --> 00:07:08,599
- Gina.
- Yes, sir?

101
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,197
If she's cutting class,
I wanna know.

102
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:14,116
- No deal, Mr. President.
- Okay.

103
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,320
We didn't say it enough.

104
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:26,840
Ethanol accounts for 20%
of lowa's corn crops.

105
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,995
- The tax credit created--
- 16,000 new jobs.

106
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:33,473
- That's what we never said enough.
- Is it over?

107
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:36,840
Sam's been calling senators
for the last hour.

108
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:40,313
When my phone rings,
it'll be him saying it's over.

109
00:07:40,483 --> 00:07:43,953
- At least we're gonna win.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,438
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Leo.

111
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:49,355
You need to sign this.

112
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:53,557
And this.

113
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:59,119
Where it says your name. You're not
the Belgian foreign minister.

114
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,843
- I said I was sorry.
- I'm not upset.

115
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:04,995
- I had to stay behind for this.
- Of course.

116
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:10,317
- There'll be other trips, Margaret.
- I know. There'll be other trips.

117
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,317
- Not to California.
- Yes, to California.

118
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:18,399
They've got 54 electoral votes.
We're not gonna be strangers.

119
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,919
Leo McGarry's office.
It's Sam.

120
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,961
Get the vice president over here.

121
00:08:27,803 --> 00:08:29,077
Guys?

122
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:31,436
Everybody?

123
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:37,438
We're landing soon.
I wanted to go over the itinerary.

124
00:08:37,603 --> 00:08:39,673
At the moment we're on schedule.

125
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:43,677
The president will be met
by Congressmen Hark and Jansen...

126
00:08:43,843 --> 00:08:48,041
...the mayor and city council.
Photos only, no formal remarks.

127
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:53,835
We'll depart at 6:20, at which point
I predict we won't be on schedule.

128
00:08:54,003 --> 00:09:00,397
<i>At the hotel, the president will get</i>
<i>his briefing, followed by staff time.</i>

129
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:05,876
<i>At 10 a.m. we'll leave for a meeting.</i>
<i>The president will hear a debate...</i>

130
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:10,594
<i>...on the proposal to amend the</i>
<i>Constitution to prohibit flag-burning.</i>

131
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:16,077
<i>At 3 p.m. we go to South Central for a</i>
<i>town hall meeting on school vouchers.</i>

132
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:19,633
<i>That takes us to the event</i>
<i>you've been waiting for...</i>

133
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:22,237
<i>... the fundraiser</i>
<i>at Ted Marcus' home.</i>

134
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:26,999
<i>The press will wear coats and ties,</i>
<i>and stay in the press area...</i>

135
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:31,156
<i>...unless you've got $50,000</i>
<i>to look at the good stuff.</i>

136
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:34,520
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Local time is 5:40 a.m.</i>

137
00:09:34,683 --> 00:09:38,756
<i>The temperature's a balmy 73 degrees.</i>

138
00:09:40,043 --> 00:09:42,796
- Need help with your luggage?
- You're fine.

139
00:09:42,963 --> 00:09:44,794
There were messages for you.

140
00:09:44,963 --> 00:09:48,433
I've spent half my life
in hotels, and I can't--

141
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:51,163
- Levy.
- Later. This isn't for your room?

142
00:09:51,323 --> 00:09:53,962
- It's for yours. Mandy.
- Later. You sure?

143
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:57,752
- Yes. The deputy whip.
- Later. There used to be keys.

144
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,641
Give me that.

145
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:03,239
You stuck it in, turned it,
you're through the door.

146
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,472
I loosened it.

147
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:07,203
- Dreyfus from political affairs.
- Later.

148
00:10:07,363 --> 00:10:09,274
Joey Lucas.

149
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,434
- Really?
- Yeah.

150
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:13,321
- She called?
- Yes.

151
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,360
- She's here?
- In this hotel.

152
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:19,118
- She's in this hotel?
- She's at the fundraiser.

153
00:10:19,283 --> 00:10:20,318
Really?

154
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:27,840
- Really? Why did she call?
- To say she'll be at the fundraiser.

155
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,800
- Really?
- Yes!

156
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,996
You've got a crush on her.
Do something...

157
00:10:33,163 --> 00:10:36,041
- ...because you're bothering me.
- I don't care.

158
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,559
- Call her right now.
- I'll see her tonight.

159
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,113
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."
Know what it means?

160
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:46,554
Gather now because later
you might not be able to.

161
00:10:46,723 --> 00:10:49,476
"Interpreting the Classics"
with poet Donna Moss.

162
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:53,875
- Call her or stop bugging me.
- Let's call her.

163
00:10:54,043 --> 00:10:56,432
- Really?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

164
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:59,197
Call her,
then we'll do everybody else.

165
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:01,638
I have alabaster skin, you know.

166
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,033
- Dial the phone.
- I'm just saying.

167
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:06,592
- Also, Ted Marcus called.
- What?

168
00:11:06,763 --> 00:11:08,276
Ted Marcus called.

169
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:11,515
Hang on. Damn it.

170
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,435
Better call him first.

171
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,763
- Good morning.
- Beat me to the door.

172
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:45,960
Cameron introduced
his resolution this morning.

173
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,876
- I didn't know that.
- House Resolution 973.

174
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:52,240
- This is beautiful.
- Banning gays in the military.

175
00:11:52,403 --> 00:11:55,952
- I was on a plane all night.
- It happened this morning.

176
00:11:56,123 --> 00:12:00,002
- Studio chairman. Nice work.
- Let's not talk about my house.

177
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:05,521
What do you want to talk about?
Why'd you haul me out here?

178
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,552
You want to watch your tone. I'm
sending you home with $2.5 million.

179
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:12,918
What do I want to talk about?

180
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:17,791
Cameron's bill is a joke.
It's the House. It's procedure.

181
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:21,399
Know how many bills get introduced,
never get a vote?

182
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,600
That's it?
You came to me with that?

183
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:27,960
I came because you asked.
I've got a cab waiting.

184
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,512
- You're right.
- Don't worry about it.

185
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,959
- I'm being silly.
- It's nothing. See you later.

186
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:39,436
- The president's looking forward to it.
- Pack it up. The party's off.

187
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:43,318
I'm sorry, it's not gonna happen.

188
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,441
- The food and flowers?
- Give them to the guys.

189
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:49,800
- You're a bad bluffer.
- That's why I never do it.

190
00:12:49,963 --> 00:12:54,161
- You won't cancel the fundraiser.
- I already did.

191
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:58,874
The president will eat room service
tonight. Your cab's waiting.

192
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,881
- That was abrupt. I apologize.
- Accepted.

193
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:08,274
- You can't cancel.
- Witness the loading of trucks.

194
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:11,753
This is ridiculous.
You'll be a joke to our people.

195
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:17,043
Disrespected by the Democrats?
What will I do with my $3 billion?

196
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:20,639
No one will pass a bill
banning gays in the military.

197
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:26,002
If the House and Senate passed it,
the president would never sign it.

198
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,436
- Okay?
- Fantabulous.

199
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,072
- You won't flake on me?
- We're fine.

200
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,359
- The party's on?
- You bet.

201
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:37,519
As soon as I hear the president
say what you said.

202
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:40,880
Tell me what time
I should be tuned to my TV...

203
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:43,841
- ...to hear him say that.
- It won't happen.

204
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:47,359
Then we've got a problem.
Don't screw with me.

205
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:50,640
I've been president
longer than he has.

206
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,320
- The vice president.
- Thank you.

207
00:14:05,683 --> 00:14:07,753
- Morning.
- Mr. Vice President.

208
00:14:07,923 --> 00:14:10,517
- Still 50-50?
- That's how it'll stay.

209
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,914
- Sam talked to Huntington?
- He talked to him...

210
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,643
...he talked to Gianelli, Calley...

211
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:19,397
- ...Martinson and Rathburn.
- Recently?

212
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,633
This morning. Nobody's moving.

213
00:14:22,643 --> 00:14:26,716
- It looked like it'd go this way.
- Not to me. I was surprised.

214
00:14:26,883 --> 00:14:30,239
Well, I was in the Senate
with 94 of these guys.

215
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:32,876
Anyway....

216
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:42,359
The president needs you to fulfill
one of your constitutional duties...

217
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:47,392
...and vote for the tax credit.
We need you to break the tie.

218
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:53,280
He also asked me to tell you that he
regrets putting you in this position.

219
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:06,438
Get me off the hook.
You can't ask me to do this.

220
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:09,401
- I know how you feel.
- I don't think so.

221
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:14,512
I spent eight years in the Senate
voting against this tax credit.

222
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:17,322
I'm still right, but the point is--

223
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:22,603
16,000 new jobs. $4 billion
in plant and equipment...

224
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:25,960
...because the tax credit
made it economical.

225
00:15:26,123 --> 00:15:29,672
This tax credit has accomplished
none of its goals.

226
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:34,439
Production is minimal. It will never
reduce dependence on foreign oil.

227
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:39,552
It requires energy to produce, which
washes out any conservation effect.

228
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,441
John, what's the point?

229
00:15:43,003 --> 00:15:48,361
The Republicans will make me eat it
for dinner, and you know that.

230
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:52,715
So let's get serious.

231
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:58,961
Mr. President, I rise today
to say that the American flag...

232
00:15:59,123 --> 00:16:02,195
...is the most recognized symbol
in the world.

233
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,833
Wherever it stands,
it represents freedom.

234
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:11,282
Americans who served our nation
in war have carried it into battle.

235
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:14,003
They have been killed
for wearing it...

236
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:20,557
...as it represents the most feared
power to tyranny. That is liberty.

237
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:27,239
Mr. President,
this is not a perfect nation.

238
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,396
But to the world, our flag
represents that which is right.

239
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:34,839
To Americans it represents...

240
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:39,997
...our national unity, our national
endeavor, our national aspiration....

241
00:16:41,923 --> 00:16:44,232
I've just come from Ted Marcus'.

242
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:49,158
He's threatening to cancel unless
the president comes out against 973.

243
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:51,632
- It won't pass.
- I explained that.

244
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,715
- What did he say?
- He takes it seriously...

245
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:58,114
...and is distressed
by the president's silence.

246
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,355
He feels it's a betrayal
of the gay community...

247
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:05,641
...for him to be so publicly
supportive of the president.

248
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:10,753
It's not in his interest
for a statement to be made.

249
00:17:10,923 --> 00:17:14,120
- It'll give credibility....
- Use those words.

250
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:19,437
A man of his media savvy will realize
the president can't be blackmailed.

251
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:25,314
And should the president choose not to
kowtow to Hollywood blah-blah-blah...

252
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:30,034
...it'll only solidify his public
reputation as a man of character.

253
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:33,115
Which buys more than
$2.5 million of support.

254
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:37,834
If he has the party, he gets
10 minutes alone with the president.

255
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:40,563
- I can sell that.
- Let's go back.

256
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:42,516
How's he doing?

257
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:46,517
He looks like he's thinking
about ways to kill himself.

258
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:50,676
It's disgraceful that individuals
would desecrate the flag...

259
00:17:50,843 --> 00:17:55,633
...that our nation's veterans
have fought so valiantly to protect.

260
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:03,396
Mr. President, it's important
that we finally enact...

261
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:06,037
...legal protections for our flag.

262
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:10,515
I rise in strong support
for the flag desecration amendment.

263
00:18:10,683 --> 00:18:13,561
I'm sorry, I've just been told
I have to go.

264
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:16,954
This is a debate
that is going to continue...

265
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,433
...in town halls, city halls,
state legislatures...

266
00:18:20,603 --> 00:18:23,117
...and the House of Representatives.

267
00:18:23,283 --> 00:18:28,403
There is a group that focuses a great
deal of time and energy on this.

268
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:32,192
So much so that
I am moved to ask this question:

269
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:36,993
Is there an epidemic of flag-burning
that I'm not aware of?

270
00:18:40,723 --> 00:18:44,602
I mean it, is there an outbreak
of flag desecration?

271
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:46,674
No, so let's blow off Kiefer.

272
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:49,596
- Don't feel threatened by Kiefer.
- I don't.

273
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:54,632
Excellent. We're doing it over lunch.
Back at the hotel.

274
00:18:54,803 --> 00:18:56,759
Where's Zoey having lunch?

275
00:18:56,923 --> 00:19:00,996
A place called the Playa Cantina.
She wanted an L.A. experience.

276
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,235
- Is it good?
- They make guacamole in front of you.

277
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:05,961
That's an L.A. experience?

278
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:08,762
- She meant the people.
- There won't be any.

279
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:12,279
You'll be joining her?
It'd be easier at the hotel.

280
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,799
The hotel wouldn't make
a guacamole in front of me.

281
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:20,115
- I need to talk about Marcus.
- In the car. Who's talking to Leo?

282
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,319
He's with the vice president.

283
00:19:22,723 --> 00:19:27,353
- Sir, this lunch with Al Kiefer--
- Those people don't like me.

284
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:30,242
They haven't gotten to know you.

285
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:35,636
You'd think there was an epidemic
of flag-burning, endangering lives.

286
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:40,672
I'm having lunch with Zoey. Sit with
Kiefer, let me know when to listen.

287
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:43,232
- See you there.
- I'm not in the car?

288
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:47,032
No, you made fun of the guacamole.
You were thinking it.

289
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,431
- Fair enough.
- Good.

290
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,719
- I can't believe you did this.
- Surprised you.

291
00:19:55,923 --> 00:20:01,077
I wanted to eat lunch with L.A. people.
I wanted atmosphere.

292
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:05,555
- They cleared out the place.
- But the guy made guacamole.

293
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:08,237
- This is fun.
- I was having fun...

294
00:20:08,403 --> 00:20:12,476
...but you come within 100 meters,
and my protection quadruples.

295
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:14,599
I hadn't thought about that.

296
00:20:14,763 --> 00:20:19,314
Now that you mention it,
yeah, I think you're right.

297
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:22,441
- It is.
- Is somebody after me in California?

298
00:20:22,603 --> 00:20:27,996
All kinds of things. You've got smog,
freeway shootings, fires, mudslides.

299
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:33,191
Plus, apparently there is
a mad rash of flag-burning going on.

300
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:38,676
- You think you're funny.
- Right there, they made the guacamole.

301
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:44,361
On flag-burning, it's obvious.
If he says nothing, he takes a hit.

302
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:48,436
If he stands in opposition to it,
update your resumes.

303
00:20:48,603 --> 00:20:52,437
- I don't buy that.
- People respect a man with beliefs.

304
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:55,117
You are looking at this the wrong way.

305
00:20:55,283 --> 00:20:57,922
Don't play defense. Lead the charge.

306
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,153
- You said we couldn't.
- I didn't.

307
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:03,633
You said if we opposed it vocally,
we'd take a hit.

308
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:08,001
Right. I'm saying
don't stay quiet, and don't oppose it.

309
00:21:08,363 --> 00:21:10,718
Lead the charge the other way.

310
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,592
What?

311
00:21:13,763 --> 00:21:17,153
Has Al said something
I should listen to yet?

312
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:18,881
We'll let you know.

313
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:21,876
Do you want to sew up
re-election right now?

314
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:25,240
Want to lock down
your second term in this room?

315
00:21:25,403 --> 00:21:29,635
- What do you got?
- A truckload of voters.

316
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:33,193
About 47 percent.
Overwhelmingly white men.

317
00:21:33,363 --> 00:21:37,356
Pool and patio types who voted
against you by 20-plus points.

318
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:42,199
They share an affinity to authority,
a president.

319
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:47,795
They see you as smart, with vision.
Why didn't they vote for you?

320
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:51,433
Because they also see you as a wimp.

321
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:56,438
- Two-thirds rate you as "weak."
- We've heard these numbers.

322
00:21:56,603 --> 00:22:01,393
I never get tired of hearing them,
especially in front of my daughter.

323
00:22:02,563 --> 00:22:08,798
I know this is not a popular idea.
But I've got numbers and I trust them.

324
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:13,320
The reason you all look pale is,
so do you. This is not theoretical.

325
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:17,556
The flag-burning amendment made it
through the House easily.

326
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:22,638
It hasn't made it through the Senate
yet, but that day will come soon.

327
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:26,512
Laws against flag-burning
are overwhelmingly favored.

328
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:31,154
A constitutional amendment won't
be subject to a presidential veto...

329
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:35,316
...or overturning by the Supreme
Court. This means one thing:

330
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:38,839
It's over! The game's
been played and won.

331
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:44,441
You know the results early, so you
get to pick which side to be on.

332
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:47,720
Not only do we get
to be on the winning team...

333
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:51,273
...we get to lead
the winning team.

334
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,152
Excuse me.

335
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:02,797
- Toby, you're smiling.
- I just figured out who you were.

336
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,795
- He's gonna say Satan.
- No.

337
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:09,559
You're the guy who runs into
the 7-Eleven to get Satan cigarettes.

338
00:23:14,403 --> 00:23:15,961
- Mr. President.
- Yeah.

339
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:20,153
- We'll talk about this later.
- We will?

340
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:29,715
Eagle's moving.

341
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:34,032
- Mr. President--
- Men with patios think I'm weak.

342
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:37,957
I won't mention the 49 times
we asked you not to meet him.

343
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:40,239
Was that Marcus on the phone?

344
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:44,078
We sold him on 10 minutes
in a room with you. Ten minutes.

345
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:45,995
I used to like parties.

346
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:52,996
I just wanted a regular lunch,
in a restaurant with people.

347
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:58,191
- Dad sees danger behind curtains.
- Walk on the other side of me, okay?

348
00:23:58,363 --> 00:24:00,194
Let's get in the car, okay?

349
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:44,120
Look at this house!

350
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:47,719
- I mean, look at it.
- It's a nice house.

351
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:51,401
You haven't said anything
about my dress.

352
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:52,916
You look very nice.

353
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:56,120
- You're not looking.
- I'm looking at the house.

354
00:24:56,283 --> 00:25:01,311
Let me introduce myself. Mark Miller,
head of development at Paragon.

355
00:25:02,163 --> 00:25:06,475
Good to meet you. Does my money
buy me a few words alone with you?

356
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:10,318
Throw in chocolates and nylons,
get you more than that.

357
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:13,316
- Sure.
- I'll be at the bar drinking a lot...

358
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:16,156
- ...if anybody wants me.
- Nobody will.

359
00:25:16,323 --> 00:25:19,838
- I'll come right out. I'm a big fan.
- Thank you.

360
00:25:20,003 --> 00:25:23,632
There's a place for you
in our company. In development.

361
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,873
- What?
- Development of projects.

362
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:29,433
- What's that mean?
- You'd develop feature projects.

363
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:33,232
Movies? You don't want me.
You want Toby or Sam.

364
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:38,796
- I'm not a writer. I can't act.
- You'd just be in development.

365
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:42,558
- And what's that?
- Shepherding, developing projects.

366
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:46,511
I thought a guy writes a movie
and a guy directs a movie.

367
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:51,438
And in between there are
designers and technicians and actors.

368
00:25:51,603 --> 00:25:55,118
- So tell me what I'd do again.
- Development.

369
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:02,992
At the moment I have a good job
and I understand what it is.

370
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:06,758
I sure appreciate-- Sam!
Would you excuse me, Mark?

371
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:12,873
I'm sorry. I've gotta talk to Sam
about a thing the president wants--

372
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:16,956
Pretend you're talking to me.
Walk me outside.

373
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:20,001
Did he offer you a development deal?
Me too.

374
00:26:20,523 --> 00:26:22,957
Do you know what it is?
Me neither.

375
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:26,354
The bedrock principle
of the First Amendment...

376
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:31,551
...is that government cannot prohibit
expression because it's disagreeable.

377
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:33,873
Justice Brennan for the majority.

378
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:39,481
I'm a real fan, David. It's not just
<i>Baywatch</i> and <i>Knight Rider</i> with me.

379
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:40,632
Thank you.

380
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:45,831
<i>Nick Fury, Panic at Malibu Pier,</i>
<i>The Cartier Affair, Pleasure Cove.</i>

381
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,072
Excuse us.

382
00:26:48,363 --> 00:26:52,834
- He's into me.
- You're scaring guests. He's married.

383
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:56,313
- It's California. A girl can dream.
- Stop drinking.

384
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:58,678
Matt Perry right there. Goodbye.

385
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,075
- Josh!
- I know that voice.

386
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:12,192
How long was it gonna take
for you to say hello to me?

387
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:17,232
I got your message this morning,
but I've been running around.

388
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:20,042
I didn't see you until now.

389
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,000
I saw you.

390
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:25,836
Well, then you should
have said hello to me.

391
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:30,793
- You looked absorbed in conversations.
- I can assure you I was not.

392
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:36,838
- Well then.
- Well then, what?

393
00:27:37,763 --> 00:27:40,231
- Hello.
- Hello!

394
00:27:42,723 --> 00:27:46,352
- We're just here for the day--
- Josh, we gotta talk.

395
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:49,242
Can you not--?

396
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,319
- Don't leave the party, okay?
- Okay.

397
00:28:00,323 --> 00:28:05,761
I know we've had our ups and downs,
but let me be your guy for a second.

398
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:11,835
You can't be the first vice president
to break a tie going the other way.

399
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:17,521
- I'm not looking to make history.
- You're gonna get ink either way.

400
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:22,833
I know. It eats at you that there's
friction between you and my staff.

401
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:26,598
You think they don't respect you,
and they do.

402
00:28:26,763 --> 00:28:30,153
They don't trust you.
Neither does the president.

403
00:28:30,323 --> 00:28:35,556
I know that's blunt, but I convinced
him to put you on the ticket.

404
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:40,751
And I'm gonna be standing here
when you make history.

405
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:46,520
Allow for the possibility that my
motives might not always be sinister.

406
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:51,199
You and your staff are remarkably
smug. Frankly, so is the president.

407
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,754
The fact you think I care
if there's friction is proof of that.

408
00:28:55,923 --> 00:29:00,917
You won't set foot in the west wing,
you won't be on the ticket next time.

409
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:04,439
Leo, I think you guys set me up.

410
00:29:04,603 --> 00:29:09,552
You think the president could arrange
for a 50-50 tie in the Senate?

411
00:29:09,723 --> 00:29:13,238
I think the president can do
whatever he wants.

412
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:14,995
You're wrong.

413
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:25,720
- Where's the president?
- At Ted Marcus' fundraiser.

414
00:29:27,763 --> 00:29:30,596
I think it's time for you to call him.

415
00:29:38,563 --> 00:29:40,713
<i>Give me a reason not to fire him.</i>

416
00:29:40,963 --> 00:29:45,195
When you run out of reasons, remember
you can't fire the vice president.

417
00:29:45,443 --> 00:29:47,877
I can ask for his resignation.

418
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:50,955
I gotta tell you something
you won't like.

419
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,842
- What?
- He's right and we're wrong.

420
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:56,278
- About what?
<i>- About the ethanol tax.</i>

421
00:29:56,443 --> 00:29:58,911
- Leo's right.
- Sam's weighing in.

422
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:02,632
I got McCambridge, Aiello
and Dane to vote our way.

423
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:06,478
Send them back. We lose, and
the vice president's off the hook.

424
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,321
Let's do that.

425
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:12,400
<i>I'm not done with Hoynes,</i>
<i>but dump it.</i>

426
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:17,956
- The thing about the vice president--
- I'll call him from the plane.

427
00:30:19,963 --> 00:30:21,999
Craziest thing I've ever heard.

428
00:30:23,003 --> 00:30:26,552
- Jay, you can't drive all those cars.
- Not all at once.

429
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:28,281
I know not all at once.

430
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:33,756
- Claudia Jean, this is Veronica Webb.
- Pleasure to meet you.

431
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:36,517
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Excuse me.

432
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:40,198
The president appreciates
your laying off Leo McGarry.

433
00:30:40,363 --> 00:30:44,356
- It hasn't gone unnoticed.
- You give me material every night.

434
00:30:44,523 --> 00:30:48,914
- Well, if there's anything I can do.
- You know what would be great?

435
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:52,712
Get the president
to drive his bike into a tree again.

436
00:30:52,883 --> 00:30:55,841
It's my bread and butter.
It's what I live on.

437
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:59,075
You're very funny.
How does she look like that?

438
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:02,558
Clean living. Prayer.

439
00:31:03,563 --> 00:31:04,882
Gotta go.

440
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:11,123
Sorry, I gotta talk to Sam.
Pretend you're talking to me again.

441
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,672
- Let's use code names.
- Where's Josh?

442
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:18,519
Talking to that woman. Maybe they're
just pretending to be talking.

443
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:20,116
Indeed.

444
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:24,276
- Wanna know what we did for lunch?
- What?

445
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:28,152
We met a pollster who said
we could sew up re-election...

446
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:32,714
...if the president favored
a flag-burning amendment.

447
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:34,441
- I heard.
- How?

448
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,517
I hear everything.

449
00:31:40,283 --> 00:31:43,719
It was a stupid joke.
I don't get a sympathy laugh?

450
00:31:44,483 --> 00:31:48,078
Seriously, this guy
had some pretty scary numbers.

451
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:51,155
Josh, I just made
a three-picture deal.

452
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:54,713
- A deal to do what?
- It doesn't seem to matter.

453
00:31:54,883 --> 00:31:57,351
This is Joey Lucas
and her assistant.

454
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:00,515
You're running
O'Dwyer's campaign in the 46th.

455
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,275
I know who you are.

456
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:11,322
I was telling her
about Kiefer's numbers.

457
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:14,680
I've seen those numbers.
We share polling data.

458
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:17,721
- And?
- Kiefer asked the wrong questions.

459
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:22,832
His poll said 80% favored
a flag-burning amendment.

460
00:32:23,003 --> 00:32:26,552
The same percentage favors
sending litterbugs to prison.

461
00:32:27,243 --> 00:32:32,078
- He never asked how much they care.
- Please say that you did.

462
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:40,954
- How good do I look to you right now?
- That depends on the numbers.

463
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:44,796
37%.

464
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:49,991
Less than half of those in favor rated
the issue "fairly" or "very important."

465
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:54,714
12%, less than a third,
said the issue would swing their vote.

466
00:32:55,603 --> 00:32:59,642
The only place this war
is being fought is in Washington.

467
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:04,593
You're looking
very good to me right now.

468
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,516
I thought so.

469
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,320
- Good to meet you.
- Pleasure.

470
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,042
Nice meeting you.

471
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:17,879
You have any idea how big
you just scored with Toby and Sam?

472
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:22,401
- But still....
- What?

473
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:29,555
If the president talks about this,
he should say people shouldn't do it.

474
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:33,841
It's a form of protest that,
for a lot of people, is troubling.

475
00:33:34,003 --> 00:33:37,473
- Your poll says that?
- I do. So do a lot of people.

476
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,953
<i>Vox populi vox Dei.</i>

477
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:45,913
- The voice of the people is a dog.
- The voice of God.

478
00:33:53,163 --> 00:33:55,961
- I came here with someone.
- I'm sorry?

479
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,874
I came here with someone.

480
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:10,281
I should go. I have to go.

481
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:15,112
Wait. Will you call me
next time you come out here?

482
00:34:15,843 --> 00:34:17,196
Absolutely.

483
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,281
I will call in advance of my coming.

484
00:34:23,683 --> 00:34:26,595
It was really good to see you.

485
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:30,035
You too.

486
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:39,760
I don't need to tell you
that I've got a large microphone...

487
00:34:39,923 --> 00:34:44,201
...and I'm gonna demand you announce
you'll veto Cameron's bill.

488
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:47,161
It won't pass.
It won't get voted on.

489
00:34:47,323 --> 00:34:49,791
I'm saying, as a gesture.
As a symbol.

490
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:55,356
As a gesture, as a symbol, demand that
and you'll be Cameron's friend.

491
00:34:55,523 --> 00:34:57,673
The people in my house want this.

492
00:34:57,843 --> 00:35:01,358
They're complaining that
you take money without listening.

493
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:04,833
Give me the name
of one person who's complaining.

494
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:08,996
I'll call personally and say
I'll never sign a law like that.

495
00:35:09,163 --> 00:35:11,552
- Then why won't you say that--
- Ted.

496
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:16,920
- Why won't you say that publicly?
- Because I know what I'm doing!

497
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:20,120
I live in the world
of professional politics...

498
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:24,117
...and you live in the world
of adolescent tantrum!

499
00:35:24,963 --> 00:35:29,115
Don't you ever
slap Josh Lyman around again.

500
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:33,515
He's the deputy chief of staff.
He's not some associate producer.

501
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:36,038
- You're right.
- Don't screw with me.

502
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:38,637
- You're right.
- Right this second...

503
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,877
...the worst thing that could happen
would be to put that up for debate...

504
00:35:44,043 --> 00:35:47,399
...which happens as soon as
I open my mouth. Get it?

505
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,793
I'm a human starting gun!

506
00:35:49,963 --> 00:35:54,479
- Trust me. I know what I'm doing.
- I do trust you. I do.

507
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:57,316
And I like you too.

508
00:36:03,123 --> 00:36:04,715
Thank you.

509
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,722
Have you enjoyed yourself tonight?

510
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,676
No.

511
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,515
Me neither.

512
00:36:24,323 --> 00:36:26,632
If you don't mind my saying...

513
00:36:26,803 --> 00:36:31,160
...you look more tired than you did
a couple of months ago.

514
00:36:31,323 --> 00:36:35,919
Imagine how tired I'm gonna look
a couple of months from now.

515
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,677
I haven't slept well lately.

516
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:44,558
Kept everyone up
on the plane on the way out.

517
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:48,235
You know, we left at 3 in the morning.

518
00:36:49,963 --> 00:36:53,672
I really want to try
to sleep on the way back.

519
00:37:01,403 --> 00:37:03,633
- That was it?
- Yeah.

520
00:37:03,803 --> 00:37:08,354
- Because she was with somebody?
- She was with somebody.

521
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,833
- She's with somebody.
- She could've just said that.

522
00:37:12,003 --> 00:37:15,598
- Why would she have been saying that?
- For the allure.

523
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:17,719
- Go see her.
- It's 1:00 a.m.

524
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,032
Knock on her door.

525
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,001
I'm not gonna knock on her door
at 1 a.m.

526
00:37:22,163 --> 00:37:25,314
You had to see her once more
before you left...

527
00:37:25,483 --> 00:37:28,793
...because God knows
what fate awaits you there.

528
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,193
- Are you okay?
- Gather ye rosebuds.

529
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:34,002
I am not gonna knock on her door.

530
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:39,560
Were you just clucking?
Was that what that was?

531
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,873
I don't have her room number.

532
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,557
Yes, you do. Phone message!

533
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:48,193
First of all, don't do
that anymore. "Phone message!"

534
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:49,956
And?

535
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:53,562
Tell them I'll be down in one minute.

536
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:58,353
- How's she gonna know I'm knocking?
- There's a button. A light flashes.

537
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:01,599
I'll be there in a minute.

538
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:24,235
- What can I do for you?
- You know, I got the wrong room.

539
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:27,475
I don't think so.
You looking for Joey?

540
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:29,474
- Yeah.
- She's right here.

541
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:32,680
No, I'm not.
I was stopping to say goodbye.

542
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,595
- Don't bother.
- Who's there?

543
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:45,159
I wanted to say goodbye.
We're taking off.

544
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,154
And....

545
00:38:47,323 --> 00:38:51,475
Thank you for talking to us tonight.
That was helpful.

546
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:58,634
She said goodbye.

547
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:00,436
I know.

548
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,434
Goodbye.

549
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:39,475
Anyway, Mr. Vice President,
it's taken care of.

550
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,873
- We can put it to rest.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

551
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:44,511
- You're welcome. Bye.
<i>- Good night.</i>

552
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:48,153
- Wait. John?
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

553
00:39:48,323 --> 00:39:52,521
I wanna tell you,
a couple of years ago in lowa...

554
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:57,154
...I admired the way you hung in there
on the ethanol tax credit.

555
00:39:57,323 --> 00:40:00,713
You said what you'd been saying
for eight years...

556
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:03,875
...even though you knew
it wasn't gonna play.

557
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:09,276
My confession is, you and I agree on
ethanol, but only you said it.

558
00:40:09,443 --> 00:40:14,563
You stood in there even though
you knew you were gonna lose lowa.

559
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:17,272
Anyway...

560
00:40:17,443 --> 00:40:19,911
...I just wanted to say...

561
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:22,592
...you had a good day today.

562
00:40:22,803 --> 00:40:24,998
<i>Thank you, Mr. President.</i>

563
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,159
I'm gonna try to sleep now.

564
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:31,599
<i>Good night. See you in the morning.</i>

565
00:41:38,203 --> 00:41:39,192
