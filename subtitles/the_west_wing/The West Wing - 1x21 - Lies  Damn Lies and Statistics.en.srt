1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,286
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:12,492
They wanna know how I didn't know
about the memo.

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:14,484
Amateur mistakes make me crazy.

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:19,647
I just got called amateur twice. The
chief of staff can do it, you can't.

5
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:23,283
Get Leo candidates who back
campaign finance reform.

6
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:28,482
The fight to restore American
democracy begins here in this room!

7
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,282
- Don't keep things from me.
- I'm friendly with a woman.

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:35,525
You can't spend time
with a call girl, Sam.

9
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:39,968
It's 7:05.

10
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:42,169
- It's 10 to 7.
- No, it's not.

11
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:45,052
- It's 7:05?
- I'm not making it up.

12
00:00:45,293 --> 00:00:47,363
- My watch says 10 to 7.
- It sucks.

13
00:00:47,533 --> 00:00:51,162
My watch is fine.
How do we know it's not 10 to 7?

14
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:56,328
Those clocks run by the Navy say your
watch sucks in four time zones.

15
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,609
- Six is asymmetrical.
- It's fine.

16
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:03,403
"Are things going in the right
direction or on the wrong track?"

17
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:06,042
- Good point.
- Guys, it's 7:05.

18
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:09,330
"Direction" and "track"
are different words.

19
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:11,928
- Thank you, Funk & Wagnalls.
- What?

20
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,448
- They make the dictionary.
- I know.

21
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,490
- Why'd you ask?
- It's 7:05.

22
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:20,612
- The question is asymmetrical.
- It originated decades ago...

23
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:24,362
...and has been a predictor
of voters' behavior.

24
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:26,490
I have a problem with 14.

25
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:31,682
"Do you think the president puts
the needs of average people first?"

26
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,128
"Average" is pejorative.

27
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:40,721
80% of people in this country would
use "average" to describe themselves.

28
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:45,290
Being considered an average American
is positive and comforting.

29
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,524
- C.J.?
- Yes?

30
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:51,442
- "He cares about people like me--"
- We went over this.

31
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:54,287
- We need to talk about six.
- We don't.

32
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,684
- Since when are you an expert?
- Since 1993.

33
00:01:57,893 --> 00:02:00,407
- Since when are you a pain?
- Before that.

34
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,531
"Bartlet cares about people like me."
Agree?

35
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:07,971
Can't "people like me" be taken
to mean the interviewer?

36
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:12,126
- Usually it's, "people like yourself."
- Or "people like you."

37
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:14,933
- "Yourself" is softer.
- Softer is bad?

38
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,367
Softer is better.

39
00:02:16,613 --> 00:02:22,051
Separating the respondent with
"people like yourself" is pejorative.

40
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:24,124
Take this up with Josh.

41
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:27,968
Eastern Standard Time is at dinner.
The poll is fine.

42
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,282
It's important.

43
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,809
If we don't start
the phone banks now...

44
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:37,285
...I won't have time to leak
the internals to media outlets.

45
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:41,765
We've climbed out of the hole,
only we can't tell anybody...

46
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:45,568
...because we stood here
arguing about asymmetry.

47
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,562
It's time.

48
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:51,969
- Wanna make a prediction?
- Hold at 42% job approval.

49
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,966
- We'll hold steady.
- I'll be happy if we do.

50
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:58,324
It'll be inside the plus or minus.

51
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:03,249
- C.J.?
- We're gonna go up five points.

52
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,971
- President thinks we'll hold.
- He's wrong.

53
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,283
- You think?
- Yes.

54
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:15,527
Let's find out.
Toby, tell Sam to start the banks.

55
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,328
Sam Seaborn. Okay.

56
00:03:25,733 --> 00:03:28,122
Let's get our report card.

57
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:31,322
Okay, here we go!

58
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:30,568
Hey, Sam. How's it going in there?

59
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:33,531
I popped Mandy
with my tranquilizer gun.

60
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,322
- Why does it take 48 hours?
- We need 1500 responses.

61
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,882
It takes 30 people 48 hours?

62
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:46,368
It takes 12 hours to make 1500 calls.
We need 1500 responses, 6000 calls.

63
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:50,128
- Only one in four don't hang up?
- If you're lucky.

64
00:04:54,493 --> 00:05:00,170
The law school graduation is tomorrow.
Were you gonna go see your friend?

65
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:02,051
- Laurie?
- Yeah.

66
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:05,968
- Call her Laurie.
- You gonna see her graduate?

67
00:05:06,213 --> 00:05:07,885
Yeah.

68
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:12,601
- You can't.
- Okay.

69
00:05:12,853 --> 00:05:17,643
I believe Steve Onorato knows.
He'll use it to embarrass us.

70
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:19,482
Okay.

71
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,287
They know who this girl is,
they know she's graduating.

72
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,331
They know it's a place you'll be--

73
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:29,450
- Laurie.
- What?

74
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:33,242
- You called her "this girl."
- Sam, you can't.

75
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:37,532
- Okay, do you see me arguing with you?
- No.

76
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,285
- Anything else?
- Nope.

77
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:47,646
Biggest day of her life. Huge day.

78
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:51,926
She put herself through school.
People in South Carolina--

79
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:56,405
- Not just South Carolina.
- I don't understand what business--

80
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,928
You can't go, Sam.

81
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:04,123
- I'm not going.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,487
- Leo.
- Is he here?

83
00:06:20,733 --> 00:06:23,770
- Yeah.
- Wait for a minute, then send him in.

84
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:28,848
- Okay. Why do you want me to wait here?
- Because I do.

85
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,129
Okay.

86
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:41,722
- Feels weird not doing anything.
- Yeah.

87
00:06:46,693 --> 00:06:49,969
- It feels weird because--
- Okay, send him in.

88
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,329
Okay.

89
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,851
- Barry.
- Yes.

90
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:03,732
- Leo McGarry.
- Barry Haskel.

91
00:07:03,973 --> 00:07:07,010
Is this your first time
in the White House?

92
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:08,766
In the west wing.

93
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,926
No one's ever invited
you to the White House?

94
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:17,763
Not to the west wing. I go
to the Christmas party at OEOB.

95
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:22,689
Last Christmas the vice president
stopped in for a moment.

96
00:07:24,773 --> 00:07:29,369
I wanted to talk to you about
soft-money contributions.

97
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:31,410
Right, I had a hunch.

98
00:07:31,653 --> 00:07:34,292
- Could I have some juice?
- Thirsty?

99
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:38,924
This is the first time I've been
called to the chief of staff--

100
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:40,162
Little nervous?

101
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:45,083
- You walk past a Marine coming in--
- Rodney.

102
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:49,206
- I didn't catch his name.
- Rodney's great. Rodney!

103
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:50,966
Yes, Mr. McGarry?

104
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:54,523
Could you do that thing
you were doing before?

105
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:10,446
- Thanks, Rodney.
- Anytime, sir.

106
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:12,883
And that rifle's really loaded.

107
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,805
- Mr. McGarry--
- Leo.

108
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:19,081
There's no need to be nervous.
You're one of us.

109
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,368
I'm sorry?

110
00:08:20,613 --> 00:08:26,006
I say, we know you're one of us.
Six commissioners on the FEC.

111
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:31,088
Two resigned, leaving four, including
you. The belief is that none of you...

112
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:36,726
...favor a ban on soft-money
contributions. But the truth is you do.

113
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,761
- That's not true.
- I know it is because you said so.

114
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:46,804
You said so to the <i>Newark Star-Ledger</i>
in March 1995. "Money isn't speech."

115
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:52,252
And you said so two years before
that to the <i>Detroit Free Press.</i>

116
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:57,925
"We must reverse the 1978 regulatory
decision allowing soft money."

117
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:02,451
I gave those quotes on the condition
of anonymity.

118
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:08,131
I went to drug rehab on the condition
of anonymity. Maybe you read about it.

119
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:13,208
Barry, you wanna ban soft money.
You're one of us.

120
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:15,924
You've been outed.

121
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:21,123
Being outnumbered
five to one on the FEC...

122
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:25,406
...it never made sense to me
to swim against the grain.

123
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:28,486
I would've been irrelevant--

124
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,770
You'd have had a hard time
getting re-upped.

125
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,846
But if we hadn't gone and found you...

126
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,523
...you'd never have been
invited to the White House.

127
00:09:38,773 --> 00:09:41,287
When I got the call
from your office...

128
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:45,486
...my wife and her friends said
this is what would happen.

129
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,722
What's that?

130
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:50,164
That you'd use the trappings
of the White House.

131
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:53,126
That there would be
a sort of intimidation--

132
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:56,564
No one's intimidating you, Barry,
you're with us.

133
00:09:56,813 --> 00:10:01,284
You were wandering in the darkness,
but we came and found you.

134
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:06,402
- And welcome back to the pack.
- Coercion, then?

135
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:12,370
And I notice that I'm sitting here
in the chief of staff's office...

136
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:18,011
...and my wife says
it's not uncommon for people...

137
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:22,451
...to get lightheaded and starstruck.

138
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,412
I've heard the same thing
from others too.

139
00:10:25,653 --> 00:10:29,566
Nonsense.
Let me show you around the place.

140
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:34,405
- If I could just get some water.
- No problem. We keep it in here.

141
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:42,441
- Sorry to interrupt.
- We're just having a nightcap.

142
00:10:42,693 --> 00:10:46,083
I'd like you to meet Barry Haskel
from the FEC.

143
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:48,289
May I present Kenneth Kato.

144
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,763
- Mr. Attorney General.
- Dan Larsen.

145
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:53,288
- Rob Konrad.
- It's good to see you.

146
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:56,809
Jed Bartlet.
You're thinking about helping us out?

147
00:10:57,053 --> 00:11:01,808
- That makes me so happy.
- It's an honor to meet you, sir.

148
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:04,362
- Barry's thirsty.
- Get him a drink.

149
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:08,288
- They'll take good care of you.
- Have a drink.

150
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,522
Leo.

151
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:16,563
- Put him in the boat--
- This could be for nothing.

152
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:18,843
If the numbers....
Did we start?

153
00:11:19,093 --> 00:11:22,483
We put the poll in the field
three hours ago.

154
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,850
All right. Did the guys
make any predictions?

155
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,288
- I didn't ask.
- Yes, you did.

156
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:34,085
They think we'll hold at 42.
Toby thinks we dropped a few points.

157
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:38,770
It could be worse than holding at 42.
If the numbers go down...

158
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:42,926
...I'm just a guy with Barry Haskel
in his office.

159
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:44,526
I'll stop back.

160
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,731
- A Marine guarding your door?
- Too showy?

161
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:52,569
- What's he supposed to be guarding?
- I'll be right in here.

162
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:56,089
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

163
00:12:02,213 --> 00:12:04,852
You are graduating tomorrow, and--

164
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:09,768
And yet you're in a library, studying.

165
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:13,449
- It's called the bar exam.
- Are you taking it tonight?

166
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:17,162
- No.
- Well, then, let's go out.

167
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:19,682
Give me 10 more minutes.

168
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:23,042
- Oh, God, is that me?
- That's me.

169
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:29,291
- The advantages of being a waitress.
- No bar exam?

170
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:33,890
- You won't be a waitress forever.
- Answer your phone.

171
00:12:35,053 --> 00:12:36,042
Hello?

172
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:38,403
<i>- You're in the library?</i>
- It's you.

173
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,052
On the night before?

174
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:44,001
<i>Three years of law school,</i>
<i>I don't understand real estate.</i>

175
00:12:44,253 --> 00:12:47,131
- Nobody does. Listen--
- You can't come?

176
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:48,726
<i>No.</i>

177
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:52,763
I understand.

178
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:59,647
There's reason to believe a staffer
knows that I know you.

179
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:05,086
He's been waiting for the moment
it would cause the most trouble.

180
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,803
- And that moment's now?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

181
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:13,368
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay, but--

182
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:17,526
Don't kill yourself.
I know you'll be thinking about me.

183
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:19,525
<i>I will.</i>

184
00:13:20,893 --> 00:13:22,804
Go knock 'em dead tomorrow.

185
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:26,887
- Okay.
<i>- Okay.</i>

186
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:34,890
- He can't make it.
- Yeah, I kind of guessed.

187
00:13:35,133 --> 00:13:40,890
- Don't worry about it.
- That's right. This is your week.

188
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,052
You know what's fun?

189
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:53,004
- Jogging around the Potomac.
- Were you jogging?

190
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:57,644
No, I was sitting on a bench,
but jogging looked good to me.

191
00:13:57,893 --> 00:14:02,489
Bonnie, arrange a meeting with
Ross Kassenbach, as soon as possible.

192
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,203
- I need two minutes with the president.
- Found one?

193
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:09,604
- What?
- Ambassador to Micronesia.

194
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:14,768
Is that a real country? Sounds like
a place the Marx brothers--

195
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:18,164
The president's got two minutes
in two minutes.

196
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,204
Come with me for this.

197
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:23,490
Based on what
is he making that claim?

198
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:26,087
We've been out there for weeks!
Morning.

199
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:31,088
We've been out there. <i>Crossfire,</i>
<i>Meet the Press, The Today Show.</i>

200
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:35,531
<i>Good Morning Scottsdale, Time,</i>
<i>Newsweek, Popular Mechanics.</i>

201
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:39,083
We're talking about treatment,
not legalization.

202
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:43,008
The same memo has been generated
by every administration.

203
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:47,485
- How do you wanna handle it?
- By saying that it's the same memo.

204
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:52,648
It sounds like we're soft.
Onorato says I wanna legalize drugs.

205
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:56,129
It's been the exact same memo
for 30 years.

206
00:14:56,373 --> 00:15:00,605
- That's exactly what you should say.
- Thanks.

207
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:05,846
Leo said you guys predicted
we'd hold steady at 42.

208
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:08,607
Do you really think
we held our ground?

209
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:12,687
- I said we might drop a couple.
- I think we held our ground.

210
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:18,212
I didn't say we'd hold steady, sir.
I said we'd gain five points.

211
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:20,290
- Yeah?
- Yes, sir.

212
00:15:21,013 --> 00:15:25,689
Well, okay.
Anybody wanna offer C.J. the odds?

213
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,810
- Talk to the press.
- Yes.

214
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:34,173
Tell them every administration
for 30 years has generated that memo.

215
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,882
That's it. Thank you.
What do you got?

216
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:41,325
- Micronesia.
- Toby says it's a country.

217
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:45,202
- It is. You know where?
- In the South Pacific.

218
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:49,332
It's actually 607 small islands
in the South Pacific.

219
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,646
While its total landmass
is only 270 square miles...

220
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:58,762
...it occupies a million square miles
of the Pacific Ocean.

221
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:03,286
The U.S. Embassy is located
in the state of Pohnpei...

222
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:06,485
...not on the island of Yap.

223
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:11,284
- Why would a person know that?
- Parties.

224
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,767
- Sir?
- I looked at Micronesia.

225
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,692
- I can't fire our ambassador.
- Why not?

226
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,721
I won't have an answer
for why I fired him.

227
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:23,929
- Sam's got you covered.
- How?

228
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:28,132
- You're gonna promote the ambassador.
- To what?

229
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,689
- Ambassador to Paraguay.
- And what happens to him?

230
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,605
Ambassador to Bulgaria.

231
00:16:33,813 --> 00:16:37,965
If everybody keeps moving up one,
I get to go home.

232
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:43,492
The ambassador is having an affair
with the prime minister's daughter.

233
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,327
- That ambassador is Ken Cochran?
- Yes.

234
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:49,690
The daughter of the Bulgarian
prime minister?

235
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,810
Who is said to be upset.

236
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,931
- I can imagine.
- Do you know him, sir?

237
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:57,289
- The prime minister?
- Cochran.

238
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,411
- I know his wife.
- Ouch.

239
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,326
- I gotta fire Ken Cochran?
- Yes, sir.

240
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,609
Not because of the girl.

241
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:08,208
- Why not?
- I know his wife.

242
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:11,445
We can create legitimate grounds
for incompetence.

243
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:14,611
Looks to me like there
are legitimate grounds.

244
00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:18,249
- But come up with different ones.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:21,251
- All right, let's do it.
- Thank you.

246
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,852
Charlie!

247
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:28,281
- Yes, sir?
- I need to meet Ambassador Cochran.

248
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:31,969
He can be found
at the U.S. Embassy in Bulgaria.

249
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:35,762
Have the State Department
fly his ass here tomorrow.

250
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:37,686
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

251
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,003
- Is that Ken Cochran?
- Yeah.

252
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:42,365
- Okay.
- What?

253
00:17:42,613 --> 00:17:43,648
I'm sorry, sir?

254
00:17:43,893 --> 00:17:47,806
- It looked like you knew who he was.
- No, sir.

255
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:51,403
- Okay.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

256
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:56,083
They might put it on the table.

257
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,523
- They won't--
- They might.

258
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:02,049
- If they do put it on the table--
- They won't.

259
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:06,206
Is there any possibility
you'll let me finish a sentence?

260
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,842
You don't have to raise your voice.

261
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:13,609
- How the hell do you know if I am?
- I guessed.

262
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:17,607
Give me an argument
on English as the official language.

263
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:22,165
Don't speculate if the Republicans
put the issue on the table.

264
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,364
- Okay.
- Good.

265
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,488
- What'd she say?
- They won't.

266
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:29,166
Okay, look--

267
00:18:29,413 --> 00:18:32,644
Josh, C.J. started talking
about the drug memo.

268
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:35,202
The briefing's not till 11.

269
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:37,489
- Guess what?
- My watch sucks?

270
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,485
- Indeed.
- When I get back...

271
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,805
...we'll argue about
what I wanna argue about.

272
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:45,208
Do your best not to annoy me.

273
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:48,365
It's hard to believe
you're not married.

274
00:18:48,613 --> 00:18:50,285
Many have tried.

275
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,491
- Did Toby find a country?
- Micronesia.

276
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,212
Is that a real country?

277
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:59,366
It's southwest of Hawaii,
where you've never taken me.

278
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,843
When was I supposed to take you?

279
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:05,204
- Anytime. It's something bosses do.
- Micronesia?

280
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:09,492
They have the best scuba diving.
The mantas on Yap--

281
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,212
Stop talking now.

282
00:19:11,453 --> 00:19:14,889
<i>- -mandatory minimum sentencing</i>
<i>guidelines...</i>

283
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:18,250
<i>...applied to crack cocaine</i>
<i>are racist.</i>

284
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:22,771
A guy takes his assistant to Maui,
it's not unheard of.

285
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:24,292
- C.J.
- Hang on.

286
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:27,093
Mandatory minimums
require sentencing...

287
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,689
...anyone with five
grams of crack to five years.

288
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:35,290
It takes 100 times as much powder
cocaine to get that sentence.

289
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:40,288
70% of drug users are white.
80% of crack users are black.

290
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:44,128
Mandatory minimums for crack
are a war on the black community.

291
00:19:44,373 --> 00:19:47,206
Are you defending
the rights of drug users?

292
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,604
- Oh, please. Katie?
- Hang on, C.J., I asked--

293
00:19:50,853 --> 00:19:54,687
We are committed to reversing
the effects of drug abuse.

294
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:58,812
The best way is to treat
addiction as a medical problem.

295
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:04,366
We do not believe in a phony war
on drugs or killing black drug users.

296
00:20:04,613 --> 00:20:08,891
- C.J., are you aware--?
- Onorato says we support legalization?

297
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:14,082
Steve Onorato has a memo written
by the assistant surgeon general.

298
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,770
I'd be happy to produce similar memos
written for every president...

299
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:23,689
...in the last 30 years, including
four Republicans. That's all.

300
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:28,085
- There was no reason to snap at me.
- It was a ridiculous question.

301
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:31,086
We aren't crusading for drug
users' rights!

302
00:20:31,293 --> 00:20:36,970
I know, but don't count on everybody
understanding you when I can't.

303
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:41,365
You can't stay pissed at me.
Mandy's thing went away.

304
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,963
Is there really a need
to continue punishing me--?

305
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,488
Hang on.

306
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:56,681
- They talk about it here, Danny.
- And they blame you?

307
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:02,443
- They don't say it.
- But they blame you?

308
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:06,487
- Yes.
- And you think you've let them down?

309
00:21:09,293 --> 00:21:12,285
C.J., you're late
for the G-7 briefing.

310
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:15,093
- I have to go back to work.
- Okay.

311
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,890
- C.J.?
- Check in with the poll.

312
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:22,489
- I checked in a half-hour ago.
- Check again.

313
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,765
- Leo.
- Yeah?

314
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,162
C.J.'s here.

315
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:47,246
- Okay.
- Wanna hear a joke?

316
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:50,242
Okay.

317
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:53,809
Why do they only eat
one egg for breakfast in France?

318
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:57,409
Because in France,
one egg is <i>un oeuf.</i>

319
00:21:58,093 --> 00:22:01,768
- Okay, C.J.'s here.
- Okay.

320
00:22:05,773 --> 00:22:08,207
- Hi.
- Hey.

321
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:10,483
- The lid is on.
- You told me.

322
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:15,408
You called me and told me
it was a full lid.

323
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:20,926
Yeah. I'm gonna go to the phone banks,
check in with the poll.

324
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:26,244
- Okay.
- Leo, this is a small thing.

325
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:30,410
The president mentioned
that you told him...

326
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:34,202
...that everyone said
we'd hold steady at 42.

327
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,206
But I said we'd go up five points.

328
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:40,967
I meant on average.

329
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,489
Like lopping off the score
from the East German judge.

330
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:48,043
I think it's strange my take wasn't--

331
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:51,603
I'm saying,
don't read too much into it.

332
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:56,252
- All right?
- Okay.

333
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:57,962
Anything else?

334
00:22:59,373 --> 00:23:03,207
No. I'm gonna go
check the phone banks.

335
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:07,689
- Roosevelt said--
- Josh--

336
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,687
- The Republicans will bring it up.
- No, they won't.

337
00:23:15,893 --> 00:23:19,203
He said, "We have room
for but one language: English.

338
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:22,889
We intend to see
our people turn out as Americans...

339
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:26,085
...not as dwellers
in a polyglot boarding house."

340
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:30,491
- What kind?
- Polyglot, it means having knowledge--

341
00:23:30,733 --> 00:23:33,611
- I know what it means.
- Why did you ask?

342
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:37,163
- He asked you!
- Would the two of you shut up?

343
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,371
Or the three of you.
Could half of you stop?

344
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,451
Mandy's wound a bit tight
during polling.

345
00:23:43,693 --> 00:23:47,686
- What are you doing here?
- Another laid-back team member.

346
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:52,370
- Mandy's supposed to be here.
- What are you doing here?

347
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:55,041
I'm morale.
The calls are going great.

348
00:23:55,253 --> 00:24:00,008
I've got a deadline. You can't stand
here distracting the female callers.

349
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:04,083
Have I been distracting
the female callers?

350
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,251
- Even a little?
- That's it.

351
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:10,208
The window's fine,
they're making their quotas.

352
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:14,884
- Did he mention he's here for morale?
- And as such, I'm getting coffee.

353
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:18,722
A hundred volts of caffeine
is what the doctor ordered.

354
00:24:18,893 --> 00:24:24,411
You should've been more impressed
that I was able to quote Roosevelt.

355
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,809
I was impressed
you knew what polyglot meant.

356
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:32,011
760 SAT word, baby.

357
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,408
You are both drunk and disorderly.

358
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:48,689
- Oh, my God.
- Happy graduation.

359
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:50,651
- How did you--?
- Surprise!

360
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,526
- We worked in cahoots.
- You planned this?

361
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:58,204
- This is why you dragged me back here.
- Are you glad?

362
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:01,843
Well, then, be quiet.
And I'll be upstairs.

363
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:06,612
- Good night, Janeane.
- Good night, Janeane.

364
00:25:09,653 --> 00:25:12,167
- What'd you get me?
- Graduation gift.

365
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:15,729
Is it a briefcase?
Did I just ruin it?

366
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:22,281
I ask because it's a typical gift.
I don't mean boring, I mean basic.

367
00:25:22,493 --> 00:25:25,690
When I say basic,
I don't mean boring, either.

368
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:29,009
Open the box.

369
00:25:32,453 --> 00:25:35,092
- You bought me a pen.
- It's a good one.

370
00:25:35,293 --> 00:25:41,209
- You can use that pen in outer space.
- Where's my present?

371
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:51,290
- Happy graduation, counsel.
- Thank you.

372
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:01,250
- Way to go, Laurie.
- Thank you.

373
00:26:03,013 --> 00:26:05,925
I have to go.
You spend the night here, or--

374
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:09,006
I'm gonna go upstairs. She's got a--

375
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,006
Did you see anybody get in that car?

376
00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,249
- He'll see us.
- What'd he say?

377
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:41,122
- "Get your ass over here."
- I wrote a letter of resignation.

378
00:26:41,373 --> 00:26:45,764
That would deny me the pleasure
of throwing you out of a window.

379
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:50,165
- You have every right to say that.
- I should keep you on a leash.

380
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,563
I'm talking to C.J., then to you.

381
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:56,647
I'd bolt you to your desk
and have someone feed you.

382
00:26:56,853 --> 00:27:00,323
The president referred
to the NASDAQ Composite...

383
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:03,252
...not the 30-year Treasury Yield.

384
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:07,611
Not the Dow Industrials,
the NASDAQ Composite.

385
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:10,606
Someone here
is gonna get back to you.

386
00:27:10,773 --> 00:27:16,006
- How do you not tell me until now?
- We didn't know anything last night.

387
00:27:16,173 --> 00:27:19,006
- Sam called you.
- He saw a suspicious car.

388
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:23,041
I'm not gonna call at night
because someone started a car.

389
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:28,851
I was handling it. It took me three
hours to confirm there was a picture.

390
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,806
- Who has it?
- The <i>London Daily Mirror.</i>

391
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:37,047
They paid a friend of hers $50,000
to confirm that she was a call girl.

392
00:27:37,213 --> 00:27:38,441
When's it running?

393
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:42,771
Later today. American press
has it tomorrow morning.

394
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:46,448
- He was giving her a present?
- Yeah.

395
00:27:46,693 --> 00:27:49,651
- Work the <i>Post</i> and the <i>Times.</i>
- Yeah.

396
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:52,603
- You never paid her for sex?
- No.

397
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:57,881
- They had sex once. He didn't know.
- That makes two of us.

398
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:02,086
Sam's always been aboveboard
about his relationship with Laurie.

399
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,811
- Laurie's the girl?
- Yes.

400
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,851
He told us about it
after his first contact.

401
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:11,325
Her putting herself through
law school has to mean something.

402
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,885
- And Sam's word is unimpeachable.
- Are you sticking up for Sam?

403
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:20,012
I know it's strange,
but I'm feeling a certain...

404
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:26,804
...big-brotherly connection right now.
Obviously, I want it to go away soon.

405
00:28:27,013 --> 00:28:33,202
But now we should stand by Sam and
go after the people who set him up.

406
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:41,570
Sam, you're gonna spend the morning
finding out if you broke any laws.

407
00:28:41,813 --> 00:28:45,010
- Call the girl. What's her name?
- Laurie.

408
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:51,010
Tell her the White House regrets
the inconvenience she'll experience.

409
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:56,611
And that she probably has a cause
of action against the paper.

410
00:28:56,773 --> 00:29:01,210
Tell her if she passes her bar exam,
the U.S. Attorney General...

411
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:04,928
...will personally see
that she's admitted to the bar.

412
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:09,570
Tell her the president says
congratulations on getting her degree.

413
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:13,810
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

414
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:17,922
Thank you, Mr. President.

415
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:26,844
It's nice when we can do something
for prostitutes once in a while.

416
00:29:27,053 --> 00:29:28,771
- Mr. President.
- Ready?

417
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:31,208
Cochran's in the Mural Room.

418
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:34,251
- Where are we putting Lobell?
- Roosevelt Room.

419
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:38,088
He has a lot of staff.
I don't know what they do...

420
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:41,802
...but there they are.
Wherever Lobell goes, 15 guys.

421
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:44,886
I'm gonna take care of this first.

422
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,089
- Who's in the Mural Room?
- Cochran.

423
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,811
- You did it again.
- Sir?

424
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:53,444
You said it like you knew him.
I have a sense about these things.

425
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:56,247
- Finely honed.
- It's failing you, sir.

426
00:29:56,493 --> 00:30:01,521
Cochran's in the Mural Room?
Sit with him and send in Ted Mitchel.

427
00:30:01,773 --> 00:30:05,846
- Mr. President?
- Yes, of course. Thanks.

428
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:08,243
- Ted!
- Mr. President.

429
00:30:08,413 --> 00:30:10,643
- Thanks for coming.
- My pleasure.

430
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:14,522
- You're looking good. How's Mary?
- She sends her love.

431
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:18,448
- Let me tell you that I need a favor.
- Of course.

432
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:20,490
- I need you to hire a guy.
- Who?

433
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,447
The former ambassador to Bulgaria.
Ken Cochran.

434
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:26,689
Isn't he the current ambassador?

435
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:31,330
Not for long. He's a good man.
He'd be a good corporate officer.

436
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:35,606
- Why is he being fired?
- Gross incompetence. I'll be back.

437
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:39,566
- Morning, sir.
- Nancy.

438
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:43,249
- Lobell's in the Roosevelt Room.
- Be right in.

439
00:30:43,453 --> 00:30:45,569
Mr. President. Good to see you.

440
00:30:45,773 --> 00:30:49,607
- Thank you for flying in.
- Of course, Mr. President.

441
00:30:50,893 --> 00:30:54,010
- What can I do for you?
- Resign.

442
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:55,362
Excuse me?

443
00:30:55,573 --> 00:30:59,930
You had an affair with the prime
minister's daughter. That won't work.

444
00:31:00,093 --> 00:31:04,803
Neither does a newspaper article
saying you're having an affair.

445
00:31:05,013 --> 00:31:08,642
You're gonna get a job offer
for a lot more money.

446
00:31:08,853 --> 00:31:11,811
That's why you left the embassy.
I'll be back.

447
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:20,608
Well, this is outrageous.

448
00:31:23,653 --> 00:31:27,805
- I'll tell him when he comes back in.
- Yes, sir.

449
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:32,405
- Have we met?
- Sir?

450
00:31:32,893 --> 00:31:35,088
You look familiar. Have we met?

451
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:38,325
- Yes, sir.
- Where?

452
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,809
I was a waiter
at the Gramercy Club.

453
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:45,723
- Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

454
00:31:47,813 --> 00:31:49,769
- Charlie!
- Yes, sir.

455
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:53,642
- It's good to see you again.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:58,606
Under strained circumstances,
which I'll explain.

457
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:04,612
- I resigned my membership.
- Did you?

458
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:08,163
Yeah. I find exclusive clubs
to be repugnant.

459
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:11,485
It didn't stop you from joining up.

460
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:15,612
Now, that's out of line.
That shouldn't have been said.

461
00:32:16,013 --> 00:32:20,325
- You're addressing a U.S. ambassador.
- I apologize, sir.

462
00:32:20,573 --> 00:32:25,328
I'm sorry to do this, but I'd like
to speak to your supervisor.

463
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:29,327
I'm personal aide to the president.
My supervisor's busy...

464
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,331
...looking for a back door
to shove you out of.

465
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:35,246
I'll let him know
you'd like to complain.

466
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,648
- Thanks for waiting.
- Mr. President.

467
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:43,364
Clearly, this young man has told you
about our past, and I'd like to--

468
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:46,764
That doesn't have anything to do--
Wait a second.

469
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:51,324
You two have a past?
You mocked my finely honed sense.

470
00:32:51,573 --> 00:32:55,248
You stood there in my face--
It's done, Ken.

471
00:32:55,413 --> 00:32:58,610
Ted Mitchel will put you
on the board of directors.

472
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:04,291
Remember, I like your wife. I would
hate to see her be made a fool of.

473
00:33:06,893 --> 00:33:11,842
I think it would be appropriate
now to make a confession.

474
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:15,443
- What's that?
- I never voted for you.

475
00:33:17,013 --> 00:33:21,803
Well, thanks for trying,
but here I am anyway. Gotta go.

476
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:27,247
- All set?
- Look, 14 staffers.

477
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:32,328
- You have a large staff too.
- But I don't walk around with them.

478
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:35,405
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

479
00:33:35,573 --> 00:33:38,804
Allow me to introduce
Bob Simon, Peter--

480
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:43,205
Max, I don't need to know
all the names. Please sit.

481
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:47,764
- All right.
- You know what we're doing here?

482
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,406
- Talking about soft money.
- We'll do more than talk.

483
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:53,642
Okay.

484
00:33:53,853 --> 00:33:57,448
- We agree on nothing, Max.
- Yes, sir.

485
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:00,292
Education, guns,
school prayer, gays...

486
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:04,492
...defense spending, taxes.
You name it, we disagree.

487
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:07,571
- You know why?
- Because I'm a lily-livered...

488
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:09,724
...bleeding heart communist.

489
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:13,966
Yes, sir. And I'm a gun-toting,
redneck son of a bitch.

490
00:34:14,213 --> 00:34:17,011
- Yes, you are.
- We agree on that.

491
00:34:17,213 --> 00:34:21,445
- We also agree on campaign finance.
- Yes, sir.

492
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:25,402
So, Max, let's work together
on campaign finance.

493
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:28,724
- You don't have House votes.
- I don't need them.

494
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,245
1978, the FEC voted a rule
that opened the door to soft money.

495
00:34:33,493 --> 00:34:37,008
The FEC can close it again
with four of the six votes.

496
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:39,403
How will you get the four votes?

497
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:43,322
Two seats opened up,
I nominated Bacon and Calhoun.

498
00:34:43,493 --> 00:34:45,131
That's two.

499
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,848
Haskel is with us,
we took him out of the closet.

500
00:34:49,013 --> 00:34:52,801
- How'll you get the fourth?
- Toby'll take care of that.

501
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:58,610
Max, can I count on your support
to confirm my candidates?

502
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:02,204
And what do I get in exchange?

503
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:07,410
The thanks of a grateful president.

504
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:13,407
Good answer, sir.

505
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:17,004
Go.

506
00:35:18,613 --> 00:35:20,126
Thank you.

507
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,732
Mr. Kassenbach.

508
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,929
- Toby Ziegler.
- Nice to meet you.

509
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:28,927
The president thinks you've done
a great job on the FEC...

510
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,688
- ...and extends his congratulations.
- On what?

511
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:39,207
On being named the next ambassador
to the Federated States of Micronesia.

512
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,604
It's in.

513
00:35:55,173 --> 00:35:57,323
- Yeah.
- You talk to them?

514
00:35:57,533 --> 00:36:01,208
They sealed it in an envelope,
sent it by courier.

515
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:06,649
- So Joey mentioned she talked to you.
- Yeah.

516
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:10,010
She said you think there are
only so many times...

517
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:13,802
...you can walk into the Oval Office
and sing a song.

518
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:19,447
- She said "sing a song"?
- That's what I thought she said.

519
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:23,811
I'm trying to learn sign.
We're using letters of the alphabet.

520
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:28,404
Turns out she said you think
there are only so many times...

521
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:32,845
- ...you can say you're wrong.
- He hasn't called my number much.

522
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:36,403
He did on this.
The media strategy was yours.

523
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:40,407
Holding at 42 is good.
You shouldn't expect a 5-point bump.

524
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:43,446
- I do expect that.
- Okay.

525
00:36:47,453 --> 00:36:50,445
He thinks of you
like a daughter, C.J.

526
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:53,890
That's not a good enough reason
to keep me here.

527
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,811
- You'll come when you get it?
- Yeah.

528
00:36:59,053 --> 00:37:02,409
- Because we're all waiting over there.
- Yeah.

529
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:21,685
They're delivering it to her?
And she's gonna bring it right here?

530
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:23,525
Okay.

531
00:37:31,173 --> 00:37:32,811
Thank you.

532
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:36,207
Kassenbach was okay?

533
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:41,611
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Kassenbach was okay?

534
00:37:42,573 --> 00:37:45,804
He's gonna be an ambassador.
He feels pretty good.

535
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:51,012
- Did you tell him about the weather?
- Yes, sir.

536
00:37:52,133 --> 00:37:56,763
- Scuba diving?
- Yes, sir.

537
00:37:56,973 --> 00:38:00,204
- Full diplomatic immunity?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:38:00,453 --> 00:38:03,889
Though there aren't
a lot of laws in Micronesia.

539
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,771
Sure.

540
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:08,652
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Josh.

541
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:13,689
I just saw C.J.
She'll be here in a minute.

542
00:38:19,893 --> 00:38:23,488
Joey and I are working on
a counter to de Tocqueville.

543
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:27,726
- We're having a fight with him?
- Don't get him started.

544
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:33,530
Joey, what say you to the position
that with ethnic warfare spreading...

545
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,406
...it will eventually
reach our shores...

546
00:38:36,653 --> 00:38:39,611
...and making English
our official language...

547
00:38:39,773 --> 00:38:45,803
...safeguards our national identity
and avoids ethnic strife?

548
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,806
That's what I deal with.

549
00:38:51,013 --> 00:38:56,007
72% of Hispanics are strongly
opposed to such a law.

550
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:59,331
The Republicans won't
put it on the table.

551
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:03,043
They'll lose the second-largest
ethnic bloc of voters.

552
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:08,128
But if you need a counterargument,
I'd say to Monsieur de Tocqueville...

553
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:13,202
...aside from being unconstitutional,
no laws need to be created...

554
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:16,092
...to protect the language
of Shakespeare.

555
00:39:16,293 --> 00:39:20,809
That's all I was looking for.
That one line took you four days.

556
00:39:21,293 --> 00:39:23,568
- She did it again.
- Yeah.

557
00:39:39,413 --> 00:39:42,086
What kind of briefcase
did you get her, Sam?

558
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:45,882
- Sir?
- What kind of briefcase?

559
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:49,810
Coach Beekman in British tan
with brass hardware.

560
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:52,044
- That's nice.
- Yes, sir.

561
00:39:52,293 --> 00:39:57,048
Andara makes a nice model.
Comes in black or brown...

562
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,410
...hand-stained.
You can fit a laptop--

563
00:40:00,613 --> 00:40:02,604
This conversation is surreal.

564
00:40:02,853 --> 00:40:06,050
Trieste in Milan
makes a nice briefcase.

565
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:26,213
The polling book is 400 pages long,
and it's still being put together.

566
00:40:26,373 --> 00:40:30,525
- I have the top sheet results.
- What does it say?

567
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:37,644
I was wrong.
We went up nine points.

568
00:40:54,133 --> 00:40:56,124
Okay, what's next?

569
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:59,809
We should talk about
the new projections....

570
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:48,722
