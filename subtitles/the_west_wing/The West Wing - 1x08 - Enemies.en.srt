1
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:08,915
<i>Previously on</i> The West Wing:

2
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:12,122
C.J., I've got my own press secretary.

3
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:15,641
When she tells you something,
it's from this office.

4
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:19,923
Where do you get the authority
to direct me to the men's room?

5
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:24,159
- Bring Sam Seaborn.
- Sam has enough without a booty call.

6
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,724
It's not a booty call.

7
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:30,401
- Do you flirt with me to get a story?
- I'm doing it to flirt with you.

8
00:00:30,565 --> 00:00:32,521
Jenny's asking for a divorce.

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:35,483
- You're kidding me.
- No.

10
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:47,681
Yellowstone was the nation's
first national park. March 1, 1872.

11
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:50,279
It's getting late. Are we through?

12
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:53,283
We're through with work.
But this part's fun.

13
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:58,844
- Which part?
- Where I get to teach you something.

14
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:01,236
- You're not tired?
- No.

15
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:06,035
- Perhaps if you got into bed--
- I'm a national park buff, Josh.

16
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,353
- I'm sorry?
- I'm a national park buff.

17
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:14,360
- I bet you didn't know that about me.
- I didn't, but I'm not surprised.

18
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:19,280
- Why is that?
- You're quite a nerd, Mr. President.

19
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:21,993
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

20
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:26,323
- That was said with respect?
- Yes, sir.

21
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,921
Is it nerd-like to know
Everglades National Park is...

22
00:01:30,085 --> 00:01:36,035
...the largest subtropical wilderness
in the U.S. and has mangrove forests?

23
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:39,282
- Just a little.
- There are 54 national parks.

24
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:44,121
- You've been to all of them?
- I have. I should show you my slides.

25
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:46,241
- Would you?
- Grand Canyon...

26
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:50,478
...Bryce Canyon, Badlands. Capitol
Reef, Acadia, often overlooked.

27
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,922
Feel free to keep talking,
but I need to go...

28
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:57,441
...so I can be in my office
in four hours.

29
00:01:57,645 --> 00:02:00,876
- Dry Tortugas?
- I can't go until you give permission.

30
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:07,160
Petrified Forest, Cascades, Joshua
Tree. Shenandoah, here in Virginia!

31
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,681
We should organize
a staff field trip to Shenandoah.

32
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:13,484
I could be the guide.
What do you think?

33
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:17,843
- A good place to dump your body.
- What was that?

34
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:23,080
- Did I say that out loud?
- And I was gonna let you go home.

35
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:27,159
- But instead?
- We're gonna talk about Yosemite.

36
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:17,836
Thank you.
- Thanks, Tony.

37
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,080
Let me pay.
- No.

38
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:20,837
I said I was taking you out.

39
00:03:21,045 --> 00:03:24,037
- But this is my hotel, Mallory.
- Dad.

40
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:28,881
- How much is a cup of coffee here?
- $6.50.

41
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,758
- You want to pay the check?
- No.

42
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,880
- $6.50?
- Yes.

43
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,193
- You haven't told me about your mom.
- Dad.

44
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:42,998
- Leo?
- Congressman Skinner.

45
00:03:43,605 --> 00:03:46,244
- You know my daughter?
- How are you?

46
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,801
- Good to see you.
- Congrats.

47
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:51,433
- To all of us.
- Right.

48
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:55,393
The banking bill's gonna pass?
Congratulations.

49
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:59,314
Thank you. You haven't
told me about your mother.

50
00:04:00,085 --> 00:04:03,634
- What do you want to know?
- Is she...?

51
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:08,515
I don't know. Tell me anything.

52
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:12,803
- You could call and ask how she is.
- Or I could just ask you.

53
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:17,595
- But asking me won't do any good.
- I'm getting that impression.

54
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:21,036
- What's that?
- Opera tickets. It's our subscription.

55
00:04:21,245 --> 00:04:23,076
- Mom doesn't want them?
- No.

56
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:25,076
- Did you ask her?
- Yes.

57
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:29,204
While you were asking that,
you couldn't ask how she's doing?

58
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:32,078
I had a chance to give you up
for adoption.

59
00:04:32,245 --> 00:04:34,122
Too late.

60
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:39,279
- Why can't you say congratulations?
- On the banking bill? I did.

61
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:44,434
- You were smirking, rolling your eyes.
- I was doing neither.

62
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:49,360
- You were doing it with your voice.
- Father, you've gone 'round the bend.

63
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:52,364
- Want the tickets?
- Yes.

64
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:55,114
You wanna walk me back to work?

65
00:04:56,405 --> 00:04:57,838
Sure.

66
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:10,802
Till 2 a.m.?
- Yes.

67
00:05:10,965 --> 00:05:16,039
- Talking about national parks?
- The president was talking.

68
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,275
- We beat the banking lobby!
- It'll pass?

69
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,434
We beat them.

70
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,594
- You're confident?
- Yes.

71
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:23,882
Did you and Josh talk
till 2 a.m. about parks?

72
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:26,719
- Everglades Park--
- Mr. President.

73
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:29,479
- I've got to take this so I can gloat.
- Enjoy yourself.

74
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,796
- Talk about this today. This is it!
- Yes, sir.

75
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,794
By the way, the California live oak--

76
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:37,284
- Mr. President.
- Right.

77
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:41,438
- Have a good day.
- Twelfth-round knockout, C.J. !

78
00:05:50,845 --> 00:05:54,042
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Vice President.

79
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:59,484
Let's take our seats. President's gonna
be late, and he wanted me to start.

80
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:05,123
I welcome you to our third cabinet
meeting. Our first in six months.

81
00:06:05,285 --> 00:06:08,038
The president would want me
to point out...

82
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:12,642
...these meetings offer a chance
to come together, exchange ideas...

83
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,444
...and discuss our goals
for the future.

84
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:20,679
Surely our first goal has to be
finding a way to work with Congress.

85
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:23,883
We need to reach out
to the House and to--

86
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:27,435
Morning, Mr. President.
Mr. President.

87
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:32,238
This is the saddest-looking cabinet--
Look at this.

88
00:06:32,445 --> 00:06:37,041
I have an agriculture secretary
who's never eaten a vegetable.

89
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,839
Sit down. You're freaking me out.
Morning, Leo.

90
00:06:40,005 --> 00:06:41,040
Good morning, sir.

91
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:42,399
- Are you taking minutes?
- Yes, sir.

92
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:43,634
What's your name?

93
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:47,798
- Mildred, sir.
- I'm the president. What'd I miss?

94
00:06:48,005 --> 00:06:51,122
The vice president.
"President's gonna be late--"

95
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:53,641
Would you skip down?

96
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:58,396
"The president would want me to point
out these meetings are a chance--"

97
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:02,160
Actually, I find these meetings
to be mind-numbing...

98
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:06,762
...but Leo tells me they're required,
so let's get it over with.

99
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:10,480
"Our first goal is finding
a way to work with Congress."

100
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:13,245
- Who said that?
- I did.

101
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:17,959
Our first goal should be finding
a way to work with Congress?

102
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,114
Yes, sir.

103
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:24,845
You don't think our first goal is to
find a way to best serve the people?

104
00:07:25,525 --> 00:07:27,402
I didn't say that.

105
00:07:28,005 --> 00:07:32,078
Really? Let's have a look.

106
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:36,640
That's what it says here.
Want Mildred to read it again?

107
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:40,444
- No. Thank you, sir.
- Okay.

108
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,078
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

109
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:46,635
Good.
Now, let's get to work.

110
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:57,082
- It's good. It's a little flat.
- Yeah. I think so too.

111
00:07:57,325 --> 00:08:00,840
- My writing's been flat lately.
- It's not you, it's me.

112
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:04,441
- You did the best you could.
- What do you mean?

113
00:08:04,645 --> 00:08:07,478
- You reached your potential.
- I can do better.

114
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,636
- I can too.
- You saying I can't?

115
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,080
I'm saying you're fine and I'm flat.

116
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:14,679
- What is it?
We can't find our talent.

117
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,519
Heard anything
about the banking bill?

118
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:20,882
- What do you mean?
- I'm hearing some stuff.

119
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,478
- We're fine.
- You sure?

120
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:25,000
- I'm having lunch with Crane.
- When?

121
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:26,678
Lunchtime.

122
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:30,121
- I shouldn't be nervous?
- No.

123
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,480
Okay.

124
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:37,674
- It couldn't have gone far, right?
- No.

125
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:42,282
Somewhere in this building
is our talent.

126
00:08:42,485 --> 00:08:44,476
Yes.

127
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,277
C.J.
- Danny.

128
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:50,437
- How are you?
- How is it my staff lets you in?

129
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:54,075
- They like me.
- They're supposed to like me.

130
00:08:54,285 --> 00:08:57,277
- What do you need?
- The president roughed up Hoynes.

131
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,514
- From who?
- Whom.

132
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:01,404
- Where'd you hear it?
- Got 50 cents?

133
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:04,244
Read about it in my paper.
Want to have dinner?

134
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:07,437
- No. Tell me more.
- Did it happen?

135
00:09:07,605 --> 00:09:10,677
- On the record? Absolutely not.
- Off the record?

136
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:14,235
- What else is new?
- I thought so. Have dinner with me.

137
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:20,759
I'm good-looking. People don't notice
right away. I like seafood.

138
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,000
Danny.

139
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,554
I'm a good conversationalist
and good at kayaking.

140
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:26,477
- I can't.
- I can teach you.

141
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:30,473
No, you idiot,
I mean I can't have dinner.

142
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:32,443
Okay.

143
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:40,595
Yesterday at 10:00,
these two guys, as a joke...

144
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:44,644
...posted false information
about a tiny start-up company...

145
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,443
...and its stock shot up.

146
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:50,439
By 2:30, the hoax had been uncovered
and the stock adjusted.

147
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:56,078
But by the end of the day, this
company which nobody had heard of...

148
00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:00,477
...closed out as the 12th highest
traded issue on the NASDAQ.

149
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:03,279
This just in:
The Internet is not a fad.

150
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:05,720
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, all.

151
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,558
- Mr. Vice President?
- What do you need?

152
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:11,558
The cabinet meeting?
Anything to talk about?

153
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:16,594
Talk about? I've had dreams about
killing you. What does that mean?

154
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:19,723
- I heard about the meeting.
- Nothing happened.

155
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,762
- I heard different.
- You heard wrong.

156
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,041
- Okay.
- Let's go!

157
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:28,634
- Sam?
- Yeah.

158
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:32,764
Heard about the cabinet meeting?
The president took Hoynes for a ride.

159
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,836
- Who's talking?
- I don't know.

160
00:10:35,005 --> 00:10:38,202
Hi, Mallory.
Let me know if you hear anything.

161
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:39,878
Hi.
- How you doing?

162
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:44,197
Pretty good. I had breakfast with
my father and walked him back.

163
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:47,402
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Sure.

164
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:54,200
- What's up?
- So....

165
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:57,914
Here's the thing.
Do you by any chance like opera?

166
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,038
- The opera?
- Yes.

167
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,763
To go and watch and listen to?

168
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,842
- Yes, Sam.
- Why do you ask?

169
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:08,874
I have two tickets to the Beijing
Opera tonight at the Kennedy Center.

170
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:10,239
My father's seats.

171
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,157
- Beijing Opera?
- Yes.

172
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,154
- You're asking me on a date.
- No.

173
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:17,793
I'm asking you if you'd like to go...

174
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:22,641
...to see a renowned opera company
perform a work native to its culture.

175
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:25,114
Right. In what way
will it not be a date?

176
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:30,040
There will be no sex for you
at the end of the evening.

177
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:31,354
Okay.

178
00:11:31,965 --> 00:11:35,275
- So what do you say?
- Well....

179
00:11:35,485 --> 00:11:38,045
I am an absolute nut
for Chinese opera.

180
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:41,754
The Chinese being known
for their romantic melodies.

181
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:45,554
With your guarantee there won't
be sex, I can't say no.

182
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:46,959
Good, then.

183
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,434
- I'll come and get you at 7:30.
- Yeah.

184
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,482
Know what's good about this?

185
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:54,284
If you hadn't offered
opera and no sex...

186
00:11:54,485 --> 00:11:59,115
...all I'd be doing later is watching
football, so this works out great.

187
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,560
- 7:30.
- Yes, indeed.

188
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:20,440
- Leo will be in in a minute.
- Thanks.

189
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,442
- What's your thing about?
- Nothing.

190
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,637
- What's your thing about?
- Nothing.

191
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:39,474
- What do you need?
- We're not here together.

192
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,444
Somebody go first.

193
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:45,674
Concanon heard the president
and Hoynes--

194
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:49,679
- The cabinet meeting? It's nothing.
- Then why is he asking?

195
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:51,437
- Who talked?
- He won't say.

196
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,357
- It's Hoynes.
- We need that.

197
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:55,595
- What should I do?
- Deal with it.

198
00:12:55,765 --> 00:12:58,563
You're a real details man,
aren't you, Leo?

199
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:01,000
Deal with it.

200
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:05,683
What do you want?

201
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:09,042
- I can come back another--
- What?

202
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:14,755
Mallory had an extra ticket to
the opera and she asked me to go.

203
00:13:14,925 --> 00:13:18,474
- Mallory who?
- Mallory, your daughter.

204
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,920
- Mallory, my daughter...
- Yes.

205
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:28,478
...asked you to the opera with tickets
belonging to me and her mother?

206
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:34,242
- The woman who used to be my wife?
- We won't be doing anything.

207
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,794
- Like what?
- Let's stay away from that.

208
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:40,674
- Best that we do. I'm fine.
- You're fine. You're sure?

209
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:43,837
- Somebody should use them.
- Thank you.

210
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,315
- Go back to work, Sam.
- Yeah.

211
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:53,358
I'm fine.

212
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,523
Nitrogen and hydrogen.

213
00:13:56,685 --> 00:14:01,122
Dick Brenner says we send a rocket
with a liquid hydrogen payload...

214
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:05,722
...when we can put a man on Mars
for $25 billion? That's a steal.

215
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:08,638
Where do you get nitrogen
to get him back?

216
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,878
Mars is made out of nitrogen.
We'll build a gas station.

217
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:17,755
We're done. Maybe we should all take
a science course. Thank you, all.

218
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,200
C.J. Cregg asked for a minute.

219
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:22,925
- I could've seen that coming.
- Mr. Vice President.

220
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,758
Whoever Danny's been
talking to, it wasn't me.

221
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:29,281
I'd just like to keep it
from becoming a story.

222
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,798
What can I do?

223
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:33,684
What happened
and how did Danny find out?

224
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:37,474
Nothing happened,
and I have no idea how he found out.

225
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:43,402
The implication I leaked information
is as stupid as it is insulting.

226
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:48,036
I'd like to remind you whatever regard
you hold for me personally...

227
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:51,675
...you are addressing
the office of the vice president.

228
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:53,563
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?

229
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:57,843
- No, sir.
- Good. Let's go.

230
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,683
- Let's go.
- What's up?

231
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:07,962
- Banking bill's gonna pass.
- Crane's sure?

232
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,638
- Said it was in the bag.
- How was lunch?

233
00:15:09,805 --> 00:15:11,682
- In the bag.
- No, it's not.

234
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,564
- I just got done with Crane.
- He's behind.

235
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,397
- What?
- What'd they attach?

236
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:18,044
- A land use rider.
Who?

237
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,924
- Broderick and Eaton.
- Broderick and Eaton?

238
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:26,364
Big Sky Federal Reserve.
They want to strip-mine Montana.

239
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,277
- We don't care.
- We do care!

240
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:31,278
Not today.
Since when are you outdoorsy?

241
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:36,235
- This is about retribution.
- Yeah, no kidding.

242
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,239
We need to see the president.

243
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:43,199
Yeah, we need to see the president.

244
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:46,038
- Broderick and Eaton?
- Yes.

245
00:15:50,725 --> 00:15:56,436
I can only say the president was
interested in the policy's effects.

246
00:15:56,605 --> 00:16:01,076
But the White House is optimistic
about the chances of the bill?

247
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:04,476
- Very.
- You're not concerned about the rider?

248
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:05,714
Sorry?

249
00:16:05,885 --> 00:16:09,002
You're not concerned
about the rider attachment?

250
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:12,555
It's being worked out.
I'll go into detail later.

251
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:16,400
- Could you do it now?
- Then you won't need me later.

252
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:19,881
- C.J.--
- Later. Thank you, everybody.

253
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:27,394
- Bonnie, find Toby.
- Land use rider was a shock.

254
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:30,398
This is a restricted area.
There are signs.

255
00:16:30,565 --> 00:16:32,635
- Where?
- There are usually signs.

256
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,602
- You guys mind me back here?
No.

257
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:38,804
- Seems someone took your legs out.
- First, you're wrong.

258
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:43,993
Second, shut up. Third, Hoynes says he
didn't talk to you and I believe him.

259
00:16:44,165 --> 00:16:47,282
He's pissed at me.
Fourth, shut up again!

260
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:50,278
- It wasn't Hoynes.
- I know that now.

261
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:54,996
I enjoy movies, music. I'm not wild
about ice skating, but I'll do it.

262
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,564
- Say goodbye to Danny.
Bye.

263
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,716
A day's work for a day's pay.

264
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:02,116
Toby's in his office.
Should I say you're coming?

265
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:05,641
- No, I'd like to keep this a surprise.
- Never mind.

266
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:08,399
- Big Sky Federal Reserve.
- In Montana?

267
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:09,833
What happened?

268
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:13,077
Eaton and Broderick got
a rider into the report.

269
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:16,999
Eaton and Broderick
attached the land use rider?

270
00:17:17,165 --> 00:17:20,043
Surprised they're interested
in strip-mining?

271
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,197
I'm surprised
they're interested in anything.

272
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:25,959
It's retaliatory, sir.
For the campaign.

273
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:29,162
- What did I do during the campaign?
- You won.

274
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:31,839
- They want to strip-mine Big Sky?
- Mr. President.

275
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,404
- Swallow it.
- I knew it.

276
00:17:33,605 --> 00:17:36,199
- It's the right thing.
- It's not!

277
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:37,963
Over here, please.

278
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,764
The banking reform bill
is the ball game.

279
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:46,636
Let's not get into a contest over
rocks uninhabitable most of the year.

280
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:48,517
They're attractive rocks.

281
00:17:48,685 --> 00:17:51,882
Sam meant we don't need
the environmental lobby.

282
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:56,994
That's not what I meant. What I meant
is, it'll save real people real money.

283
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:59,520
- Tough.
- What do you do?

284
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:01,483
- Veto it.
- It's our bill.

285
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:06,395
He's right. Send a signal to the banks
that we will not be held hostage.

286
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:10,478
Tell them we'd rather be held hostage
by wildlife activists.

287
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:12,795
That position always works.

288
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:17,880
And it's important we carry Montana
and its three electoral votes.

289
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:22,721
I knew Sam would sell off states.
I was hoping he'd start with Delaware.

290
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:25,797
- Toby?
- Let me speak to some people.

291
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,193
Leo?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:27,405 --> 00:18:30,681
I don't like these people, Toby.
I don't want to lose.

293
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,996
- Yes, sir.
- What's next?

294
00:18:47,645 --> 00:18:49,078
- Hey.
- Hey.

295
00:18:49,285 --> 00:18:52,880
- Don't get up. It's fine.
- Did you need something?

296
00:18:53,045 --> 00:18:56,515
- I came to see what you were doing.
- No appointments?

297
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:00,440
The night was blocked,
but the thing got canceled.

298
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,641
- Take the night off, sir.
- No.

299
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:06,559
- I've still got 400 pages to read.
- Leave it till tomorrow.

300
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,558
I don't like being there with no one.

301
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:14,435
- Call Abbey, turn on the football game.
- Maybe later.

302
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:15,680
Okay.

303
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:21,883
- You had breakfast with Mal?
- Yep.

304
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:23,683
How's she doing?

305
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:26,837
- She's pissed at me.
- You ignored her mother.

306
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:30,475
- Come on.
- That's what it looks like to her.

307
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,205
- But she sees the job.
- No, she doesn't.

308
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:38,519
Anyone would have to see it to believe
it. And if they did, would it matter?

309
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:42,439
She's her mother's daughter,
and you made her mother cry.

310
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:47,036
You really threw some sunshine
down on that one. Thank you, sir.

311
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:50,273
I'm right next door all night.

312
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:52,441
Me too.

313
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,676
Okay.

314
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:06,879
- Josh?
- Yeah.

315
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:09,559
- Mandy wants to see you.
- Can you tell her I'm not in?

316
00:20:09,725 --> 00:20:13,843
No, I think the ship's sailed
on that one.

317
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:18,876
How you doing?

318
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,754
Let me say this. It's a good bill.

319
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:26,759
- The banking bill is a good bill.
- And it works for us.

320
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:31,840
No more 24% credit card interest,
more savings than a tax cut...

321
00:20:32,045 --> 00:20:35,879
...no unjustified holds on deposits.
These I can work with.

322
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:39,555
I have no argument!
But when they could strip-mine--

323
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:43,280
You never climbed a tree.
You don't care about Big Sky.

324
00:20:43,485 --> 00:20:47,273
I don't. I do care about
hanging a sign that says:

325
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:53,276
"Republicans and Congress, feel free
to slap us around to show us you can."

326
00:20:53,445 --> 00:20:57,404
- You don't like Broderick and Eaton.
- That's not the point.

327
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:59,715
- It is the point.
- How?

328
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:05,437
When you're competitive and combative,
you juice up the president.

329
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:11,795
- I'll keep that in mind.
- No, you won't. You never do.

330
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:15,321
- Josh?
- Yeah. Gotta run.

331
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:21,354
I'm not done with you.

332
00:21:23,845 --> 00:21:26,234
Thanks, Liz.

333
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,877
Excuse me, Mr. McGarry?

334
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:32,685
- Call me Leo, will you?
- I'll try.

335
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:35,353
- What do you need?
- Message from Nancy Becker.

336
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:38,881
Tomorrow is the transportation
secretary's birthday.

337
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:41,513
The president usually sends a letter.

338
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:44,882
Yeah. Tell Communications.
They'll give it to a staffer.

339
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,922
Yes, sir.

340
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:49,036
Wait.

341
00:21:49,245 --> 00:21:52,920
- Nancy Becker needs it tonight?
- Yes, sir.

342
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:56,316
- Give it to Sam.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:22:00,765 --> 00:22:01,754
- Sam.
- Charlie!

344
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,404
- How do I look?
- Good.

345
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:07,877
Went to the gym, got a shower
and shave. Got my shoes shined too.

346
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:12,755
Know why? I'm going to the opera
tonight, which will be excruciating.

347
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,916
But I'm gonna do it anyway.

348
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:20,239
There's a birthday, and Leo wants you
to write a message from the president.

349
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:24,478
He wants me? He wants me
to write a birthday message?

350
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:26,681
Nancy Becker needs it tonight.

351
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:30,804
You sure he doesn't want
someone who isn't overqualified?

352
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:32,956
He specifically asked for you.

353
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:35,434
- What time is it?
- Ten after 7.

354
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,163
Somebody! Anybody!

355
00:22:37,325 --> 00:22:42,001
Write a two-page memo on the
history and accomplishments of...

356
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:46,397
...the assistant secretary of
transportation. It's under control.

357
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:55,556
Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

358
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:58,080
What was the last thing I said?

359
00:22:58,245 --> 00:23:01,954
- You said, "Are you listening to me?"
- Toby!

360
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,800
I'm not the one to talk to
about the bill. I feel hatred.

361
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:09,441
- Toward whom?
- Today it's Broderick and Eaton.

362
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:12,159
- Excuse me. What's going on?
- Hey.

363
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:17,035
Tell him that signing the bill,
thus swallowing the strip-mining pill...

364
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:21,437
...would not foreclose a PR approach
trumpeting bank reforms...

365
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:24,836
...while also excoriating
a strip-mining scam...

366
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:28,884
...which is what I'm happy to call it.
Tell him that.

367
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:34,802
Toby? Mandy wants you to recommend to
the president that we do it her way.

368
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:38,719
- Do you understand what she said?
- No, but she's confident.

369
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:43,675
- I would like to talk to Josh again.
- Talk to anyone, but I need to work.

370
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:46,041
Thank you.

371
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:47,394
Mandy?

372
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:50,159
You cut your noses off
to spite your faces.

373
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:52,361
- I wanted to ask you something.
- What?

374
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:54,163
- You know Danny Concanon?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:57,675
He's sniffing around
about the cabinet meeting.

376
00:23:57,845 --> 00:24:00,405
No big deal,
but I want him to back off.

377
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:02,362
- Make a trade.
- Yeah?

378
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,197
Give him a half-hour
with the president.

379
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:07,323
- Thanks.
- Will you help me with Josh and Toby?

380
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:12,639
The president's been messed with.
At the 11th hour, he got clipped.

381
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:16,923
Josh and Toby get geared up for this.
You can't talk them down.

382
00:24:17,085 --> 00:24:20,873
- You're idiots, you know that?
- We actually do know that.

383
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:25,158
- This is fine.
- Excellent!

384
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:29,477
They had you write this?
You're not a little overqualified?

385
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,602
I was happy to do it.

386
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,676
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

387
00:24:33,845 --> 00:24:37,633
Listen, as long as you're on it
and you don't mind...

388
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:42,680
...why don't we take advantage of it
and really do a job?

389
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:47,675
It's his 50th birthday. Give it the
Sam Seaborn quill. What do you think?

390
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,119
I'd be honored, sir.

391
00:24:49,285 --> 00:24:52,721
Take your time. Bring the next draft
when it's ready.

392
00:24:52,885 --> 00:24:56,434
- I appreciate it, Sam.
- My pleasure.

393
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,317
- Did you get a shoeshine, Sam?
- Yes, I did!

394
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:03,042
Hey, Sam!

395
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,565
- Hello.
- Are you ready to go?

396
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:09,797
I'd like to say, first,
you look beautiful.

397
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:11,557
- Thank you.
- I mean that.

398
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:16,640
- What would you like to say second?
- Can we talk in my office?

399
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,519
- Hello.
- Hello.

400
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:31,916
- May I discuss your story?
- Cabinet meeting, sure.

401
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:34,758
I don't believe
one of the cabinet officers--

402
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:37,957
They weren't the only ones
in the room.

403
00:25:40,845 --> 00:25:44,201
- I'm gonna fire her.
- Don't. It's not nice.

404
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:47,835
The president would like you
not to pursue this.

405
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:53,637
To show his gratitude, he'll give you
30 minutes on any subject you like.

406
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:57,837
That sounds good, but it's not enough.

407
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,041
- What else?
- I'd like you to sing.

408
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:01,678
- Danny.
- Little song.

409
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:03,722
- Will you take it?
- Yes.

410
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:05,318
Thank you.

411
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:07,157
- C.J.
- Yeah.

412
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,318
Anybody gets fired,
I'll write about why.

413
00:26:11,805 --> 00:26:13,636
Understood.

414
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,444
The assistant secretary
of transportation?

415
00:26:20,605 --> 00:26:22,596
- Can I ask you a few questions?
- Sure.

416
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:27,919
In the campaign, you wrote a good
portion of the stump speech, right?

417
00:26:28,085 --> 00:26:31,839
The acceptance speech,
the inaugural, State of the Union.

418
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:34,838
Now you're asked
to write a birthday card?

419
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:39,999
- Birthday message.
- For the secretary of transportation?

420
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,044
- It's the assistant secretary--
- The assistant secretary.

421
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,524
Yes. One of them.

422
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:49,041
If you didn't want to go,
you should have said so.

423
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:52,083
If you chickened out,
you should have called.

424
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:53,963
- I didn't.
- I'm dressed up.

425
00:26:54,125 --> 00:26:55,683
- My shoes are shined.
- Shut up.

426
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:57,278
This just came up.

427
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:01,279
It's his 50th birthday.
They couldn't have seen it coming?

428
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,878
- Fair point.
- I'm going home.

429
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:06,276
Don't go. Give me a half-hour
for the new draft.

430
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:07,514
A new draft?

431
00:27:07,725 --> 00:27:09,920
- Yes.
- You've already done a draft?

432
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:13,157
You need more than one draft
on a birthday card?

433
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:15,555
- Birthday message.
- Sam.

434
00:27:15,725 --> 00:27:18,000
Half-hour.
We'll get there by intermission.

435
00:27:18,165 --> 00:27:21,635
There'll be death and shrieking
in the second act.

436
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:24,235
Go.

437
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:27,599
- You look fantastic--
- Go!

438
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:38,238
We're gonna want a new draft
by the end of the week. Thank you.

439
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,679
- Toby?
- Yes?

440
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,996
- Know what I think?
- What?

441
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:54,159
It wasn't Broderick and Eaton.
I don't think they have the muscle.

442
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:57,044
- I think it was Crane.
- Yeah.

443
00:27:57,205 --> 00:28:01,278
Honest to God, I think it was Crane.
Your friend, Crane.

444
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:02,673
Yeah.

445
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,594
- The guy who said it would go through.
- Yeah.

446
00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:08,796
You're not bothered by this?

447
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:14,756
We've reached the end. I don't
care how, and I'm ready to move on.

448
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:15,954
How?

449
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,593
- Let's tell them to sign it.
- Not yet!

450
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:21,399
- It's over. We did fine.
- We got screwed!

451
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,163
Not so bad.

452
00:28:23,365 --> 00:28:25,833
But Crane and Broderick and Eaton?

453
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:28,843
- It was their turn.
- I'm still working on it.

454
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:32,441
- The president needs something.
- I got a few hours.

455
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,516
Suit yourself.

456
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:38,483
Good evening.
- Is he free?

457
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:41,079
- He's reading.
- I can come back.

458
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:43,281
Go in. He's looking for company.

459
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,962
- Hey, C.J.
- Good evening, am I disturbing you?

460
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:53,084
- No, no. Sit down.
- What's going on?

461
00:28:53,285 --> 00:28:57,039
- When will we have a solution?
- For the land use rider?

462
00:28:57,205 --> 00:29:00,083
I want the bill,
and I don't want to give in.

463
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:03,396
A classic conundrum.
Speaking of conundrums--

464
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,756
- I don't want to hear about Hoynes.
- Mr. President--

465
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:09,359
- Is Danny gonna make it a thing?
- No.

466
00:29:09,605 --> 00:29:14,395
- What did you give him?
- A half-hour sit-down on the record.

467
00:29:15,765 --> 00:29:16,800
Sold.

468
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:21,160
Sir? The vice president
wasn't the one who talked.

469
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:23,595
- Sure, he was.
- I don't think so.

470
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,241
I'm pretty sure it was
the woman taking minutes.

471
00:29:28,845 --> 00:29:31,439
- Mildred?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:34,165 --> 00:29:37,680
- Let's drop it.
- Yes, sir.

473
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:39,483
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

474
00:29:39,685 --> 00:29:43,234
- Okay, get out of here.
- Thank you.

475
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,082
Here we go.

476
00:29:54,285 --> 00:29:57,914
- Come on!
- I'm under enough pressure.

477
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:03,842
- It's a card!
- I was asked by the president.

478
00:30:05,245 --> 00:30:08,396
- What did you say?
- I was asked by the president.

479
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:11,682
Did you tell my father
we were going out?

480
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,234
Yes, I did.

481
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:18,041
Excuse me.

482
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,836
Okay, here we go.

483
00:30:25,245 --> 00:30:26,644
Nope!

484
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:31,515
Findings, which didn't support us,
due to committee speculation...

485
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:37,078
...need to be referred to the OMB.
Yours unhappily. Copy that to Josh.

486
00:30:37,325 --> 00:30:39,475
What will the president do
about Big Sky?

487
00:30:39,685 --> 00:30:43,963
When he tells me, I'll tell you.
What's next?

488
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:47,477
- Excuse me, Margaret. Hello.
- Hey, baby.

489
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:51,598
Don't "Hey, baby" me,
you addle-minded Machiavellian jerk!

490
00:30:51,805 --> 00:30:54,399
- Should I step out?
- Sounds like it.

491
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:57,403
- You gave him that idiot assignment!
- Yes.

492
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,681
- Why?
- Because I felt like it!

493
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:05,881
Your mom has a genuine beef. I widowed
her when I took over the campaign.

494
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,480
But I haven't done anything to you.

495
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:13,594
Working in the White House doesn't
allow flexibility for leisure...

496
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:17,360
...as you've discovered tonight.
I'm done being blamed.

497
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:21,200
- You make Sam write a birthday card.
- A birthday message.

498
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,403
- Why?
- Just my sense of humor.

499
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:26,482
- Hey, Mal.
- Good evening.

500
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:30,923
- Margaret! You're all dressed up.
- Yes, I am.

501
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:35,875
Yes, sir?
- Could you bring me today's schedule?

502
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,036
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

503
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:42,194
You look a little glum, Mallory.

504
00:31:42,405 --> 00:31:45,681
Did you have plans with someone
who had to cancel...

505
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:51,078
...because they made a commitment
to a common and higher purpose?

506
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,163
You're a coconspirator on this.

507
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:58,473
Thank you. These are some
things your father did today.

508
00:31:58,645 --> 00:32:00,283
He met with the CIA...

509
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,558
...and received a briefing about
stores of plutonium in a country...

510
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:07,723
...which is not on
our Christmas card list.

511
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:12,481
He brokered a compromise
for funding of something trivial...

512
00:32:12,645 --> 00:32:16,240
...but I can't remember what--
Oh, yes, the U.S. Army.

513
00:32:16,445 --> 00:32:19,437
He met with my chief counsel
as it's possible...

514
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:25,123
...I've broken several laws and may
serve time in prison after resigning.

515
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,719
- How'd that go?
- We're fine.

516
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:33,517
Cool. He received a security briefing
and wrote a position paper.

517
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:37,394
And he's been counseling me
on a decision I have to make.

518
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,557
By the way, this was a very light day.

519
00:32:40,765 --> 00:32:44,041
Due respect, Mr. President,
what's your point?

520
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,803
That's a perfectly fair question.

521
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:50,280
I can take it from here, sir.

522
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:53,437
Okay. I'm right next door.

523
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,402
My point is...

524
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:01,600
...give your dad a break.
He's your father.

525
00:33:01,805 --> 00:33:03,124
Thank you, sir.

526
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:07,238
- Are you blowing me off?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:33:07,405 --> 00:33:08,394
Okay.

528
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:13,483
- I'm not blaming you.
- It feels like you are.

529
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,762
- Let me fix that.
- Okay.

530
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:20,002
Let's you and I catch the second act.

531
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:23,322
Is there any other way
we can fix this?

532
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:26,682
Did you hear the president
tell you about my day?

533
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:30,440
- Yes.
- And now Chinese opera?

534
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:34,514
- Okay, coffee and dessert.
- Now you're talking!

535
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:38,434
- We should ask Sam.
- By all means, let's ask Sam.

536
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:39,879
Be nice to him.

537
00:33:40,045 --> 00:33:42,081
- I'll be gone for a while!
Okay.

538
00:33:42,285 --> 00:33:45,038
I'll be nice. I'll be nice.

539
00:33:54,605 --> 00:33:56,482
This is getting serious.

540
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,242
Good news.

541
00:33:59,685 --> 00:34:01,562
- Hello.
- Hello, Sam.

542
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:05,479
You're off the hook.
We'd like you to join us for coffee.

543
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:10,281
Also my father has something
he'd like to say to you. Dad?

544
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:13,881
- Is this really necessary?
- I believe it is.

545
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:19,153
I gave you the thing because
I was pissed. Blah, blah, blah.

546
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:23,964
- Well said, Dad.
- Anyway, I'm sorry about that.

547
00:34:24,525 --> 00:34:28,200
Yeah, I figured. Mind if I skip
coffee? I want to nail this.

548
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:31,238
- The first draft was fine.
- I want to nail it.

549
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:34,875
- Your first draft was fine.
- But still....

550
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,280
- You want to nail it?
- I do.

551
00:34:38,045 --> 00:34:40,764
You're so exactly like him.

552
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:48,156
That is the nicest thing
you've ever said to me. Thank you.

553
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:50,598
Let's go.

554
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:54,045
I'll be back in an hour.

555
00:34:55,445 --> 00:34:58,835
All right. Here we go.

556
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:12,524
Mr. President?
- Yes?

557
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:15,040
The vice president, sir.

558
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,036
Yeah, okay.

559
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:26,357
- Evening, sir.
- How are you, John?

560
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:29,995
- Fine, sir.
- Good. What can I do for you?

561
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:33,680
We should straighten out
this thing from this morning.

562
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:36,439
C.J.'s talked to Concanon.
We're fine.

563
00:35:37,325 --> 00:35:42,877
- Actually, I meant between us.
- That's a different story.

564
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:50,041
I was not Concanon's source. You can
believe that or not, but it is true.

565
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:52,043
Okay.

566
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:58,315
- Well, good night, Mr. President.
- Good night, John.

567
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:01,883
John?

568
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:04,844
What did I ever do to you?

569
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:08,879
What did I do to make you
treat me this way?

570
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:12,998
What did I ever do to you
except deliver the South?

571
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:19,280
You shouldn't have made me beg.
I was asking you to be vice president.

572
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:22,636
You had just kicked my ass
in a primary.

573
00:36:22,885 --> 00:36:26,241
I'm younger than you.
I have my career to think of.

574
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:29,716
Then don't stand there
and ask the question, John.

575
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:33,036
It weakened me right out of the gate.

576
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:37,282
You shouldn't have made me beg.

577
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:45,644
I'm glad C.J. straightened
things out with Danny.

578
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:52,040
- Good night, Mr. President.
- Good night, John.

579
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:58,876
This bill will stop the banking lobby
from getting bank deregulation.

580
00:36:59,045 --> 00:37:01,957
- Who am I talking to about this?
- Madison.

581
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,878
You don't think it's worth
giving up some land?

582
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:09,482
- There's a gain to beating the lobby.
- And a cost if it goes with a rider!

583
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:12,956
I know you want to win,
but you did, you won!

584
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:17,204
- No, we're tied.
- If that's the best, you call it a win.

585
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:23,196
It's not a win. Donna, tell Leo
I'll have a solution very soon.

586
00:37:23,365 --> 00:37:26,402
- Do you have a solution?
- Does it look like it?

587
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:28,237
- No.
- Then assume I don't.

588
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:30,361
I can put a best face on it.

589
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:34,598
You can put a best face on
a turnpike collision, I'm not moved.

590
00:37:38,285 --> 00:37:43,234
You're fighting the wrong fights
and for the wrong reasons.

591
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,844
That's all.

592
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:53,236
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

593
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,003
- You sure?
- Yeah.

594
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:59,522
Where's the Madison stuff?
It's 20 minutes, I need it faster.

595
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:03,155
We're working, but the
computer files are antiquated.

596
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:05,640
All right. Wait, what?

597
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,960
- I said they're--
- They're antiquated.

598
00:38:09,845 --> 00:38:10,834
Yeah.

599
00:38:11,405 --> 00:38:15,603
- They're antiquated.
- What's wrong with you?

600
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:21,079
Tell the president I'm ready
to see him at his convenience.

601
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:25,319
- You sure?
- Yeah.

602
00:38:30,405 --> 00:38:32,714
Hm.

603
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:34,995
- I tell you--
- Am I bothering you?

604
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:38,043
- I'm not relaxed!
- Maybe you need some wine.

605
00:38:38,205 --> 00:38:41,163
- Maybe you shouldn't stand there.
- Let me try.

606
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:44,044
- I'll nail it.
- Tell him to let me try.

607
00:38:44,205 --> 00:38:48,562
- The Antiquities Act.
- The Antiquities Act?

608
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,283
That's creative.

609
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:54,438
The president is empowered to make
any federal land a park.

610
00:38:54,605 --> 00:38:56,402
- Big Sky.
- Go tell him.

611
00:38:56,565 --> 00:38:58,123
- Wanna come?
- No.

612
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,434
What are you doing?

613
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,800
- I want to nail this.
- What is it?

614
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,433
- It's a birthday card.
- For who?

615
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:07,199
- I don't know.
- It's a birthday message.

616
00:39:07,365 --> 00:39:09,276
- Let me try.
- One more try!

617
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:13,643
The two of you need to put
your heads down on your desk.

618
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:17,036
You're starting off bad.

619
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:21,676
Both black and grizzly bears
inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie.

620
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:26,441
Hikers are told to talk or sing
to keep them at bay.

621
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:29,717
If I see a bear,
I'm supposed to sing to it, sir?

622
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:33,753
- It's not as silly as it sounds.
- It sounds pretty silly.

623
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,644
I suppose.

624
00:39:37,405 --> 00:39:39,202
- Anything else?
- Yes.

625
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:42,243
Glacier Park was the 10th.
We have 44 to go.

626
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:43,633
Forty-five.

627
00:39:43,805 --> 00:39:46,239
- I quit.
- I hear you.

628
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:50,637
- Have a good night.
- Good night, Mr. President.

629
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:55,518
- What you got?
- The Antiquities Act.

630
00:39:55,765 --> 00:40:00,156
You're going to establish
Big Sky National Park.

631
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:01,394
Yeah.

632
00:40:01,685 --> 00:40:03,676
- I can do this?
- Yeah.

633
00:40:03,845 --> 00:40:05,881
You know it's a bunch of rocks?

634
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:09,919
I'm sure someone with
your knowledge of the dork-like...

635
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:14,317
...can find a tree or a ferret
the public has a right to visit.

636
00:40:14,565 --> 00:40:19,195
More than a right, Josh.
It's a treat.

637
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:24,035
- You would enjoy nature.
- I've tried nature, sir.

638
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:31,045
The Antiquities Act.
This is simplicity itself.

639
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:32,433
- Yes, sir.
- Good job.

640
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:33,640
Thank you, sir.

641
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,842
Thank you. I'm going to bed.

642
00:40:37,045 --> 00:40:40,833
- Good night, Mr. President.
- Good night.

643
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,838
- Mr. President?
- Yeah?

644
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:55,159
We talk about enemies
more than we used to.

645
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,593
What?

646
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:03,238
We talk about enemies
more than we used to.

647
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,438
I wanted to mention that.

648
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,641
Yeah.

649
00:41:16,925 --> 00:41:20,440
- Good night, Mr. President.
- Good night.

650
00:42:13,725 --> 00:42:14,714
