1
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:07,358
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:11,273
You want to work for the leader
of the free world?

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,119
It took you long enough.

4
00:00:14,363 --> 00:00:16,957
I'll give you a head start on this.

5
00:00:17,163 --> 00:00:18,437
- Why?
- Being good.

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,838
This thing with your mom
and me will blow over.

7
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:22,112
It won't.

8
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:25,521
No bar will admit you
with a solicitation bust.

9
00:00:25,723 --> 00:00:27,395
I won't get busted.

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:36,634
The first lady will wear a Badgley
Mischka silk gown, beaded bodice.

11
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:39,562
- Shoes?
- She'll be wearing shoes.

12
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:44,115
Black suede Manolo Blahnik slides
with a mother-of-pearl buckle.

13
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:48,919
- Accessories?
- Gabriel Sanchez pearl necklace.

14
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:53,202
She'll carry a Cristina Bomba
silk pleated organdy evening bag.

15
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:54,597
Mrs. Siguto?

16
00:00:54,843 --> 00:00:57,516
She'll wear a silk
kebaya in dark purple...

17
00:00:57,763 --> 00:01:01,358
...and a black lace overlay.
Matching evening slippers.

18
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:05,193
Her jewelry is by an artist
from her birthplace, Jakarta.

19
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:09,237
It is fashioned in rubies and gold.
Anything else?

20
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:12,560
Nothing on the Nuclear
Test-Ban Treaty?

21
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:16,314
No. Okay. Thank you.

22
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:21,078
I love when <i>InStyle</i> magazine
gets press credentials.

23
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:24,116
<i>Mirabella</i> had to know
what wine will be served.

24
00:01:24,323 --> 00:01:26,757
- Good thing I had 22 years of school.
- Wine?

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,198
It's wine.
What do you need?

26
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:33,432
Sara's gained speed and power
and is now a class four system.

27
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:36,111
Mention preparations
and contingencies.

28
00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:38,439
- What is Sara?
- A hurricane.

29
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:42,392
- Where's it going?
- Georgia. It'll hit tonight.

30
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,673
- Is it serious?
- Ever been in one?

31
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,919
Me neither, but they look serious.

32
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,159
- They voted to strike.
- Teamsters?

33
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:52,759
- Leo's got them in a room.
- How long will it last?

34
00:01:53,003 --> 00:01:55,961
Midnight. Taft-Hartley expires.
Truckers walk.

35
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:59,354
- The state dinner's tonight.
- Make more food.

36
00:01:59,523 --> 00:02:01,559
Know about the storm?
Everyone but me.

37
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,761
Start preparing.
There's a situation in McClane.

38
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:06,356
- Virginia?
- Idaho.

39
00:02:07,363 --> 00:02:10,082
This place has been
surrounded four days.

40
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:13,235
A farmhouse with
18 to 40 survivalists.

41
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:15,434
- Armed? Are there kids?
- Yes.

42
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:19,875
FBI's deemed it a hostage situation,
so we got a new ball game.

43
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,439
Let me see if I have this.

44
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,840
A hurricane's heading for Georgia.

45
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:30,798
Management and labor are working out
a settlement to avoid a strike.

46
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:34,552
The government's planning a siege
on 18 to 40 citizens.

47
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:38,881
- During dinner for Indonesia's leader.
- You got it.

48
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,916
You know what
I'll get asked most often?

49
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,397
- Sondra?
- Sorry, C.J.

50
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:48,713
Black suede Manolo Blahnik slides
with a mother-of-pearl buckle.

51
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:51,312
- Thanks.
- No problem.

52
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:40,277
<i>Low-pressure system.</i>
<i>Another system.</i>

53
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:46,717
I'm talking to the Red Cross.
I'll call in an hour.

54
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:51,195
Donnatella Moss, a senior
Indonesian deputy is coming tonight.

55
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:55,716
Toby and I wanna talk to him alone.
Find out if he speaks English.

56
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:57,999
If not, we need an interpreter.

57
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:02,236
- What's his name?
- Rahmadi Sumahidjo Bambang.

58
00:04:02,403 --> 00:04:05,042
- Can you spell that?
- Not correctly.

59
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,036
- I've gotta tell you something.
- What?

60
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,882
I'm not wild about this
Indonesian thing.

61
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,802
- I've been reading.
- I wish you wouldn't.

62
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,837
You cull some bizarre fact
from a disreputable source...

63
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,477
- ...and exaggerate it.
- I do not!

64
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:23,598
In certain parts of Indonesia...

65
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,676
...they execute people
they suspect of being sorcerers.

66
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:29,601
- What?
- I read it.

67
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:33,000
They execute people
suspected of being sorcerers?

68
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:35,119
- They behead them.
- Sorcerers?

69
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:38,793
Gangs of people beheading
suspected sorcerers with--

70
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,682
- What does Death carry?
- A scythe.

71
00:04:41,843 --> 00:04:44,403
- With a scythe.
- Thanks for the heads-up.

72
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,992
That's who's coming to dinner.

73
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,802
- It got upgraded?
- It's a class 4.

74
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,079
FEMA's in Georgia
with the Red Cross.

75
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:54,956
President should prepare for
disaster relief.

76
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:58,877
- How about the truckers?
- I meet them in an hour.

77
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,074
C.J. needs to know
what they're wearing.

78
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,074
- The issue?
- Two-tiered hiring.

79
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,956
The company divides
itself into two bodies:

80
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:10,275
Full-time employees who enjoy
top market wages and benefits...

81
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:12,713
...and part-time or newer full-time...

82
00:05:12,883 --> 00:05:15,955
...who are paid lower wages
and get no benefits.

83
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,596
But they're part-time.

84
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:22,638
A lot of designated part-time workers
are de facto full-time employees...

85
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:25,556
...working similar hours
with a different title...

86
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:28,231
...at lower wages
with no benefits.

87
00:05:28,723 --> 00:05:31,442
- I'm with management.
- Imagine my surprise.

88
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:34,396
A young work force
looks for job flexibility...

89
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:36,878
...and won't commit to one company.

90
00:05:37,043 --> 00:05:39,477
- What do you expect?
- Fair hiring.

91
00:05:39,683 --> 00:05:44,040
McClane, Idaho-- I need someone
to keep the president and me updated.

92
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,438
- I can.
- Work with Toby on the toast.

93
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:48,076
- Don't need him.
- You do.

94
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:52,397
- Takes two to write it?
- The State Department's particular.

95
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,719
- I'll assign someone.
- I'll do it.

96
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,834
- You can't.
- Why not?

97
00:05:57,043 --> 00:06:01,833
You're a political consultant
and this is an actual thing.

98
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:07,522
I can play a role in issues. It won't
be the end to this administration.

99
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,759
Not this administration...

100
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,431
...but the end of this republic.

101
00:06:13,443 --> 00:06:17,675
Establish a contact at the
Justice Department and the FBI...

102
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:19,601
...and keep Josh informed.

103
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,311
What else?

104
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:23,559
The Redskins suck.

105
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:25,522
Thank you.

106
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:32,962
- Did Josh talk to you about--?
- Rahmadi Sumahidjo Bambang?

107
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,562
- Yes.
- I'm on it.

108
00:06:34,723 --> 00:06:39,353
You know that in parts of Indonesia
they execute suspected sorcerers?

109
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,002
Yes.

110
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:44,075
- You see?
- You're all crazy.

111
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,394
- Here, sir.
- Mr. President--

112
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,912
- No questions now.
- It's short.

113
00:06:49,123 --> 00:06:52,160
She's not worried about
the length of your question...

114
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:54,115
...but the length of my answer.

115
00:06:58,843 --> 00:07:02,313
- We're having salmon tonight.
- Yes.

116
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,435
- They told you that?
- Yes.

117
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:13,673
Yo-Yo Ma is going to play.

118
00:07:13,883 --> 00:07:17,080
Some Bach concertos, I believe.

119
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,758
- Do you like salmon?
- No.

120
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:25,352
Well, our mistake.

121
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,832
Yes.

122
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:37,832
What have you got?

123
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:41,160
We start by welcoming
our friends and guests.

124
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:46,483
Praise Siguto for leading his country
through change as Indonesia moves...

125
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:49,038
...from dictatorship to democracy.

126
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:52,838
The beginnings of democracy.
Don't get carried away.

127
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,433
"We've been friends
for 50 years--"

128
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,874
- Don't say "friends."
- It's a state dinner.

129
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,995
Don't remind people we were
friends of those...

130
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:05,552
...who oppressed people
while stealing their money.

131
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:09,392
- How else would you steal it?
- Write that in the toast.

132
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:13,319
You got something going on
tonight with Josh?

133
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,276
- Gotta see a guy about a thing.
- Need help?

134
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,800
No. Toughen this up.

135
00:08:21,003 --> 00:08:24,393
Thirty days with a mediator,
you couldn't fix this?

136
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,356
- There's fundamental differences.
- Name them.

137
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:29,076
The two-tiered hiring.

138
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:32,155
Our industry
competes with FedEx, UPS...

139
00:08:32,323 --> 00:08:35,440
...railroads, airlines,
freight operations.

140
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:40,115
To accept wage costs greater than
competitors' would cripple us.

141
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:43,554
- You're full of crap.
- This is the White House.

142
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,442
- Watch your mouth.
- Forgive me.

143
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:50,916
For all the danger your industry
faces from competition...

144
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:57,073
...trucks are still the main way of
moving things around, including food.

145
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:00,480
I'm talking about produce
rotting in warehouses.

146
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:07,361
I'm talking about fights in markets
over who gets the last bar of soap.

147
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,514
You have until midnight.

148
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:15,477
- You think I can't do this.
- Why aren't you in your office?

149
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:19,198
- I don't have an office here.
- There's a reason.

150
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:22,122
McClane police got a
search warrant for the house.

151
00:09:22,323 --> 00:09:24,678
They believed there was a gun...

152
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:28,637
...made illegal by a barrel
shorter than its design.

153
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:34,236
The people, who are exactly who you
think, refused entry to the police.

154
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,195
Did they do it politely?

155
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:39,600
They produced weapons,
if that's what you mean.

156
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:43,000
It bugs you that
the president listens to me.

157
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:46,434
I'm bugged when he listens
to anyone besides me.

158
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:50,391
You know why the FBI believed
there was an illegal weapon?

159
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:52,400
We sold it to them.

160
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,716
- You know that for sure?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,793
There are children in there...

162
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:01,836
...and the deputy attorney general...

163
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:06,713
...the FBI and the ATF
don't know who's in charge.

164
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:11,993
Aside from everything else, this is
a PR disaster waiting to happen...

165
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,763
...and it's gonna happen today.

166
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:19,832
- This is why you hired me.
- I was wondering why that was.

167
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:24,321
- It bugs you.
- Yes.

168
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,642
Yes.

169
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:40,035
President Siguto,
how are you enjoying America?

170
00:10:40,283 --> 00:10:44,834
- Fine, thank you.
- Would you mind expanding on that?

171
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,835
She'd like you to say
more on the subject.

172
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:52,075
I have nothing more
to say on the subject.

173
00:10:54,323 --> 00:10:55,517
One more question?

174
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:57,600
- Mr. President?
- Which one?

175
00:10:57,803 --> 00:11:01,955
President Bartlet. Did you see
the protestors this morning?

176
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:05,519
I try not to look out my window much.
Which ones?

177
00:11:05,723 --> 00:11:08,795
- Vermeil.
- Vermeil?

178
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:13,912
I'll cover vermeil at the briefing.
I gotta bring in the next group.

179
00:11:16,363 --> 00:11:17,512
Thank you.

180
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,994
- You don't know about it?
- It's about vermeil.

181
00:11:21,203 --> 00:11:24,195
- What's vermeil?
- I know what vermeil is.

182
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:27,634
My 1:00 briefing will be
about vermeil protestors.

183
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:30,676
I asked a question, he didn't answer.

184
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:33,118
There should be some follow-up.

185
00:11:33,323 --> 00:11:34,551
- Thanks.
- Carol?

186
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,196
She's gonna need you.

187
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:39,918
What's vermeil and
why are people protesting it?

188
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,318
- E-l-L?
- Maybe.

189
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:48,191
Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. President.

190
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,917
Would you excuse me?
Sir, if I could--?

191
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,200
Absolutely.
Pardon me one moment, please?

192
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:56,473
Excuse me, folks.

193
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:04,442
I can't decide if that
man's boring or rude.

194
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm trying to figure out how
he campaigned and won...

195
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:10,602
...then I remember,
we rig the election.

196
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,714
Must he sit with me tonight?

197
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:14,714
He's the guest of honor.

198
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,157
- And you?
- Your table.

199
00:12:16,323 --> 00:12:18,553
- Toby?
- With C.J. and Josh and Sam.

200
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,679
The fun table.
What do you need?

201
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:24,802
We're gonna clear a carrier
group from the Norfolk naval yard.

202
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:28,757
- The hurricane.
- It's standard. Get the ships out.

203
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:32,154
This is in case someone
asks why a carrier group...

204
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:35,156
...is in the North Atlantic.

205
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:41,037
Sorry to keep you waiting.

206
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:50,192
- Did I mention we're having salmon?
- Yes.

207
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,281
Read this.

208
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:10,479
"Indonesia's constitution
highlights democracy--"

209
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:13,316
- Read.
- I know what you're gearing up for.

210
00:13:13,523 --> 00:13:15,354
Read!

211
00:13:17,003 --> 00:13:21,360
"The ideology of Pancasila, which
your constitution is founded on...

212
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:25,112
...includes belief in a supreme being
and calls for tolerance."

213
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:28,275
You underlined that.
"Freedom of the press--"

214
00:13:28,803 --> 00:13:33,479
Is it good to invite people to dinner,
then tell them how they're wrong?

215
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:36,197
Absolutely.
Or it's just wasting food.

216
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,758
We're not saying how
to run their lives.

217
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:42,203
"It's time to meet
the promise enshrined...

218
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,958
...in the hearts of your people
as well as your laws"?

219
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:47,397
Friendly reminder.

220
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:50,035
- Can we soften this?
- No.

221
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,673
Something like,
"As has often been said:

222
00:13:54,003 --> 00:13:57,473
A friend tells a friend
the truth. Sometimes...

223
00:13:57,643 --> 00:14:00,203
...we speak candidly,
or we couldn't...

224
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:05,642
...hold the great honor of being known
the world over as Indonesia's friend."

225
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:08,433
Wow.

226
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:13,671
That was just about
the worst writing I've ever heard.

227
00:14:13,883 --> 00:14:15,111
I know.

228
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,635
Vermeil is silver, gilded in gold.

229
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:22,119
The White House has one
of the largest collections.

230
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:23,517
Why the protestors?

231
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:27,312
These are 18th and 19th-century
objects, many designed...

232
00:14:27,523 --> 00:14:31,198
...by the noted silversmith
Jean-Baptiste-Claude Odiot.

233
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:35,276
The collection's in the Gold Room
with the glass chandelier...

234
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:37,752
...made in England in 1785.

235
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:40,193
What does it have to do
with protestors?

236
00:14:40,403 --> 00:14:44,681
Nothing. It's interesting information
I thought I'd share with you.

237
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:48,319
Workers were blinded by
the mercury while making them.

238
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:52,232
Louis XV melted them
to pay for wars against his people.

239
00:14:52,403 --> 00:14:57,352
Some see them as symbolic of
government oppression of the people.

240
00:14:57,883 --> 00:15:01,273
We use them as
centerpieces with flowers.

241
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,680
Does the president worry
about sending a bad message?

242
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,875
I'll be honest.
I haven't run it by him yet.

243
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:12,559
I'll have that, and more scores
and highlights, at the next briefing.

244
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,355
Thank you.

245
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,921
I won't need a transcript of that.

246
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,717
You're a rabble-rouser.
You rouse rabbles.

247
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:28,441
I saw your vermeil demonstration.
Six people in Lafayette Park.

248
00:15:28,643 --> 00:15:31,077
I didn't say it was Selma, Alabama.

249
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:36,437
Six people protesting on a Friday
and you just lent them a megaphone.

250
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,520
- What do you call it?
- A good job.

251
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:42,392
- You're proud of yourself.
- What are you wearing tonight?

252
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:44,719
Your paper wants to know?

253
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,477
- I do.
- You wanna know what I'm wearing?

254
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:49,361
Yeah.

255
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:57,792
I'm wearing an evening
gown of gray silk.

256
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,642
Good. I'll be looking forward to it.

257
00:16:00,843 --> 00:16:03,801
I've got to go deal
with the vermeil crazies.

258
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,158
- See you.
- Okay.

259
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:13,638
I thought since this toast
is at the end of the talks...

260
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:16,158
...that we should lighten it up.

261
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,518
- I've got con law.
- Sit quietly?

262
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:20,514
- I need to study.
- Okay.

263
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:24,474
- Thanks.
- I'll have my sandwich.

264
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,082
Should I have the ham
or chicken salad?

265
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,074
The chicken salad's mine.

266
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:33,553
In this environment,
it's community food, right?

267
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:37,233
- Are you afraid of being seen with me?
- Because of your clothes?

268
00:16:37,443 --> 00:16:39,911
- What's wrong with this?
- Nothing.

269
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:44,594
Because of my night job. You're not
afraid of being seen with me?

270
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:48,961
- No.
- Okay.

271
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,559
- Your night job's crummy.
- Yes.

272
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:55,598
- You got a thing tonight? Date?
- A client? Yeah.

273
00:16:55,763 --> 00:17:00,917
- Who? I was just--
- I thought we had a deal.

274
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:03,432
- Where you going?
- I don't know.

275
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:06,476
I don't know.
He calls and says what to wear.

276
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:09,555
- It's a surprise.
- Is this someone who's--?

277
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:12,157
I have class and haven't finished--

278
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:15,161
It's Gideon v. Wainwright,
372 U.S. 335.

279
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:18,599
Cite the precedent,
cite Black's opinion for the majority.

280
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,118
Thank you for the geek bravado...

281
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:24,673
...but I'd like to learn this
so I can graduate...

282
00:17:24,883 --> 00:17:26,555
...practice law
and end my night job.

283
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,199
Learn from my experience.

284
00:17:29,363 --> 00:17:32,241
School bears little relationship
to practice.

285
00:17:32,763 --> 00:17:35,596
It bears a relationship to graduating,
right? Shut up.

286
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:39,512
Your night job stinks,
and I'm taking your sandwich.

287
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:46,998
We're all agreed that
militias pose an inherent threat.

288
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:51,116
They're well-armed cadres of lunatics
who undermine government.

289
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:54,002
Would it be inappropriate
for me to speak?

290
00:17:54,163 --> 00:17:55,198
No, of course not.

291
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,912
Kooks, nuts, extremists,
the lunatic fringe element:

292
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:02,160
This is the inevitable
byproduct of a democracy...

293
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:06,078
...such as pornography is a
byproduct of free speech.

294
00:18:06,243 --> 00:18:11,363
They aren't thumbing through <i>Hustler.</i>
They're armed and holding hostages.

295
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:15,715
We think they're holding hostages.
We sold them the gun to begin with.

296
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:20,280
- It's called a sting.
- Another word for it is entrapment.

297
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:23,953
- A judge won't--
- I'm not talking about the courts.

298
00:18:24,123 --> 00:18:27,195
- I'm talking public opinion.
- This is two different conversations.

299
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,917
- You want to raid?
- Not with guns blazing.

300
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,438
We'll fire tear gas
through windows.

301
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:35,680
The front page will be
a woman with a baby...

302
00:18:35,843 --> 00:18:39,916
...and FBI jackets in the foreground.
We could starve them out.

303
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:45,521
They've a five-year supply of rations,
to say nothing of ammunition.

304
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:51,392
There's no way this'll end good.
So end it fast.

305
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:54,359
- I agree.
- What about a negotiator?

306
00:18:54,563 --> 00:18:56,952
- Negotiate what?
- A peaceful settlement.

307
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:01,002
This is a standoff.
A settlement is "Put your guns down."

308
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,678
It would be wise if we tried
every peaceful solution...

309
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,357
...before we got all Rambo-ed up.

310
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:12,552
Mandy, thank you. Josh, will
you two give us a minute, please?

311
00:19:19,563 --> 00:19:24,762
It's not macho for the White House to
be aggressive in preserving democracy.

312
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:28,233
It's not the nuts that are
the threat to democracy.

313
00:19:28,403 --> 00:19:32,362
As history has shown us,
the greatest threat to democracy...

314
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:35,031
...is the state's power
over its citizens...

315
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:38,878
...which is always unleashed in the
name of preservation.

316
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,353
This isn't abstract.
This isn't theoretical.

317
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:45,117
The FBI says "Come out,"
you do it.

318
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:48,434
Then you avail yourself
of the justice system.

319
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:52,562
You believe that, or are you
pissed because I got in the game?

320
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:56,432
The president's with you.
Chafey's sending a negotiator.

321
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,673
Good.

322
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:03,963
You're in the game now.

323
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:13,834
<i>If you can't say why you're there,</i>
<i>you're a sorcerer.</i>

324
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:17,513
If you try to run, you're a sorcerer.

325
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:22,035
The prudent thing is to stand
still and explain your business.

326
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:25,997
Once the scythe comes out,
I'm probably gonna haul ass.

327
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,477
- Excuse me.
- What?

328
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:29,913
- I need a favor.
- What is it?

329
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,075
- My grandparents live near Georgia.
- Are they evacuating?

330
00:20:33,443 --> 00:20:36,355
- I don't know.
- Phones are down in Georgia.

331
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:41,481
- I'm sorry to ask you this, but--
- Donna, call FEMA. Use my name.

332
00:20:41,643 --> 00:20:43,998
When that doesn't work,
use Leo's name.

333
00:20:44,163 --> 00:20:47,280
- They don't get around well.
- We'll find them.

334
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,680
Hi.

335
00:20:52,883 --> 00:20:54,953
I look good, don't you think?

336
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:57,591
You do too,
but I look even better.

337
00:20:57,803 --> 00:21:00,192
The FBI guy's been
in there a few hours.

338
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:03,042
- Think that's good?
- I really don't know.

339
00:21:03,243 --> 00:21:05,120
I'm asking you what you think.

340
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,598
I don't have any thoughts on it.

341
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,958
- And the Teamsters?
- I don't know.

342
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:12,876
- Any news on the hurricane?
- I don't know.

343
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:18,037
- What is it you do here exactly?
- It's never been made clear to me.

344
00:21:20,883 --> 00:21:22,714
He's not here.

345
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,795
- We look good!
- Don't we?

346
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:30,193
Do you guys want to be alone?

347
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:32,553
I'm finishing up this speech.

348
00:21:32,723 --> 00:21:34,156
Can you think of some connection...

349
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:37,759
...between Siguto
and the U.S., from his past?

350
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:41,882
He was almost pushed from an
airplane by a CIA operative.

351
00:21:42,043 --> 00:21:44,034
- I'll leave that out.
- I would.

352
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,115
Excuse me, Josh.
Can I speak with you?

353
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,433
- Is he in? Let's go.
- There's a problem.

354
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:54,717
This is Mr. Minaldi, the interpreter
for the State Department.

355
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:58,639
- Do you speak Indonesian?
- There's no such language.

356
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,596
Indonesians speak 583
different languages.

357
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:06,194
I speak Javanese.
Mr. Bambang speaks Batak.

358
00:22:06,363 --> 00:22:09,673
- It's under control.
- It's 7:30. Anyone at State?

359
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:13,199
- No. Mr. Minaldi speaks Portuguese.
- And?

360
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:16,440
A guy in the kitchen
can translate Mr. Bombang's--

361
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:20,642
Bambang's Batak into Portuguese,
then Mr. Minaldi will translate.

362
00:22:20,803 --> 00:22:25,354
Why can't the kitchen guy
translate Batak into English?

363
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:28,031
- He can't speak English.
- You're kidding.

364
00:22:28,243 --> 00:22:30,677
He speaks Batak and Portuguese,
though.

365
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:32,481
- Is the bar open?
- Yeah.

366
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:35,396
Make this work.

367
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:37,719
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:43,923 --> 00:22:45,561
Have you seen the first--?

369
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:51,797
- Good evening.
- Nice threads, girl.

370
00:22:51,963 --> 00:22:55,353
Showing a little decolletage
wouldn't have killed you.

371
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:58,913
Harry and Nancy O'Malley,
Douglas and Barbara Colson...

372
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:02,280
- ...and Steven Colson, a cardiologist.
- Pleasure.

373
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:03,911
Pleasure to meet you.

374
00:23:04,243 --> 00:23:06,757
This is C.J., the press secretary.

375
00:23:06,923 --> 00:23:09,517
She's not married, Steven,
and no boyfriend.

376
00:23:09,683 --> 00:23:13,278
- Thank you, Mrs. Bartlet.
- Would you excuse us?

377
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,358
He's heir to Colson Technologies.

378
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:21,037
- I appreciate the thought.
- What's up?

379
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:23,842
I spoke to Peggy about the vermeil.

380
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:27,798
I'm not embarrassed by it.
We didn't spend new money.

381
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:31,280
- But it's history.
- Better or worse, it's our history.

382
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,197
We won't lock it in the basement
or brush it with paint.

383
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,443
Okay. Good answer.

384
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:42,398
- The truth does it almost every time.
- Yes, ma'am.

385
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:46,556
- Cardiologist.
- Yes, ma'am.

386
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:51,634
I'm sorry, is that Leo McGarry
or is that Fred Astaire?

387
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:54,920
- Fred Astaire.
- Where's my husband?

388
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,960
On a call.
He'll meet you there.

389
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:59,353
- Teamsters?
- It's been 10 hours.

390
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:01,912
- What do you think?
- We'll be okay.

391
00:24:02,123 --> 00:24:03,351
Mingle.

392
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:17,592
- Anything?
- This is the Red Cross.

393
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:20,641
- What about Idaho?
- Nobody's calling back.

394
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:23,158
What is going on?

395
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,755
Schmooze someone for me.

396
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:32,713
He's Carl Everett, and he's raised
a ton of money for us in the Midwest.

397
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:34,874
Carl, I'd like you to meet--

398
00:24:35,043 --> 00:24:40,561
Toby Ziegler, Sam Seaborn,
and Joshua Lyman.

399
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:45,194
- Our reputations precede us.
- They ought to. You do fine work.

400
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:48,873
- Excuse me.
- How long you in town, Mr. Everett?

401
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:53,634
Just for the night.
Let me introduce my date. Brittany?

402
00:24:59,003 --> 00:25:01,198
This is Brittany.
This is--

403
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:04,321
- Toby Ziegler.
- Josh Lyman.

404
00:25:07,323 --> 00:25:09,279
- Sam Seaborn.
- Nice to meet you.

405
00:25:09,443 --> 00:25:11,161
We're gonna head over.

406
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:15,242
- Maybe I'll talk with you all later.
- Great.

407
00:25:15,763 --> 00:25:17,833
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

408
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:26,438
Charlie! Your grandparents
are in a shelter in Granville.

409
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:29,675
Thank God.
How long do they have to stay?

410
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:32,311
People are being sent
back right now.

411
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:36,635
The hurricane shifted direction.
It's moving to the Atlantic.

412
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:40,072
- What's happening?
- A new situation.

413
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:42,399
It's moving east.
What kind of situation?

414
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:45,481
There's a fleet of ships out there.

415
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:48,313
- Oh, God.
- Do you know about this?

416
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:51,600
They evacuated a carrier
group this morning...

417
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,879
...as a safety precaution.

418
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,477
They're in the path of the hurricane.

419
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:59,396
- Can they get out?
- It's 600 miles wide.

420
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:02,077
They're locked in.
How bad can this get?

421
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:07,199
- Catastrophic.
- What do you want to do?

422
00:26:08,603 --> 00:26:12,357
- Let's do this and then get ready.
- I should start now.

423
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:17,593
I don't want to tip the press.
Let's go to a party.

424
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,722
Appreciate your call.
Thank you.

425
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:44,035
I'm not hearing anything from
the FBI or from Justice.

426
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:46,797
I can't get information out of Idaho.

427
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:49,477
- It's over.
- What do you mean?

428
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:54,074
That was Chafey. They took the house,
34 occupants, all in custody.

429
00:26:54,243 --> 00:26:55,392
What happened?

430
00:26:55,563 --> 00:27:00,318
They shot the FBI negotiator.
He's in critical condition.

431
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:03,555
Ladies and gentlemen,
President and Mrs. Bartlet...

432
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:07,278
...accompanied by
President and Mrs. Rahm Siguto.

433
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:11,271
I should call-- Get on the phone.

434
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:14,395
I'm gonna throw up.

435
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:29,482
- Without warning?
- Yeah.

436
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:32,157
It shifted direction with no warning?

437
00:27:32,323 --> 00:27:36,714
- It's not an anomaly, but it's unusual.
- I would think.

438
00:27:40,363 --> 00:27:44,436
How big is this carrier group?
How many men, how many ships?

439
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:47,521
It has the carrier
<i>John F. Kennedy...</i>

440
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:51,193
...which carries 5000 men,
two guided missile cruisers...

441
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:55,555
...two destroyers and two
battleships. Over 12,000 men.

442
00:27:55,723 --> 00:28:00,922
- How soon before the worst starts?
- About 20 minutes.

443
00:28:01,083 --> 00:28:03,677
Can I speak with the fleet commander?

444
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,953
We can set a hookup right here.

445
00:28:06,163 --> 00:28:08,233
- Do it.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

446
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:10,473
Thank you.

447
00:28:16,323 --> 00:28:21,443
- Any word on the FBI guy's condition?
- They're prepping him for surgery.

448
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,960
What do I do now?

449
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:29,116
Go back to the party.

450
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:44,436
Mr. Gomez.

451
00:28:46,803 --> 00:28:49,442
You speak Batak, is that correct?

452
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:56,874
And, as you just did,
you also speak Portuguese.

453
00:29:01,763 --> 00:29:03,833
But not English.

454
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,080
Those are tough languages.

455
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:13,761
You may want to try English one
day, seeing how you live here.

456
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:16,956
Don't translate that.

457
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:22,398
Mr. Bambang, thank you for agreeing
to meet with me today.

458
00:29:34,763 --> 00:29:36,196
"You're welcome."

459
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,435
Sorry I'm late.

460
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,159
I'm Josh Lyman.

461
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:48,478
This is gonna take a while.

462
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:51,441
- "Pleased to meet you."
- Enjoying the evening?

463
00:29:51,603 --> 00:29:54,879
This isn't the best
kind of thing for chitchat.

464
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,193
- Mandy's upset.
- You talk to her?

465
00:29:57,363 --> 00:30:01,595
- I didn't do a great job.
- "I didn't like the salmon."

466
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:05,591
He's answering a question
from half an hour ago.

467
00:30:05,803 --> 00:30:10,001
- Mr. Bambang--
- Why don't we just speak in English?

468
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:19,961
I was told-- You should keep
in mind all the things I do right.

469
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:23,671
- Should I go?
- Yes.

470
00:30:24,163 --> 00:30:28,122
Mr. Gomez, Mr. Minaldi,
thank you for your trouble.

471
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,200
What can I do for you, gentlemen?

472
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:42,800
A friend of mine's in one of your
jails. I want you to let him out.

473
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:47,678
- But your friend isn't an American.
- He's French.

474
00:30:47,843 --> 00:30:50,721
Why not let the French
take care of it?

475
00:30:50,883 --> 00:30:53,636
He's my friend and
the French don't care.

476
00:30:53,843 --> 00:30:57,631
- The extradition process is--
- We don't mean that.

477
00:30:57,803 --> 00:31:02,479
You unlock the cell, put him in a car,
and drive him to the border.

478
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:04,355
He led demonstrations.

479
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:09,359
- He teaches students how to protest.
- So you're asking as a favor.

480
00:31:10,323 --> 00:31:12,393
Senior aide to senior aide.

481
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:16,320
- Yes.
- I think you have a lot of nerve.

482
00:31:16,523 --> 00:31:19,595
That was a humiliating toast
your president made...

483
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:23,352
...and I know you were
the one who wrote it.

484
00:31:28,043 --> 00:31:32,514
Understand that with so many
people watching, so much coverage...

485
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,112
...we had to be clear that the U.S...

486
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:38,400
...with its commitment
to human rights, is obligated--

487
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:41,197
Don't you find it
hypocritical that a people...

488
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:45,276
...who wiped out a century's
worth of Native Americans...

489
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:49,999
...should lecture the world
so earnestly on human rights?

490
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:52,637
Yes, I do.

491
00:31:52,843 --> 00:31:57,758
You humiliated my president tonight,
for no other reason than to show off.

492
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:01,512
Now you want me to do you a favor?

493
00:32:02,443 --> 00:32:04,479
Go to hell.

494
00:32:11,523 --> 00:32:14,162
- We'll talk to the French.
- Yeah.

495
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:19,711
We'll talk to the French.

496
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:37,479
That's a nice dress.

497
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:40,311
You're not supposed to be here.

498
00:32:40,603 --> 00:32:44,482
KDHN reports an FBI agent went
down in a raid in McClane.

499
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:47,392
- Statement in 15 minutes.
- What happened?

500
00:32:47,563 --> 00:32:50,600
Did you hear me say 15 minutes?

501
00:32:50,763 --> 00:32:52,196
What did I do?

502
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,554
Do you flirt with me to get stories?

503
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,317
I'm doing it to flirt with you.

504
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:02,159
- I don't believe you.
- That's your problem.

505
00:33:02,323 --> 00:33:04,120
What's Sara gonna hit?

506
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:08,799
You say I'm too friendly with press,
and I'm a weak press secretary.

507
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:10,801
I never said you're weak.

508
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:14,552
- You thought it.
- You did well with the vermeil.

509
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:16,156
- You're doing it.
- I know.

510
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:19,599
- I have work to do.
- No problem.

511
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:23,397
You really like the dress?

512
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,835
Yes.

513
00:33:28,363 --> 00:33:29,876
All right, whatever.

514
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:35,598
- I hope the FBI guy pulls through.
- Fifteen minutes.

515
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,359
<i>To accept these policies...</i>

516
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:44,361
...would weaken our
ability to represent...

517
00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:48,192
...or retain younger workers,
and we won't let it happen.

518
00:33:48,363 --> 00:33:51,002
- I disagree.
- No kidding.

519
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,715
- How we doing?
- We're at an impasse.

520
00:33:55,923 --> 00:34:01,236
Hungry? Tired? Talk to me five minutes
apiece and we'll settle this.

521
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:03,752
Stay standing.

522
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:20,597
- Have you got just a minute?
- Sure.

523
00:34:21,443 --> 00:34:23,877
- Can I cut to the last page?
- Sure.

524
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,081
You're someone
I could have a relationship with.

525
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:30,196
- A relationship with me?
- What do you say?

526
00:34:30,363 --> 00:34:33,036
I cost $500 an hour.

527
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,715
In the private sector,
I cost $500 an hour.

528
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:39,483
- I don't understand.
- Want some food?

529
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,634
There's Todd. Excuse me.

530
00:34:44,643 --> 00:34:46,156
- I didn't know.
- What?

531
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:51,272
- I didn't know where he was taking me.
- He just tells you what to wear.

532
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:55,396
- That's great.
- This isn't exactly your business.

533
00:34:56,243 --> 00:35:00,282
I'm not here for you.
I'd be here whether you were or not.

534
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:03,719
You're just some guy
who happens to know me.

535
00:35:03,923 --> 00:35:05,834
- Thanks.
- You know what I mean.

536
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:10,952
Talk about being here and not being
here till blood pours out my ears.

537
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:14,202
- Good evening.
- Are you enjoying yourself?

538
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:15,717
Yes.

539
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:21,760
Won't you introduce me?

540
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:26,359
- Okay.
- Mrs. Bartlet, I'm Brittany Rollins.

541
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:28,320
- Abigail Bartlet.
- It's an honor.

542
00:35:28,523 --> 00:35:32,755
You're sweet. Sorry to interrupt.
I'm looking for the president.

543
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:36,154
He's in the West Wing.
I'm not sure why, but I can--

544
00:35:36,323 --> 00:35:40,111
- To pistol-whip the trucking industry.
- Why would he--?

545
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:44,720
Because he can't save a gunshot victim
or stop a hurricane.

546
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:47,602
- You are thoroughly charming.
- Thank you.

547
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:51,233
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.

548
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:54,276
That was incredible.

549
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:58,799
I'm just gonna eat, if that's okay.

550
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:08,678
I'll give you $10,000
not to go home with him tonight.

551
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:26,361
An inflationary surge would wreak
havoc on economic policies...

552
00:36:26,563 --> 00:36:29,555
- ...that allow the U.S. to enjoy--
- Time's up.

553
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:32,112
I didn't get my full five minutes.

554
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,996
I got tired of listening.
Now you listen.

555
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:39,315
I have a Nobel Prize in economics.
None of you have a clue.

556
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:44,917
At 12:01 a.m., I'm using my executive
power to nationalize trucking.

557
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:48,401
- You can't.
- Fourteen of my lawyers disagree.

558
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:51,163
- Truman did it.
- The Supreme Court struck it down.

559
00:36:51,323 --> 00:36:53,632
New bench. I'll take my chances.

560
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:57,079
As for labor, I'm calling Congress
into session...

561
00:36:57,283 --> 00:36:59,877
...to give me power to draft truckers.

562
00:37:00,403 --> 00:37:04,078
You're gonna love our food.
Nice talking to you folks.

563
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:09,317
If this isn't settled in 47 minutes,
we know where to find you.

564
00:37:18,963 --> 00:37:22,000
I shouldn't have stayed away so long.

565
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:29,319
- I'm all right.
- I shouldn't have extended the trip.

566
00:37:29,483 --> 00:37:32,281
I approved a plan
for an FBI negotiator.

567
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:36,761
- I know.
- He's in surgery now.

568
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:41,193
One of the things that happens
when I stay away...

569
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:46,158
...is that you forget you don't have
the power to fix everything.

570
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:49,401
You have a big brain
and a good heart...

571
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:51,958
...and an ego the size of Montana.

572
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:55,238
You do, Jed.

573
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,913
You don't have the power
to fix everything.

574
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:06,240
But I do like watching you try.

575
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:16,118
What the hell--?

576
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:22,319
If this isn't a metaphor for
powerlessness, I don't know what is.

577
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:25,674
We better get back to work.

578
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:34,193
- Sir?
- We got the commander?

579
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:36,280
Radios are down on the <i>JFK...</i>

580
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:39,003
...along with the
<i>Normandy</i> and <i>South Carolina.</i>

581
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:40,676
We've got the <i>Hickory...</i>

582
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:44,836
...a maintenance and supply boat
that sails with the fleet.

583
00:38:48,963 --> 00:38:51,682
So I'll talk to the
captain of the <i>Hickory</i>?

584
00:38:51,883 --> 00:38:56,001
The intercom's out.
They're looking for him on foot, sir.

585
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:58,882
- Is someone there?
- Kid in the radio shack.

586
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:02,080
- You're kidding.
- No, sir.

587
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:05,518
Talk to the boy.

588
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:17,718
- Hello, anyone there?
<i>- This is the USS</i> Hickory.

589
00:39:17,883 --> 00:39:20,522
This is the White House.
Who is this?

590
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:24,437
<i>This is signalman third class</i>
<i>Harold Lewis.</i>

591
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:30,760
Son, this is President Bartlet.

592
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:34,632
Hello?

593
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:38,512
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Is your C.O. around?

594
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:42,392
<i>Sir, they're getting him</i>
<i>right now, sir.</i>

595
00:39:42,563 --> 00:39:45,760
Can I talk to you in the meantime?

596
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:53,755
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Are you all right, Harold?

597
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:57,831
<i>I hit my head on-- I hit my head.</i>

598
00:39:58,003 --> 00:40:00,358
- Are you bleeding?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

599
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:04,641
- Can you put something on it?
<i>- I need to get to the other....</i>

600
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:07,397
<i>I can't reach it.</i>

601
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:10,714
You go over and get it.
I'll stay right here.

602
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:26,832
Harold, are you back?

603
00:40:27,003 --> 00:40:30,359
<i>Yes, sir. The skipper</i>
<i>should be here any minute.</i>

604
00:40:30,523 --> 00:40:34,118
- Can you tell us what's going on?
<i>- Well....</i>

605
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:41,993
We're here.
Can you tell us what's going on?

606
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:48,477
<i>We're looking at 80-foot seas</i>
<i>with winds up to 120 knots...</i>

607
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:53,114
<i>... we have solid green water</i>
<i>over the bow...</i>

608
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:56,593
<i>...and we've got a fire</i>
<i>in the engine room.</i>

609
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,678
<i>We lost our running lights</i>
<i>and may get run over...</i>

610
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:04,961
<i>...by an aircraft carrier</i>
<i>that can't see in the dark.</i>

611
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:18,192

Sounds pretty bad.

612
00:41:18,363 --> 00:41:21,719
I think I'd ask for my money back.

613
00:41:24,363 --> 00:41:26,513
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

614
00:41:26,683 --> 00:41:30,358
I'm gonna stay right here
while the radio works, okay?

615
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:32,753
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

616
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:36,156
<i>Hang on.</i>
