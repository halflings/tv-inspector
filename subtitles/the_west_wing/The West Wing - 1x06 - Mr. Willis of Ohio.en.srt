1
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:08,909
<i>Previously on</i> The West Wing:

2
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:10,785
Eagle's by.

3
00:00:10,993 --> 00:00:13,143
It's the most important thing.

4
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:17,710
- Not more important than your marriage.
- Yes, it is.

5
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:22,469
I'm a nice guy having a bad day.
I accidentally slept with a prostitute.

6
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:26,222
- Which kid is my boss's daughter?
- That would be me.

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,789
My youngest daughter, Zoey,
is down from Hanover.

8
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,711
Don't call her ma'am.

9
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:35,383
- I should call you Zoey?
- If I can call you Charlie.

10
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,706
Nine, no help. Jack, no help.

11
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:46,507
Eight, possible flush.
King, possible flush.

12
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,386
Ace, no help.
Six, possible straight.

13
00:00:49,953 --> 00:00:52,262
Love for the dealer.
Ace bets.

14
00:00:52,473 --> 00:00:53,622
- Check.
- Check.

15
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,869
- Check.
- Check.

16
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:57,347
Check.

17
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:00,952
Check.

18
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,427
- Mr. President?
- There is one fruit--

19
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,703
- Oh, please.
- There is one fruit--

20
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:12,347
Mr. President, check or bet, sir.

21
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:16,466
- There is one fruit--
- Or give us a quiz on inane trivia.

22
00:01:16,713 --> 00:01:20,865
There is one fruit whose seeds
are on the outside. Name it.

23
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:23,024
- Is it the kumquat?
- No.

24
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,705
Check or bet, sir?

25
00:01:25,913 --> 00:01:27,471
I bet five.

26
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:30,506
- Call.
- See it.

27
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:31,941
Fold.

28
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:34,462
- See it.
- Call it.

29
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:38,746
I see it, and I raise you five.

30
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:40,866
Trouble.

31
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:44,671
Mr. President?

32
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:47,229
It's the strawberry.

33
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,906
I raised your bet.

34
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:55,745
Yes, you did. And it was a bold move,
as Leo has the six you're looking for.

35
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:58,023
- You call the raise?
- It depends.

36
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,427
On what?

37
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:05,265
There are 14 punctuation marks in
standard English grammar. Name them.

38
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:07,111
- Period.
- Comma.

39
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:08,587
- Colon.
- Semicolon.

40
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,387
- Dash.
- Hyphen.

41
00:02:11,593 --> 00:02:12,946
Apostrophe.

42
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:15,345
There are seven more.

43
00:02:15,713 --> 00:02:19,592
Question mark,
exclamation point, quotation marks...

44
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:23,308
...brackets, parentheses,
braces and ellipses.

45
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:24,992
Do you call the raise?

46
00:02:25,193 --> 00:02:31,063
There are only three words in English
that begin with the letters D-W.

47
00:02:31,273 --> 00:02:33,992
This is why we get nothing done.

48
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,070
Can anyone name them for me?

49
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:38,946
Three words that begin with D-W?

50
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:41,269
- Dwindle.
- Dwarf.

51
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,584
Dwindle and dwarf....

52
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,742
Come on, Princeton, we got two.

53
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:50,547
I see your five
and raise you five.

54
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,186
Dwarf, dwindle....

55
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:53,952
Fold.

56
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:56,269
Last card down.

57
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:01,272
"A witch's brew, a magic spell,
an enchanted forest where--"

58
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:04,073
Dwell! Dwindle, dwarf and dwell.

59
00:03:04,313 --> 00:03:07,703
The answer's correct,
but let's check with our judges--

60
00:03:07,913 --> 00:03:09,904
I'm sorry, time expired.

61
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,626
- What time?
- My time.

62
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,983
You have your own time?

63
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,032
I call.

64
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,544
Trip nines.

65
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:24,030
Take your money, sir.

66
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:28,306
You'd "dwell" to report that
to the IRS, because I will.

67
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:31,708
I'm done. I'm heading home.

68
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,864
- Kiss Jenny for me.
- I will.

69
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:37,907
Sam, I'm going to the office for
the commerce report. You?

70
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:40,747
- I was gonna go home.
- Sam...

71
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:44,707
...I'm going to the office
for the commerce report. You?

72
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:49,111
I'm going to make sure
you understand the commerce report.

73
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:54,023
When I'm through you'll know all about
standard data vs. sampling data.

74
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,906
Charlie, I'm going to the residence.

75
00:03:57,113 --> 00:04:00,344
- I've got some paperwork.
- Don't stay too late.

76
00:04:00,553 --> 00:04:02,908
- How'd you do?
- 84 bucks.

77
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:06,270
- Most of that's mine.
- What's that?

78
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:12,663
Mr. President, I'm sorry,
the building's not secure.

79
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:15,268
Would everyone stay in the room?

80
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:20,304
- This happens way too often.
- It's pledge week at the fraternities.

81
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:23,425
- Clear the windows.
- The whole room is windows.

82
00:04:23,633 --> 00:04:25,510
- Josh.
- I'm cooperating.

83
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,511
This will be under control soon, sir.

84
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,462
What body of water in South America
is formed by--?

85
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:47,023
Excuse me, Wink Martindale.
Is this really the time?

86
00:04:47,233 --> 00:04:50,623
Not up on your South American
maritime geography?

87
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,949
- Clear.
- Saved by the bell.

88
00:04:53,153 --> 00:04:56,782
This didn't used to happen
at my old job.

89
00:05:45,873 --> 00:05:49,866
- Cathy, I need Article 1, Section 2.
- Of what?

90
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:54,624
- The Constitution.
- I should have that at my desk?

91
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,064
Does anybody have a copy
of the Constitution?

92
00:05:58,673 --> 00:06:01,790
- This is discouraging.
- Bonnie, get Toby a copy.

93
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:06,671
- Is it still in print?
- For crying out loud! Try Amazon.com.

94
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:11,185
Or bust into the glass display
case at the National Archives!

95
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,906
You shouldn't yell.

96
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:16,628
"Is it still in print?"
my staff wants to know.

97
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,824
- I'm here to see Sam.
- Go ahead.

98
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:21,103
It's not a big deal.

99
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:25,101
- What do I care?
- Absolutely no reason that you should.

100
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:28,544
The president will veto any bill
prohibiting...

101
00:06:28,753 --> 00:06:31,790
...sampling data as a component
of the 2000 census.

102
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:35,224
Just a preview of what
you'll get with Toby.

103
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,028
Yeah, I'll see you then.

104
00:06:38,953 --> 00:06:42,104
- That was great, what you said.
- What'd I say?

105
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:46,226
- Well, the way you said it.
- The census must be taken seriously.

106
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:50,187
- Tell me about it.
- It's not glamorous, but, you know?

107
00:06:51,113 --> 00:06:52,307
You need something?

108
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,305
- Did you get a haircut?
- No.

109
00:06:54,553 --> 00:06:58,546
- You look good today.
- Thank you. You too.

110
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,550
- New suit?
- No.

111
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,947
You look good.

112
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:04,269
- What you need, C.J.?
- A tutor.

113
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:05,906
A tutor? What for?

114
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:11,824
The commerce bill for the census.
There are parts I don't understand.

115
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:14,103
- Which parts?
- All of it.

116
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,507
- All of it?
- Yes.

117
00:07:15,753 --> 00:07:18,313
- You don't understand?
- Certain nuances.

118
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,071
- Like what?
- The census.

119
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,822
I hear you talk about the census
all the time.

120
00:07:24,353 --> 00:07:27,789
- Yeah.
- I don't understand, how can you--?

121
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,109
- I fake it.
- You fake it?

122
00:07:30,313 --> 00:07:35,546
I've played it fast and loose,
but reading the briefing book...

123
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:40,508
...I have to say, the census is starting
to sound like it's important.

124
00:07:40,713 --> 00:07:46,151
I realize if I'm gonna talk about it
I should understand what I'm saying.

125
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:47,991
- When?
- When what?

126
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:51,629
- When did you realize this?
- About an hour ago.

127
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:58,105
Let's forget that you're late to the
party and be glad that you did come.

128
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:01,703
- That's what I say.
- We'll start at lunch.

129
00:08:01,953 --> 00:08:03,432
- You faked it?
- Yes.

130
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,589
- The president--
- I shouldn't have.

131
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,351
- You think?
- See you later.

132
00:08:08,153 --> 00:08:10,462
- I have a question.
- About what?

133
00:08:10,873 --> 00:08:12,272
- Budget surplus.
- Okay.

134
00:08:12,473 --> 00:08:14,225
It's a $30 billion surplus.

135
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:16,469
- 32 billion.
- Whatever.

136
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:18,629
- You know what they say.
- What?

137
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:22,109
A billion here, billion there,
it adds up.

138
00:08:22,313 --> 00:08:25,066
- Nifty saying, Josh.
- I didn't coin it.

139
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,946
This is the first time
in three decades.

140
00:08:28,153 --> 00:08:30,872
Republicans want to use it
for tax relief.

141
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:34,349
They want to give back the money.
Why don't we?

142
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:37,829
- We're Democrats.
- It's not the government's money.

143
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:41,025
- It's in our account.
- We took more than we needed.

144
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:42,586
- I want mine.
- Sorry.

145
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,182
- We're not done with this.
- I know.

146
00:08:45,393 --> 00:08:49,147
$12 million for an Appalachian
Transportation Institute.

147
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:54,029
$1.5 million to study parking
facilities at commercial truck stops.

148
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:58,545
$3 million to produce a documentary
on highway infrastructure.

149
00:08:58,753 --> 00:09:03,952
These are just some of today's
additions to the appropriations bill.

150
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:09,181
$2 million for a volcano monitor
in Alaska to warn airplanes about ash.

151
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:11,543
The FAA doesn't know what that is.

152
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:15,632
$550,000 for New York to restore
the home of Susan B. Anthony.

153
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,791
The tile in my shower
could use re-grouting.

154
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,223
Remind me what's in this for us.

155
00:09:21,433 --> 00:09:25,028
Federal funding for 100,000
new public school teachers.

156
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,542
- Thank you.
- How's this working?

157
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:32,190
We meet Gladman and Skinner,
two of the three swing votes.

158
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:34,111
In terms of the census?

159
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:38,829
Yes. They drop the sampling
prohibition, appropriations passes.

160
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:40,864
- Who's the third?
- The third?

161
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,866
You said 3 swing votes.
Gladman, Skinner--

162
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:45,944
- Janice Willis' husband.
- Right.

163
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,428
- He'll do what we say.
- We're fine.

164
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:49,827
You sure?

165
00:09:50,033 --> 00:09:53,662
It's a 3-day weekend,
congressmen want to go home.

166
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,222
- That will do it?
- I know it will.

167
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:58,708
- What time is the meeting?
- 11:00.

168
00:09:59,793 --> 00:10:04,071
Just don't do anything to screw up
or in any way embarrass me.

169
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,101
- Leo, Knute Rockne. I get 'em mixed up.
- Go.

170
00:10:08,313 --> 00:10:10,827
If they hop the fence they go to jail.

171
00:10:11,033 --> 00:10:14,708
What they do once we get to them
determines for how long.

172
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:18,508
- What tripped the alarm?
- The alarms are in the ground.

173
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,825
Here, here and here.
She tripped it here.

174
00:10:22,033 --> 00:10:23,546
- She?
- Yes, sir.

175
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,232
It wasn't a fraternity?

176
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:29,221
It was a mentally unbalanced
woman in her 40s.

177
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:33,790
Trying to kill me isn't evidence
of being mentally unbalanced.

178
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:37,030
She stated that you weren't the target.

179
00:10:37,473 --> 00:10:39,225
- I wasn't?
- No, sir.

180
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:41,389
- Who was?
- Your daughter.

181
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,702
- Zoey?
- Yes, sir.

182
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:46,188
Leo.

183
00:10:46,393 --> 00:10:48,623
- Good morning.
- You know Ron.

184
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:50,346
- It was a woman.
- Yes.

185
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:53,989
- We're still in review.
- I'll get a report.

186
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:57,868
If I may be excused,
I could make a call....

187
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:00,667
- Of course, help yourself.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:05,463
- She was after Zoey?
- There were 8 security checks...

189
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:08,665
...between the woman
and Zoey's room.

190
00:11:10,553 --> 00:11:13,306
There's no need for Zoey
to know, right?

191
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,309
- What do you need?
- This may be the wrong time...

192
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,469
...but I wanted to talk--

193
00:11:19,673 --> 00:11:23,382
Last night you mentioned
I should say hello to Jenny--

194
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:26,027
- Hang on. Ron?
- Our security worked...

195
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,986
...exactly the way it's supposed to.

196
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:32,265
- I guess that's something.
- You'll send a report?

197
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:33,428
In two hours.

198
00:11:33,633 --> 00:11:35,464
- You were saying?
- It can wait.

199
00:11:35,673 --> 00:11:37,948
- You sure?
- Yeah. Goodbye, Ron.

200
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,462
- See you in an hour.
- All right.

201
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,863
I guess we're done too.

202
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:46,663
- I wouldn't lose sleep over it, sir.
- No, no.

203
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:50,265
- Good seeing you, Mr. President.
- You too.

204
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:54,030
- Ron.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:11:54,353 --> 00:11:57,663
- Did she have a gun?
- Yes, sir.

206
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:01,393
Okay. Thank you.

207
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:19,507
- Josh, good to see you.
- Congressman.

208
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:24,102
Mandy, I should have brought
my sword and shield.

209
00:12:24,313 --> 00:12:26,622
Champagne and flowers would do.

210
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,983
- Have you met Joe Willis?
- No.

211
00:12:29,193 --> 00:12:31,582
- My wife was Janice Willis.
- I know.

212
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,388
She passed away.
I've taken her seat in Congress.

213
00:12:35,593 --> 00:12:37,424
We're sorry for your loss.

214
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,592
The White House sent flowers.
The president wrote a note.

215
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:43,704
Could you give him my thanks?

216
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:46,825
- Sure, congressman.
- I'm not a congressman.

217
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:51,072
I teach eighth-grade social studies.
This is only temporary--

218
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,828
Good morning. Everyone got food?
Got bagels? Good.

219
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:58,628
Christopher, Anthony, would you
mind putting my copy...

220
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,826
...of the appropriations bill on the
table, please?

221
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,912
Thank you, Christopher.
Thank you, Anthony.

222
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:08,910
And thank you, Cathy.

223
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:13,948
Congressman Skinner, welcome.
Congressman Gladman, good to see you.

224
00:13:14,153 --> 00:13:17,304
Congressman Willis,
I was a fan of your wife.

225
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:18,702
Thank you.

226
00:13:18,953 --> 00:13:23,344
This represents the latest draft
of the House Appropriations Bill.

227
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:27,910
It is 7000 pages long
and weighs over 55 pounds.

228
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:32,868
It includes $1.2 million for
a lettuce geneticist in California...

229
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:37,550
...and $1.7 million for manure handling
in Mississippi.

230
00:13:37,753 --> 00:13:39,232
That's what happens.

231
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:43,790
Eight states will divide $5 million
to research the uses of wood.

232
00:13:43,993 --> 00:13:47,383
- We saw that one.
- I'm thinking of uses for it now.

233
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,390
Let's talk about the census.

234
00:13:49,593 --> 00:13:54,223
The White House just wanted to
say that you're criminals and despots.

235
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,264
- Thank you.
- No problem.

236
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:59,271
That won't stop the president
from signing.

237
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,670
No, it won't. What will
stop him from signing...

238
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:05,825
...is the amendment you
offer on the census.

239
00:14:06,033 --> 00:14:08,672
You three represent the swing vote.

240
00:14:08,873 --> 00:14:12,388
Drop the amendment,
the appropriations bill passes.

241
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:16,472
Insist on prohibiting sampling,
and count on a long fight...

242
00:14:16,673 --> 00:14:18,868
...followed by a veto.

243
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:25,262
I have no conscience when it comes to
exploiting the fact that you have...

244
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:28,829
...nonrefundable airline tickets
for the weekend.

245
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,342
- With that in mind--
- Excuse me.

246
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,427
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not leaving town.

247
00:14:35,713 --> 00:14:38,352
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not leaving this weekend.

248
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:41,431
I'm staying to see
some of Janice's friends.

249
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:47,868
There's no need to rush on my account.
Take as much time as you like.

250
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:56,109
Good. Then, let's talk.

251
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:00,791
- You'll go slowly?
- Yes.

252
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:05,464
- Pretend that I'm dumb.
- Let me conjure that image--

253
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:09,871
- I'm coming to you exposed.
- I'm coming to your office.

254
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:15,227
I meant symbolically. I'm saying,
"I don't know this, will you teach me?"

255
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:20,951
- It's hard to admit that.
- What exactly do you want me to do?

256
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:25,066
I'm admitting to you that
there are things I do not know.

257
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:30,108
I don't think anybody would have
any trouble imagining that.

258
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:31,871
Explain it to me.

259
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:35,503
- Every 10 years we count everybody.
- Why?

260
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:41,225
Representation at the various levels
of government is based on population.

261
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,711
To find out how many congressmen
a state gets, we count the people.

262
00:15:45,913 --> 00:15:49,906
If the book had been
that clear I would've understood.

263
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:51,984
- We're not done yet.
- Okay.

264
00:15:52,193 --> 00:15:56,391
The decennial census is done
by a door-to-door head count.

265
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:59,312
Some 950,000 professionals are hired.

266
00:15:59,513 --> 00:16:03,028
The process costs
approximately $6.9 billion.

267
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,985
It's also very inaccurate.

268
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:08,549
It tends to be disadvantageous
to inner-city...

269
00:16:08,753 --> 00:16:12,746
...and recent immigrant populations
and to the homeless.

270
00:16:12,953 --> 00:16:15,148
I want you to know that in this--

271
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:17,821
- Your time of vulnerability?
- Yes.

272
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:21,582
- I appreciate it.
- We're not done yet.

273
00:16:25,793 --> 00:16:28,512
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Daddy.

274
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,622
- Can you stay long?
- No, I brought you stuff from home.

275
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:37,951
- You didn't have to.
- I wanted you to have stuff you like.

276
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,713
- I'm fine.
- You're okay at the hotel?

277
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:42,904
I wanted Mom to have the house.

278
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:45,911
But you're gonna look
for a place, right?

279
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:49,702
Mallory, this thing with
your mother and me will blow over.

280
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:54,668
No, it won't, Dad.
You understand that, right?

281
00:16:56,953 --> 00:17:00,548
This is not amortized,
it's a one-time experiment.

282
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,746
This is a partisan issue.
The Democrats want the House.

283
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:09,344
- I'm not going to deny that.
- It's like you lost the battle--

284
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,785
- Did he say what it was about?
- Why shouldn't I get my money back?

285
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:16,268
- You won't spend it right.
- What?

286
00:17:16,473 --> 00:17:19,909
I wanna combine your money
with everybody else's...

287
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:24,431
...and pay down the debt
and further endow social security.

288
00:17:24,633 --> 00:17:27,909
- What will you do with it?
- Buy a DVD player.

289
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:33,346
But my $700 helps employ people who
produce and sell DVDs and DVD players.

290
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:39,310
- Natural evolution of a market economy.
- But the DVD player is made in Japan.

291
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:42,152
- I'll buy American.
- We don't trust you.

292
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,311
- I want my money.
- Shouldn't have voted for us.

293
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:46,548
- Charlie.
- Hey.

294
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:51,269
- I got a message he needed to see me.
- Yeah, go on in.

295
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:52,662
Yes.

296
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:55,072
Yes.

297
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:58,064
Yes, of course.

298
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:04,502
I'm on with the postmaster general.

299
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:07,022
- What's it about?
- I don't know.

300
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,110
- Do me a favor.
- Of course.

301
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:11,309
Take Charlie out for a beer.

302
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:14,311
- Take him out for a beer?
- He has no life.

303
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:19,268
Take him out, come back, then
we'll watch the vote in Leo's office.

304
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:21,788
- Sure.
- I'll give you some cash.

305
00:18:21,993 --> 00:18:23,949
- No, sir--
- Don't be silly.

306
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,905
- I have money.
- Sure?

307
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,865
I don't have any cash on me.

308
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:30,229
- It's fine.
- I don't carry cash.

309
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:33,391
- I don't carry keys either.
- You don't need to.

310
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:36,312
- How's it going in there?
- We'll see.

311
00:18:36,513 --> 00:18:39,471
- I appreciate it.
- Yes, sir.

312
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:46,025
- Charlie. You got plans tonight?
- No.

313
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:49,270
- What about your sister?
- She's at a friend's. Why?

314
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:53,989
Let's get a beer. We'll go to a bar,
speak as men do.

315
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:56,024
- We will?
- Yeah.

316
00:18:56,233 --> 00:19:00,670
- What kind of bar is this, Josh?
- No, no, it's fine.

317
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:02,505
- Okay.
- Great.

318
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:05,750
Aren't you too old
to be leering at coeds?

319
00:19:05,953 --> 00:19:08,513
I'm a Fulbright scholar, I don't leer.

320
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,511
- There will be grad students.
- Well, good.

321
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:13,669
- So I'll come get you.
- Okay.

322
00:19:13,873 --> 00:19:14,908
Josh.

323
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:17,064
- Hey.
- Take us with you.

324
00:19:17,273 --> 00:19:19,423
- Where?
- Out tonight, with Charlie.

325
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,863
- How do you know about it?
- My Dad.

326
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:25,383
- He said to take us.
- He's like a camp counselor.

327
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:27,265
- Take us with you.
- No.

328
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:29,265
- Why?
- This is among men.

329
00:19:29,473 --> 00:19:31,543
You can flirt with coeds.

330
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:36,907
- There's gonna be grad students there.
- It sounded like an order, Josh.

331
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,831
- Fine.
- Bring Sam Seaborn.

332
00:19:39,033 --> 00:19:42,912
Sam's got enough going on
without you making a booty call.

333
00:19:43,113 --> 00:19:47,903
We had a conversation that got
interrupted, I'd like to finish it.

334
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,951
- Whatever.
- This is gonna be fun.

335
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:56,147
President's daughter, chief of staff's
daughter, Georgetown bar and Sam.

336
00:19:56,393 --> 00:19:58,111
What could possibly go wrong?

337
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,904
- What's wrong with a head count?
- They're inaccurate.

338
00:20:06,113 --> 00:20:08,308
- Why?
- How do you count the homeless?

339
00:20:08,513 --> 00:20:11,027
A lot of people don't speak English.

340
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:17,103
Lots of people don't wanna answer
questions when you knock on their door.

341
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:20,908
Sampling is a more effective way
to get a good census.

342
00:20:21,113 --> 00:20:22,785
What's the legal argument?

343
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:26,668
The argument is, it's unconstitutional,
against the law.

344
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:32,510
If it's really against the law,
why pass legislation saying so?

345
00:20:32,713 --> 00:20:37,070
- Isn't it good to understand?
- And I don't have to be patronizing.

346
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:39,622
- What about, "You look good"?
- Over it.

347
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:43,712
Sam. Taking Charlie for a beer.
Zoey and Mallory too.

348
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:45,625
- Sounds good.
- I like beer.

349
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,142
If you wanna come,
I guess it's okay.

350
00:20:48,353 --> 00:20:52,790
- Josh, you've swept me off my feet.
- Whatever. I'll see you later.

351
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:57,430
In the last census, 8 million people,
mostly black, weren't counted.

352
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:01,308
Four million, mostly white,
were counted twice.

353
00:21:01,513 --> 00:21:04,630
Sampling will give
a more realistic count...

354
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:09,031
...for 4 billion dollars less
than a door-to-door head count.

355
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:13,226
Sampling costs 2.7 billion.
An inaccurate head count, 6.9.

356
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:17,221
Even the Census Bureau,
a bipartisan commission, says:

357
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,549
"Sampling is better."

358
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:24,543
We've heard these arguments,
but we have a constitution.

359
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:26,106
We know.

360
00:21:26,313 --> 00:21:28,827
- The Constitution's clear on this.
- No.

361
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:31,467
Until the court rules that sampling--

362
00:21:31,673 --> 00:21:35,951
- The article is arcane.
- Toby, the article is not arcane.

363
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:37,906
Let's look at it.

364
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:41,708
- No, we don't have time--
- Let's take a look at it!

365
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:45,349
- No one's a constitutional scholar--
- It won't take long.

366
00:21:45,553 --> 00:21:48,113
- We've unearthed a copy.
- Come on--

367
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:51,982
- Would you read Article 1, Section 2?
- This is silly.

368
00:21:52,193 --> 00:21:55,469
It is the owner's manual,
we should read it.

369
00:21:55,713 --> 00:22:00,946
"Representatives and direct taxes shall
be apportioned among...

370
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,668
...the states of this union,
according to their numbers...

371
00:22:04,873 --> 00:22:09,628
...which is determined by adding
the whole number of persons."

372
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:15,064
It says, "which shall be determined
by the whole number of persons."

373
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:17,349
"The whole number of persons."

374
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:22,866
Not what some statistician got off
of a computer. It says so right there.

375
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:26,588
- Actually, that's not what it says.
- What do you mean?

376
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:30,547
Mandy left out a few words,
didn't she, Mr. Willis?

377
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:32,427
Yes.

378
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:37,502
Mr. Willis teaches eighth-grade social
studies. He knows the article.

379
00:22:37,713 --> 00:22:42,503
It says, "determined by adding
the whole number of free persons...

380
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:45,705
...and three-fifths of all other persons."

381
00:22:45,913 --> 00:22:49,952
- They meant you, Mr. Willis, right?
- Yes.

382
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:53,225
You want to enact a law
limiting the ability...

383
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:57,984
...of those people who need to be
counted most, to be counted at all.

384
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:03,870
Their only refuge is the argument that
Article 1, Section 2 is not arcane.

385
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:12,389
I can report to the chairman
of my committee, but I don't think he...

386
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:17,303
...nor the leadership, is going
to allow us to change our vote.

387
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:21,028
You are talking about tying up
an appropriations--

388
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,112
We don't need you to tell us.
And waiting till the final hour--

389
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:28,510
This is the fourth time
we've arranged this--

390
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:30,863
I will.

391
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,193
- What, sir?
- I think we should drop it.

392
00:23:34,393 --> 00:23:36,782
- Joe--
- That's my choice, right?

393
00:23:36,993 --> 00:23:39,063
The chairman recommends--

394
00:23:39,273 --> 00:23:44,393
I saw what he recommended,
but it's still my choice, right?

395
00:23:44,593 --> 00:23:49,144
- Absolutely, sir, it is your choice.
- Well, then I change my mind.

396
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:55,747
We should drop the census amendment.
Let the appropriation bill pass, as is.

397
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:59,992
Until the court rules on
whether sampling is constitutional.

398
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:01,831
Well, then....

399
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,787
Excellent.

400
00:24:04,593 --> 00:24:10,065
- You snuck one in the back door, Toby.
- I go through whatever door is open.

401
00:24:10,713 --> 00:24:13,785
- We're going to have to revisit this.
- Yes.

402
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:19,351
- Do you need help finding the way out?
- No, thank you. I think I can manage.

403
00:24:20,913 --> 00:24:23,302
Thank you, gentlemen.

404
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:25,105
Thank you.

405
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,871
Go tell Leo.

406
00:24:31,873 --> 00:24:35,149
- Mr. Willis.
- You can call me Joe.

407
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:38,265
If you don't mind,
what changed your mind?

408
00:24:38,633 --> 00:24:42,228
- What do you mean?
- Well, I know it wasn't expediency.

409
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:46,108
- I wonder what changed your mind.
- You did.

410
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:50,670
- I thought you made a strong argument.
- Thank you.

411
00:24:52,833 --> 00:24:55,791
I smile because here,
the merits of an argument...

412
00:24:55,993 --> 00:24:58,951
...generally take a back seat
to political tactics.

413
00:24:59,153 --> 00:25:01,189
I would imagine.

414
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:05,672
- It worked on me.
- I was taking advantage of you.

415
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:09,070
- I know.
- I didn't mention some things.

416
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:11,031
First, it is partisan.

417
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:13,701
Second, I'm not wild
about the precedent.

418
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:14,982
You mean--

419
00:25:15,193 --> 00:25:17,024
What's to stop us from saying:

420
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,862
"We don't need elections,
we'll just use polling data.

421
00:25:21,073 --> 00:25:24,986
A sampling of people will decide
who runs the country"?

422
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:27,832
- I thought about that.
- And?

423
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:30,469
It's okay by me...

424
00:25:30,673 --> 00:25:36,270
...as long as it's not the same people
who decide what's on television.

425
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:42,588
Toby, I'm not nearly
as smart as my wife was.

426
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:46,908
I went to night school
because I went to work pretty young.

427
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:51,823
I tried to understand the things
Janice brought home from the office...

428
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:54,501
...but I wasn't in her league.

429
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:58,672
I never understood what she wanted
with a dummy like me.

430
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:03,944
I think the problems we're going
to face in the new century...

431
00:26:04,153 --> 00:26:07,862
...are far beyond the wisdom
of Solomon, let alone me.

432
00:26:08,953 --> 00:26:12,582
But I think the right place to start
is to say:

433
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:17,344
"Fair is fair. This is who we are.

434
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:20,268
These are our numbers."

435
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:24,911
I'm sorry I never got
to know your wife.

436
00:26:25,153 --> 00:26:28,623
- She would have liked you.
- Thank you.

437
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,669
I've got a roll call.

438
00:26:32,873 --> 00:26:36,468
Nothing to it. They call your name,
you vote yea.

439
00:26:37,033 --> 00:26:41,709
Well, this is my first,
and likely my only, vote...

440
00:26:41,953 --> 00:26:44,831
...in the House of Representatives.

441
00:26:45,033 --> 00:26:47,945
- Good luck, congressman.
- Thank you.

442
00:26:57,433 --> 00:27:00,664
- You wanted to read these with dinner.
- Thanks.

443
00:27:00,873 --> 00:27:03,068
- And the Tokyo Exchange?
- Sure.

444
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,582
- The call from the secretary?
- Yes.

445
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:10,021
- You'll take it in the dining room?
- Wherever I am.

446
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:13,305
- No need to adopt a tone.
- I'm not.

447
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:16,465
- Anything else, sir?
- I want to go home.

448
00:27:16,713 --> 00:27:18,590
- There's that tone again.
- Sir?

449
00:27:18,793 --> 00:27:21,432
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

450
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:22,861
I heard it's done.

451
00:27:23,113 --> 00:27:27,231
The amendment stays in committee.
Appropriations will pass.

452
00:27:27,433 --> 00:27:31,984
- Good. I'm headed to the residence.
- I needed to speak to you.

453
00:27:33,393 --> 00:27:36,465
I should've told you earlier, but--

454
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:40,791
I moved out of the house.

455
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:45,305
- Jenny's asking me for a divorce.
- You're kidding me.

456
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:48,825
- Leo, you're kidding.
- No.

457
00:27:49,993 --> 00:27:51,142
What happened?

458
00:27:52,073 --> 00:27:53,984
Nothing happened, Mr. President--

459
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:58,072
Don't tell me nothing happened.
I know you, I know Jenny.

460
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:02,829
- Married couples like you don't--
- It's not like that.

461
00:28:04,193 --> 00:28:06,946
- I want to talk to Jenny.
- Feel free.

462
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:11,788
- I don't understand. You were happy.
- Jenny wasn't happy.

463
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:15,190
Because you weren't spending
enough time with her?

464
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:18,465
- Yes, but that's not--
- Marriage needs attention.

465
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:20,584
It can't run on autopilot.

466
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:24,786
It's not your prom date we're
talking about, it's your family!

467
00:28:24,993 --> 00:28:28,144
I tried to squeeze in as much time
as I could...

468
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:32,471
...between my wine-tasting club
and running your White House.

469
00:28:32,673 --> 00:28:35,392
You can't blame this on me.

470
00:28:35,593 --> 00:28:39,552
I'm not blaming you, sir.
I'm not blaming anyone for it.

471
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:43,746
- It just happened. Things happen.
- When did it happen?

472
00:28:44,713 --> 00:28:47,386
- Two weeks ago.
- You're just now telling me?

473
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:53,112
I know how you feel about Jenny.
I thought you might feel responsible...

474
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:59,104
...and you'd turn that guilt into
an inappropriate anger toward me.

475
00:28:59,313 --> 00:29:02,464
I can't imagine
what made me think all that.

476
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,782
- Fix this.
- It's not that simple.

477
00:29:05,993 --> 00:29:09,463
It is that simple.
You're the man, fix it.

478
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,467
- Mr. President--
- Fix it.

479
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:18,469
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Leo.

480
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,468
So, your friend couldn't come?

481
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,267
By friend, of course, you mean....

482
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:39,623
- Your special friend.
- Does she--?

483
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,789
- My special friend.
- What friend?

484
00:29:41,993 --> 00:29:46,191
- His friend that Zoey can't know about.
- The hooker.

485
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:52,427
Not a hooker, she's a call girl.
How do you know about it?

486
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:56,262
- Mallory told me.
- How does Mallory know about that?

487
00:29:56,473 --> 00:30:00,182
- I told her.
- You told our boss's daughter that?

488
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:04,102
At the time, I thought
she was a schoolteacher.

489
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:09,467
- So you were telling a stranger you--
- Accidentally slept with a call girl.

490
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:12,710
- Mallory, does your father know?
- No.

491
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:16,021
Zoey, does your father know?

492
00:30:16,753 --> 00:30:19,551
- Not yet.
- So this is gonna be a thing.

493
00:30:19,753 --> 00:30:24,668
Zoey and I have decided that it's time
we start collecting IOUs.

494
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,662
- She didn't bring my grasshopper.
- No?

495
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:32,747
- Maybe she felt stupid ordering it.
- It's a perfectly--

496
00:30:32,953 --> 00:30:34,306
- I'll get it.
- I will.

497
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:36,271
I wanna see them make it.

498
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:38,504
- Could you hold these?
- What?

499
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,431
Just stuff. My panic button.

500
00:30:40,633 --> 00:30:43,067
- Ruins the line of my outfit.
- Got it.

501
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:44,911
- A grasshopper?
- Straight up.

502
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:47,104
Make sure it's thick and green.

503
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:51,508
- What's a panic button?
- You don't wanna know.

504
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:54,307
The president is very protective.

505
00:30:56,113 --> 00:30:59,071
- Having a good time?
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

506
00:30:59,953 --> 00:31:03,912
- Seems like you're not.
- He's having a good time.

507
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:06,502
Think they know I'm not in college?

508
00:31:06,713 --> 00:31:08,431
- Who?
- These people.

509
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,864
- You're twice as smart.
- But I'm not in college.

510
00:31:12,113 --> 00:31:13,228
Relax.

511
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,903
- You say that with a sense of urgency.
- I just want--

512
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:19,468
- You relax.
- I'm not being urgent.

513
00:31:25,673 --> 00:31:27,823
- Hey.
- Hey.

514
00:31:28,873 --> 00:31:32,070
- What's your name?
- What?

515
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:35,462
I said, what's your name?

516
00:31:36,073 --> 00:31:39,861
- You're kidding, right?
- He's just asking for your name.

517
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:43,307
Wait. Why don't we guess your name?

518
00:31:43,513 --> 00:31:45,629
- All right?
- Sure.

519
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:47,551
I bet we can guess it.

520
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:53,066
There wasn't urgency in my voice.
I asked if he was having a good time.

521
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:56,071
Maybe if you'd stop pestering him--

522
00:31:56,273 --> 00:31:58,264
Excuse me a second.

523
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:01,023
- It's Cassandra.
- Cassandra?

524
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:03,224
We were gonna guess!

525
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,187
- You okay, Zoey?
- You called her Zoey.

526
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,746
Let's go.

527
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:12,306
What's up, Sammy?

528
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:17,901
Excuse me. We're trying
to buy a girl a drink, man.

529
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:20,229
She's 19 years old, man.

530
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,788
- Check out Superfly.
- Hey.

531
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,907
- Let's go.
- Why don't you go, all right?

532
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:28,946
You don't know who this is. Be cool.

533
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:31,223
- Be cool?
- I'm just saying--

534
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:35,551
- I know, you want me to be cool.
- Can I buy you a round?

535
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:38,551
Like LL Cool J. Like Ice T.

536
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:40,903
Ice Cube. Ice Tray, man.

537
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:43,468
Why must you mock a natural--?

538
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:48,542
I'm not mocking it, Josh. I'm saying
maybe if you left him alone--

539
00:32:48,753 --> 00:32:51,267
- Josh?
- I don't know.

540
00:32:53,353 --> 00:32:55,309
Why don't you do some hip-hop?

541
00:32:55,553 --> 00:32:57,783
Dr. Huffy Puffy Dred, man--

542
00:32:57,993 --> 00:33:01,872
- Let us by, please?
- What are you doing with this girl?

543
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:05,827
- You look to be Dr. Faggot.
- What the hell's going on?

544
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:08,149
- Who are you?
- Kiss my ass. Zoey?

545
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,389
- I'm fine.
- Kiss your what?

546
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:12,106
- Charlie?
- It's fine.

547
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:13,706
You wanna go?

548
00:33:13,913 --> 00:33:16,507
- Right now.
- How's everybody doing?

549
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:19,068
Oh, good, more fairy boys.

550
00:33:19,313 --> 00:33:22,430
- Excuse me?
- I said more fairy boys!

551
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,430
This is too good to be true.

552
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,705
I recognize him.
She looks familiar too.

553
00:33:27,913 --> 00:33:30,791
You don't realize
you're having a bad night.

554
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:32,904
Really? Who's giving it to us?

555
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,265
Federal agents!

556
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,469
Right here.

557
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:43,665
Shut up.

558
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,869
I'll blow your head off.

559
00:33:46,073 --> 00:33:47,904
Everybody stand back.

560
00:33:48,513 --> 00:33:52,984
- I ain't done with you, Sammy.
- My name is Charlie Young, jackass.

561
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:58,267
If that's blow in your pocket,
you're spending spring break in prison.

562
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:06,062
Now I'm having a good time.

563
00:34:07,793 --> 00:34:10,466
Well, my work here is done.

564
00:34:11,673 --> 00:34:14,665
- What happened?
- They told you what happened.

565
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:18,229
- Did you do anything to provoke them?
- Like what?

566
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,264
- Were you flirting?
- Dad.

567
00:34:20,473 --> 00:34:24,102
- You flirt with guys.
- Yes, Dad, I am 19 years old.

568
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:26,224
I was not flirting.

569
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:30,472
Even if I was, it wasn't
justification for their behavior.

570
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:33,062
- What then?
- I went to get a drink.

571
00:34:33,313 --> 00:34:36,350
- Why were you drinking?
- It was for C.J.

572
00:34:37,113 --> 00:34:39,308
- I'm gonna up your protection.
- No.

573
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:42,863
- Starting tomorrow.
- I start college in a month.

574
00:34:43,073 --> 00:34:46,952
- Some friends will walk you to class.
- I don't want this.

575
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,871
- I am entitled to this part of my life.
- You're getting it.

576
00:34:52,113 --> 00:34:54,547
- I'm entitled to a--
- Oh, please.

577
00:34:54,753 --> 00:34:57,586
- Don't "Oh, please" me.
- The Secret Service--

578
00:34:57,793 --> 00:35:02,025
- They should worry about you getting shot.
- They are worried.

579
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,464
But not compared
to how terrified we are of you.

580
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:09,262
You scare the Secret Service,
and you scare me.

581
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:13,546
My getting killed
is not the nightmare scenario.

582
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:16,745
The nightmare is you getting kidnapped.

583
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:20,389
You go to a bar
and you go to the restroom...

584
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:24,586
...somebody comes up from behind,
and whisks you out the door.

585
00:35:24,793 --> 00:35:27,261
You're so scared, you don't notice...

586
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:32,183
...the two dead agents on the ground.
You're whisked away in a car.

587
00:35:32,393 --> 00:35:34,987
It's a big party with lots of noise.

588
00:35:35,193 --> 00:35:38,902
It's a half-hour before
someone says, "Where's Zoey?"

589
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:41,263
15 minutes later they call.

590
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:45,261
It's another hour before
they shut down the airports.

591
00:35:45,473 --> 00:35:47,111
And now we're off!

592
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:50,111
You're tied to a chair in a shack
in Uganda.

593
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:56,627
I'm told I have 72 hours to get Israel
to free 460 terrorist prisoners.

594
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:01,031
So, I'm pleading with Ben Yahbin,
who says, "Sorry, Mr. President...

595
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:04,862
...lsrael simply does not
negotiate with terrorists."

596
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:07,507
Now we've got a new problem.

597
00:36:07,753 --> 00:36:10,313
This country no longer has a president.

598
00:36:10,513 --> 00:36:13,311
It has a scared father
whose little girl...

599
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:16,789
...is in a shack in Uganda
with a gun to her head!

600
00:36:16,993 --> 00:36:19,109
Do you get it?!

601
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:23,146
Yes.

602
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:37,870
I'm sorry I yelled. Forgive me.

603
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,393
I want you to have freedom,
your youth...

604
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:45,586
...and have everyday experiences
with girls your own age.

605
00:36:45,793 --> 00:36:48,466
But don't forget,
this is a privilege...

606
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:51,983
...and an experience
to be cherished beyond measure.

607
00:36:52,193 --> 00:36:56,744
And proper protection and security,
though at times, it's a drag...

608
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,865
...is never too high a price to pay.

609
00:37:00,753 --> 00:37:04,462
You're right. I'm sorry.

610
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:08,865
It's all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

611
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,665
Good night.

612
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,710
Good night, sweetheart.

613
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,467
- I love you.
- I love you too.

614
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:32,065
Don't get up.

615
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:36,544
Good evening, Mr. President.

616
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:38,752
Hi.

617
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:44,593
Before, when I was being an idiot,
there was something I forgot to say.

618
00:37:44,873 --> 00:37:46,067
What?

619
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,909
I'm sorry.

620
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:52,111
Thank you.

621
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:57,751
I'd like unanimous consent
to revise and extend my remarks.

622
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,352
Without objection.

623
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:02,386
I don't know what the hell
was wrong with me.

624
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,663
Anything I can do to help....

625
00:38:04,913 --> 00:38:06,665
Anything.

626
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,191
Thanks.

627
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:18,781
I could have taken
the two on the left.

628
00:38:18,993 --> 00:38:20,711
- They were mine.
- Which?

629
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:23,513
- The guys on the left.
- As you face the bar?

630
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:24,987
Yeah. No, no.

631
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,708
Say you're me,
facing the bar--

632
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:28,982
Sandwiches.

633
00:38:29,193 --> 00:38:31,707
Thanks. Defending virtue
is hungry work.

634
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,471
I'll be at my desk.

635
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,909
- Donna.
- Yes?

636
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,341
How much was lunch?

637
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:39,066
- $12.95.
- I gave you $20.

638
00:38:39,273 --> 00:38:42,390
Yes, as it turned out,
you gave me more money...

639
00:38:42,593 --> 00:38:45,710
...than I needed to buy what
you asked for.

640
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:49,309
However, I can't trust you
to spend the change wisely.

641
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:51,071
I've invested it for you.

642
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:55,022
- Nice. A little parable.
- I want my money back.

643
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:59,029
- So those are my guys.
- There's the one guy--

644
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,791
Facing the other way.

645
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:04,110
Neither one of you could have
taken two guys.

646
00:39:04,353 --> 00:39:06,867
- Josh.
- Yes, sir.

647
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:17,469
What were you doing taking
my daughter out to a bar?

648
00:39:19,913 --> 00:39:22,825
- You told me to.
- I told you to take Charlie.

649
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:27,026
When Zoey said she was going,
I assumed you'd go have malteds.

650
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:28,746
- Malteds, sir?
- Yes.

651
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,308
What is this, <i>Our Town</i>?

652
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:36,667
Anyway, thank you for doing
whatever it was you did.

653
00:39:36,913 --> 00:39:38,824
I didn't do anything.

654
00:39:39,033 --> 00:39:41,911
For what it's worth,
Charlie didn't blink...

655
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,264
...before he put his body
between danger and Zoey.

656
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:51,866
Charlie.

657
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,583
Sam, you come too, please.

658
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:02,664
I once played the stage manager
in a production of <i>Our Town.</i>

659
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:11,345
- Charlie, you a good poker player?
- No, sir.

660
00:40:11,553 --> 00:40:13,225
Excellent. Take a seat.

661
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,822
- Is Josh being punished?
- No.

662
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:19,264
- May I ask why not?
- Because I said so.

663
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:22,224
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

664
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:25,345
Good work, you two.
You bought us some time.

665
00:40:25,553 --> 00:40:28,784
I understand you all had
an interesting evening.

666
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,029
- So did I.
- What happened?

667
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:33,622
- I met an unusual man.
- C.J., deal.

668
00:40:34,113 --> 00:40:38,664
He didn't come with a political agenda,
with his mind made up.

669
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:41,871
He wanted to do what he thought
was best.

670
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:44,382
Didn't mind saying, "I don't know."

671
00:40:44,593 --> 00:40:48,427
I said "I don't know" to Sam.
I'm a better person for it.

672
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:51,067
I know everything about the census.

673
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:55,664
- You can ask me anything.
- How many people live in the U.S.?

674
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:04,269
There is some material
we haven't covered yet.

675
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:09,232
- Come on, Toby.
- I wanna watch this.

676
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:14,223
- We won it 40 votes ago.
- I just wanna hear this one.

677
00:41:14,433 --> 00:41:17,709
<i>Mr. Widen.</i>
<i>Mr. Widen of Pennsylvania votes yea.</i>

678
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:23,269
<i>Mr. Wilder.</i>
<i>Mr. Wilder of South Carolina votes yea.</i>

679
00:41:23,473 --> 00:41:27,512
<i>Mr. Willis.</i>
<i>Mr. Willis of Ohio votes yea.</i>

680
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:30,273
<i>Mr. Zantowski....</i>

681
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:16,142
