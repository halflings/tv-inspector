00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,008
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,566
Have you seen the first lady?

3
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:12,970
Do you know how many other people
I could have married?

4
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:16,051
I've been trying to
be a better boyfriend.

5
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:18,323
This is one of the times it's okay.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:22,128
- It's hard to tell the difference.
- Doesn't that suck for you?

7
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,882
- This is Gina Toscano.
- Zoey's got a new agent.

8
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:28,049
Walking around campus with a wire.

9
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,483
- White supremacists?
- I'm not sure.

10
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:32,968
But I know what I'm looking for
in a crowd.

11
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,767
Zoey, walk on the other side of me.

12
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:37,162
Thirty seconds.

13
00:00:39,413 --> 00:00:43,611
If you're nervous, I'll know
and mock you on national television.

14
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:47,362
People might think it's cruel
for me to mock a boy...

15
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:52,772
...who gets nervous talking in front
of millions of people, but I'll do it.

16
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:57,564
- I understand.
- Jeffrey, I was kidding.

17
00:00:57,813 --> 00:01:01,886
Now, if you do get nervous,
just look at me or your parents.

18
00:01:02,093 --> 00:01:05,403
But you won't get nervous.
If you do, I'll beat you up.

19
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:09,367
Not me, personally.
I have people to do it for me.

20
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,251
Ten seconds.

21
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:14,570
- I should have worn the gray suit.
- You're good.

22
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,565
And here we go.

23
00:01:18,013 --> 00:01:22,609
<i>25 minutes past the hour</i>
<i>and 42 degrees outside our studios.</i>

24
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:27,244
<i>Abigail Bartlet is no stranger</i>
<i>to the fight for children's health...</i>

25
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,763
<i>...and she's taken the time</i>
<i>to speak with us today.</i>

26
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:35,603
- Good morning.
<i>- You're speaking from the Mural Room.</i>

27
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:39,647
I'm here to introduce
this young man, Jeffrey Morgan.

28
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:43,732
Jeffrey helped open my eyes
to child labor exploitation.

29
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:48,449
<i>You started your organization because</i>
<i>of a pen pal who was in trouble.</i>

30
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,247
<i>- Yes.</i>
- When did Jeffrey happen?

31
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,409
- Sam.
- When did Jeffrey happen?

32
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,447
- I dug it up for her. You'll love him.
- Let's find out.

33
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,609
<i>Your organization, the Kids'--</i>

34
00:01:59,813 --> 00:02:03,010
<i>- The Children's Crusade.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

35
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:08,287
<i>The organization was created when</i>
<i>your pen pal was sold into slavery.</i>

36
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:11,530
<i>It's not what it's called</i>
<i>in India, but that's what it is.</i>

37
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:16,329
<i>Panshin's mother borrowed $25 and</i>
<i>Panshin had to work to pay the loan.</i>

38
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,727
He's good.

39
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,970
<i>She borrowed the money</i>
<i>from a loan shark.</i>

40
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:25,883
<i>Then Panshin worked for the loan</i>
<i>shark but couldn't pay the loan.</i>

41
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:27,765
- Here's my thing.
- What?

42
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:33,684
What if the president brings the
leadership here for the budget talks?

43
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:36,361
- Why?
- We want the news cycle.

44
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:42,370
She's got the National Press Club
tomorrow. We want the news cycle.

45
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:46,612
- It doesn't belong to us.
- You know what I'm talking about.

46
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:50,886
We want the president going
to Congress for a compromise.

47
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:56,042
- He's in a car. He's not Henry Clay.
- It's a symbol.

48
00:02:56,253 --> 00:03:01,168
Your guy steps out of a car and it's
above the fold. My guy's on page 23.

49
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:05,201
Our guy won an election.
Something you have to get used to.

50
00:03:05,453 --> 00:03:09,731
Your guy has a 48% approval rating.
My guy's at 61. And bite me.

51
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,844
Point well argued.

52
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:17,372
<i>Mrs. Bartlet, does the company know</i>
<i>its contractors are using child labor?</i>

53
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:22,772
<i>If not, they're criminally negligent.</i>
<i>If they do, they're simply criminal.</i>

54
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,973
- There it is.
- That was a good pitch to hit.

55
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:29,051
Come on, see Toby.
Give us some room to run.

56
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:32,404
Change the channel.
Hi. Turn to channel 5.

57
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,047
- What happened?
- Bernie Dahl died.

58
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:37,323
<i>- -in darkness and silence.</i>

59
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,851
<i>- -suffering a massive heart attack...</i>

60
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,926
<i>... was pronounced dead</i>
<i>at John Hopkins.</i>

61
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:49,167
<i>The chief architect in the longest</i>
<i>economic expansion in history...</i>

62
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:53,685
<i>... was in his second term</i>
<i>as chairman of the Federal Reserve.</i>

63
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:55,611
You lost your news cycle.

64
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,327
- Is there gonna be a coup?
- Excuse me?

65
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,489
- Is there gonna be a coup?
- No.

66
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:51,290
We believe they'll appoint successors
from many groups, including the Ibo.

67
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,245
They've been complaining.

68
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:56,490
- This is on page...?
- 17 in the classified book.

69
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:59,890
- Page 17.
- Excuse me, Mr. President.

70
00:05:00,893 --> 00:05:02,724
Excuse me, please.

71
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:11,451
Intelligence briefings. Sometimes I
just nod my head. That can't be good.

72
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:14,332
Bernie Dahl had a heart attack.

73
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:18,003
He died about an hour ago
on the way to the hospital.

74
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:20,329
- Bad timing.
- I'll say.

75
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,763
- Who knows?
- We got it off the news.

76
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:26,522
- Market's gonna open 200 points down.
- If we're lucky.

77
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,651
- When's the last time we were lucky?
- Super Tuesday.

78
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:31,571
It's gonna be 300, 350.

79
00:05:31,813 --> 00:05:34,964
- Announce Ron Erlich.
- Not yet.

80
00:05:35,173 --> 00:05:37,403
Announce Erlich
as Dahl's successor.

81
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:40,889
- Not yet.
- Do it today, everybody calms down.

82
00:05:41,093 --> 00:05:43,891
I'm not sure it's Erlich.

83
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,527
It's the Fed chairman.
Give me a day.

84
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:49,122
- It'll be expensive.
- How expensive?

85
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,723
You say 300 points.
It could be more.

86
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:56,728
- Wall Street needs to trust me.
- Should I tell them that?

87
00:05:56,933 --> 00:06:00,482
I'll tell you what else.
You could've been nicer.

88
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,412
- How?
- By saying Wall Street trusts me...

89
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,128
...and the market will hold
until I appoint a chairman.

90
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,212
Just give me a minute to call
my broker and dump my portfolio.

91
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,643
I'm taking the day.

92
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:17,129
I'm gonna leak it's Erlich.
It'll calm things down.

93
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,722
- No.
- Mr. President--

94
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,243
I'm not ready to jump into bed
with Ron Erlich yet.

95
00:06:23,453 --> 00:06:27,571
Making me one of the few people
in my family who can say that.

96
00:06:28,293 --> 00:06:30,329
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,692
- That was page 17.
- Yes, sir. The leader of the....

98
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,966
- I'm reading this book.
- I'm on the phone.

99
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:55,688
You're on hold. The light's blinking.

100
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,566
- What book?
- About life 100 years ago.

101
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:03,563
The fact that I'm on hold isn't a cue
to tell me about life 100 years ago.

102
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:08,688
100 years ago, women washed their hair
once a month with borax or egg yolks.

103
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,168
Florence was in the top 10 names.

104
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:14,769
- In five minutes.
- Now it's not in the top 10,000.

105
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:18,682
- Excuse me. What?
- It isn't in the top 10,000 names--

106
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:23,171
- I'm actually back on the phone now.
- I'll wait.

107
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:26,731
Toby's gonna be fine.
Don't worry about it.

108
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:31,161
- Toby's in his office?
- The population of Las Vegas was 22.

109
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:35,645
- I'm going. But keep talking.
- Here.

110
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:37,923
- Thank you.
- You know what else?

111
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:43,048
- Drive-by shootings were a problem.
- What were they driving? Horses.

112
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:47,531
Young boys on horseback, riding
through town shooting stagecoaches.

113
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,770
- When do you read?
- It's important to make time.

114
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,248
- And you do it here.
- I'm adaptable.

115
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,409
Among other things.

116
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:03,011
C.J. needs a reason for waiting that
doesn't say we're reconsidering.

117
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,050
- I just gave her one.
- What?

118
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:07,130
Respect.

119
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,364
The man just died.
Out of respect for his memory....

120
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:15,043
- It would be wrong to name--
- Respect works.

121
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:19,767
- I'm going to the gym today.
- That doesn't interest me.

122
00:08:20,013 --> 00:08:22,925
Bernie Dahl has a heart attack
out of nowhere?

123
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:27,524
- It's his fifth. He's 138.
- I haven't been to the gym in weeks.

124
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:30,327
How much healthier do you wanna be?

125
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,127
If anybody needs me,
I'll be at the gym.

126
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:37,884
- I'm gonna live longer than you.
- Don't count on it.

127
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,931
We are waiting a day
out of respect.

128
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:45,886
- For whom?
- The dead. And how I wish I were.

129
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:48,971
- You'll love this meeting.
- Bet you I'm not.

130
00:08:49,173 --> 00:08:51,050
- It's locked down.
- I know.

131
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:53,130
With 15 votes to spare!

132
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,370
There's value to having
these congressmen.

133
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:59,041
- What is it?
- A public demonstration...

134
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:02,529
...that the liberal base
hasn't turned their backs.

135
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,849
In the case of these three...

136
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,966
...I'd like a public demonstration
that they've turned and run.

137
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,165
- You think it's beneath you to ask.
- It is!

138
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:15,530
It's sewn up by 15!
We've got the trade bill.

139
00:09:15,773 --> 00:09:20,927
It's bipartisan. We're the victors.
I'm not going in, hat in my hand.

140
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:25,849
No one's asking you to.
We're gonna do good cop, bad cop.

141
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:28,283
- No, we're really not.
- Why not?

142
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:33,283
This isn't <i>Hawaii Five-O.</i>
I'll be the cop that doesn't go.

143
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:37,964
You have to go. If you're not there,
they'll start out insulted.

144
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:41,961
- If I go, they'll end up insulted.
- Let's go.

145
00:09:42,173 --> 00:09:45,961
I need to get to exercise more.
Exercise more, eat better.

146
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:49,131
You're gonna sit
in that room and behave.

147
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,166
You'll sit there
while I court their votes...

148
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:55,570
...and you are going to smile
to indicate warmth.

149
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:58,207
I can still kick the crap out of you.

150
00:09:58,413 --> 00:10:01,246
Then what are we waiting for?
I'll be nice.

151
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:03,648
- The president's serious.
- Shouldn't be.

152
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:08,244
So you've said, but they're here
so I guess he disagrees with you.

153
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:10,683
I understand. Let's go.

154
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:19,848
You're going to sit there. If you
open your mouth, say something nice.

155
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:23,526
It's sewn up. By 15 votes.

156
00:10:23,893 --> 00:10:28,683
Good morning. How are you?
Nice to see you. Thanks for coming.

157
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:31,043
He is saddened by the death.

158
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:35,769
For 11 years, Dahl oversaw
the largest economic expansion ever...

159
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:38,328
...and I assure you he will be--

160
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:41,565
- Missed.
- Is Ron Erlich the new Fed chair?

161
00:10:41,813 --> 00:10:44,122
- The candidates--
- Who's on the short list?

162
00:10:44,373 --> 00:10:46,841
I want to be clear. No list exists.

163
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,762
As number two man at the Reserve,
Erlich is a candidate.

164
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:52,691
- Sydney Bloom?
- A candidate.

165
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,963
- Lawrence Ottenberg?
- A candidate.

166
00:10:55,173 --> 00:10:58,449
Mrs. Bartlet's declared
a preference for Erlich.

167
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:02,532
Will that weigh in
on the president's decision?

168
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:06,206
- I'm not aware of that.
- It's a wire piece.

169
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:11,971
People say she'd hoped he'd appoint
Erlich when Dahl's term expired.

170
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:18,372
I don't know who the people are, but
it's possible, on a social occasion--

171
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:20,643
When will a chairman be named?

172
00:11:20,853 --> 00:11:24,323
- We're hoping by tomorrow.
- Why the delay?

173
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,125
Respect.

174
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:31,169
- Get me the report.
- On your desk.

175
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:35,127
- Did I sound stupid saying respect?
- You were fine.

176
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:40,647
I need you. I got a question about
Mrs. Bartlet's preference for Erlich.

177
00:11:40,853 --> 00:11:44,129
- Publicly?
- It's in a wire piece on my desk.

178
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,529
- Back to your office?
- Yeah.

179
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:52,372
She was fantastic.
That's just the opening salvo.

180
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:55,292
She'll lead the charge
against child labor.

181
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:59,122
There are index cards on Patty's desk.
I need them.

182
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:03,121
Yeah, she'll do <i>Larry King,</i>
then go to St. Louis.

183
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:06,086
Call me later
and I'll give you 10 minutes.

184
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,682
- Did you see the interview?
- I didn't.

185
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:13,330
Jeffrey raised enough for Panshin
and his village to get out of debt.

186
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:16,127
- Solves that.
- Abbey's running with it.

187
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,723
- I want to be sure we call the plays.
- What's wrong?

188
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,568
C.J. was asked about the first lady's
preference for Erlich.

189
00:12:23,773 --> 00:12:26,446
- It's well-known.
- It was in a wire piece.

190
00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:31,562
- "Sources close to Mrs. Bartlet."
- I don't know anything about it.

191
00:12:31,973 --> 00:12:35,090
- It wasn't you?
- I don't know anything about it.

192
00:12:35,293 --> 00:12:38,126
We'll tell you
when we want something leaked.

193
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:43,970
I'm telling you I don't know. If C.J.
wants to come and call me a liar--

194
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:47,927
C.J. didn't come. I did.
No one's calling you a liar.

195
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:52,129
We need our two staffs
to work together better.

196
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:55,166
We need your staff
to work better with ours.

197
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:59,332
That's the spirit, Sam.
I'm late for a speech.

198
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:09,492
That was a nice bit of diplomacy
I just did. It was good.

199
00:13:10,213 --> 00:13:13,205
- I'm going to the gym now.
- Okay.

200
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:24,686
<i>Without regard to past arguments--</i>

201
00:13:24,893 --> 00:13:28,886
The national debt was so high
we sucked up to the bond market.

202
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,527
That condition doesn't exist anymore.

203
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:37,205
Historically, prosperity has been
built on growth and a GDP of 5%.

204
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:41,452
With the deflationary pressures
of the global economy...

205
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:45,043
...growth can be achieved
without rampant inflation.

206
00:13:45,253 --> 00:13:48,290
- Do you understand?
- C.J. doesn't understand.

207
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,324
I understand the <i>oeuvre.</i>

208
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:54,890
I get the basic <i>mise en scene</i>
of what you're saying.

209
00:13:55,973 --> 00:13:59,807
- I don't understand.
- Ron Erlich might not be the guy.

210
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,526
It's not a mortal lock.

211
00:14:01,773 --> 00:14:07,052
I suggest I talk to the first lady
and ask her to clarify her position:

212
00:14:07,253 --> 00:14:10,086
"My husband will choose the best man."

213
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:15,765
C.J., we don't handle my wife.
When we try, do you know what happens?

214
00:14:16,013 --> 00:14:18,527
- You get a little punishment.
- Screw it.

215
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:21,201
Let's move on.
It's not a big deal.

216
00:14:21,413 --> 00:14:26,168
But find out who those friends of
my wife's are in the wire piece...

217
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:29,689
...and have them shot.
Can I do that? Leo says I can.

218
00:14:29,893 --> 00:14:31,531
Phyllis doesn't like me.

219
00:14:31,773 --> 00:14:35,766
Susan thinks I'm xenophobic
because I don't like Mexican food.

220
00:14:35,973 --> 00:14:37,964
These are my wife's friends.

221
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:41,569
Could be our old neighbors
Herb and Marjorie Douglas.

222
00:14:41,773 --> 00:14:44,924
They're angry because
I ran them over with my car.

223
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:47,203
- Zoey's here.
- Thank you.

224
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,523
Anything else?

225
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:54,084
- No.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

226
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:58,571
I'll tell you what else. Historically,
2 to 2.5% GDP expansion...

227
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:02,806
...is classified as lackluster,
even anemic, economic growth.

228
00:15:03,013 --> 00:15:08,371
4.5 to 5% is needed to be considered
robust and not even spectacular.

229
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,691
- I don't know what you're saying.
- Sometimes I just make it up.

230
00:15:12,893 --> 00:15:15,327
Hello, sweetheart.

231
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:19,446
- You used to go to school in overalls.
- I used to be 5.

232
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:22,002
- What's up, Zoey?
- Keeping it real.

233
00:15:22,853 --> 00:15:25,083
- Who the hell knows?
- Anything else?

234
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:28,205
No. Thank you, Leo.
What you got today?

235
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,007
Intro to Cinema
and 19th Century Studies.

236
00:15:31,213 --> 00:15:34,250
- What about math?
- I graduated high school.

237
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:38,002
Wiseass all you want,
but this is the 21st century...

238
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:41,842
...in which mathematics is going
to play a starring role.

239
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:45,602
I would definitely put my shoulder
into Intro to Cinema.

240
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:47,730
It got me where I am today.

241
00:15:47,973 --> 00:15:52,285
- Did you call me to make fun of me?
- That's a big part of my day.

242
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,291
I met with Butterfield
and some agents.

243
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,723
- What did I do?
- Nothing.

244
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,003
They think you should take math.

245
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:03,888
It's time to tell you about
some letters we've been getting.

246
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,287
Threats?

247
00:16:05,493 --> 00:16:11,170
Yeah. They don't like the president's
daughter dating a black man.

248
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:13,447
Charlie?

249
00:16:13,653 --> 00:16:16,690
- You're not dating more than one guy?
- No.

250
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:21,330
Okay. One guy for you is one more
than I'm comfortable with.

251
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,730
- So you've said.
- I see it's had an impact on you.

252
00:16:24,933 --> 00:16:29,404
- How bad are the letters?
- No worse than anything else they get.

253
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,525
- These are from white supremacists?
- Yeah.

254
00:16:32,733 --> 00:16:35,645
Why did Butterfield
and the guys meet with me?

255
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:39,528
There's a national convention
of some sort in Virginia.

256
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:44,409
It was in the papers that you're
going to a club opening this weekend.

257
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,969
- You want me to cancel?
- You don't have to cancel.

258
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:50,932
But you can't bring Charlie.

259
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,967
- Okay.
- You want me to tell him?

260
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:59,892
- We're meeting later. I'll tell him.
- Tell him the truth.

261
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:03,244
- Don't make something up.
- He won't like it.

262
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:06,331
You sure you don't
want me to tell him?

263
00:17:07,013 --> 00:17:09,846
- Yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:14,527
- The assistant secretary of Treasury.
- You gotta go.

265
00:17:15,253 --> 00:17:19,724
Sorry about Bernie Dahl.
Is Ron Erlich gonna be the new chair?

266
00:17:19,933 --> 00:17:25,132
You want the job? Can't have it.
Know why? No math. Goodbye.

267
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,848
We're Democrats.
Since when do we like lower taxes?

268
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,683
We don't. We like lower tariffs
on Indian textiles, German cars...

269
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:43,530
...and Chilean wines negotiated with
130 countries over the past 7 years.

270
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:47,851
The Global Free Trade Markets
Access Act is on its third president.

271
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:50,442
We're proud it's ready to be voted on.

272
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:55,044
Where it will win by some 15 votes.
Anyone eating that doughnut?

273
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:59,485
All yours. What happens
when you lower the cost of something?

274
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:05,802
Economists will say you get a more
efficient allocation of resources.

275
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:10,524
That's nothing to me. To an economist,
that's a week in St. Barts.

276
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:13,048
Don't talk to us like we're 12.

277
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:17,087
We're concerned with the effect
the flow of cheaper goods...

278
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:20,729
...into the country will have
on American labor.

279
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,811
We're concerned about
environmental controls.

280
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:28,803
- Concerns which are reasonable.
- You're concerned with American labor?

281
00:18:29,053 --> 00:18:30,964
- What do you drive?
- Toyota.

282
00:18:31,173 --> 00:18:33,323
- Then shut up.
- Excuse me.

283
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:37,890
What Toby meant to say is
that we don't see you often...

284
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:40,402
...and it's a crying shame.

285
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:46,651
Sit tight. We're just getting started.
Think about lunch.

286
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,363
Think about the fact that
we're courting your vote...

287
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:53,525
- ...for reasons passing understanding.
- Get out here.

288
00:18:56,133 --> 00:19:01,810
This is why you have a reputation as
a pain in the ass. Can you try harder?

289
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:05,642
- Sure, because I'm not trying at all.
- I'm standing here.

290
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,846
The wire has a piece.
Sources close to the first lady--

291
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:12,726
- Who are the sources?
- Lilli doesn't know.

292
00:19:12,933 --> 00:19:14,412
- Is it Lilli?
- Yeah.

293
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:18,572
Mrs. Bartlet should make a statement.
She supports whatever--

294
00:19:18,773 --> 00:19:23,369
- She won't unless someone tells her.
- That sounds like your job.

295
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:26,969
The president doesn't want me
to handle her.

296
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:32,805
Did he say that, or did he say,
"Handle her, but I didn't say that"?

297
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,129
- I don't know.
- Gotta learn the signs.

298
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,324
- I've got most of them.
- Not that one.

299
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:40,923
Where's Sam?
I want him to talk to Lilli again.

300
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,522
What if the president meant it?

301
00:19:44,093 --> 00:19:47,927
We're not handling Mrs. Bartlet.
We're talking to her staff.

302
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:50,727
- I know most of the signs.
- Go.

303
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:56,763
- What if he drove an American car?
- Humiliate him some other way.

304
00:19:57,013 --> 00:20:01,052
- You like winning, don't you?
- Saves you from saying please.

305
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:04,086
- Let's go.
- Absolutely.

306
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:19,723
- You all right?
- Congresswoman. Yes, I'm fine.

307
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:23,608
- I heard the "ow." Figured it was you.
- Getting healthy.

308
00:20:23,813 --> 00:20:25,883
- How's your head?
- I'm fine.

309
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:30,245
- I came over for a different reason.
- How can I help you?

310
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:34,923
Can I talk to you over there
for a second?

311
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:43,284
- Congresswoman.
- Becky's fine.

312
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,042
- Where are you on the trade bill?
- We're 15 votes up.

313
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:50,848
We're meeting some friends
of yours to run up the score.

314
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:56,764
I'm talking to you as a courtesy.
There's no obligation to come to you.

315
00:20:56,973 --> 00:21:01,251
This is not an invitation for you
to try to talk me out of it.

316
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:04,172
- You're not offering an amendment.
- I am.

317
00:21:04,373 --> 00:21:09,128
Child labor restrictions. The
first lady blew the trumpet on TV.

318
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,042
With my record, I can't be left out.
This is a courtesy.

319
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,882
- We fast-tracked it to avoid--
- This is a courtesy!

320
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,693
This will blow the vote
out of the water.

321
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:24,085
I'm talking to you as a courtesy.
I'm introducing it tonight.

322
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:27,046
Josh and Toby are gonna
have to count again.

323
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:30,926
You should put some ice on that head.

324
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:42,361
Global Free Trade
Market Access Act. GFTMAA.

325
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:47,686
- I'll call you back.
- Walk with me. I'm on my way out.

326
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,933
The market opened 320 points down.

327
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:54,489
- We noticed.
- It's rebounding. Not very fast.

328
00:21:54,693 --> 00:22:00,165
The president needs a new Fed chair.
Half my salary's in technology stocks.

329
00:22:00,373 --> 00:22:05,128
The president was wondering
if you had a few minutes.

330
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:08,732
It'll just be you. Off the record.

331
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:13,882
There's a reception for the Michigan
Women's Caucus. He'll step out....

332
00:22:14,653 --> 00:22:16,484
- What?
- It sounds like--

333
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:20,129
Like it will be lousy with
female Democrats? Yeah.

334
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,051
- Okay.
- Thanks.

335
00:22:24,453 --> 00:22:28,890
Hello. I don't have time for you.
Sam, I paged you.

336
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:33,405
I got it. Becky Reeseman came over.
I need Josh and Toby.

337
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,524
- I need you first.
- What is it?

338
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:39,931
I told the president about it.
He didn't want the first lady handled.

339
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:42,368
- Did he mean it?
- I don't know.

340
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:45,889
- Gotta pick up the signs.
- I have most of them.

341
00:22:46,093 --> 00:22:49,130
- It's important.
- If you talk to Lilli again....

342
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:52,365
- Clarification.
- Nudge her in that direction.

343
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:54,922
- Where are Josh and Toby?
- Meeting.

344
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,324
- Gotta learn the signs.
- I know.

345
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:03,928
Can you deny the fact that you can
buy a British-made Range Rover...

346
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,323
...has hurt Ford to a degree?

347
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,205
I can.

348
00:23:08,413 --> 00:23:11,883
I can deny it. Range Rover
inspired the Explorer...

349
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:16,723
...a bestseller
and Ford's biggest success in years.

350
00:23:16,973 --> 00:23:19,168
Will you excuse us for a moment?

351
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:23,571
- Are we keeping you from something?
- Many, many things.

352
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:28,489
If you've had an attitude improvement,
it's marginal.

353
00:23:28,693 --> 00:23:31,332
- We're in hour 4 now.
- Guys.

354
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:35,287
- I thought you were at the gym.
- Becky Reeseman came over.

355
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:38,087
She made it clear
it was just a courtesy.

356
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,853
She's attaching
a child labor amendment.

357
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:42,611
- To what?
- To this.

358
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:43,768
- When?
- Tonight.

359
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:48,205
- This is why we fast-tracked it.
- She's on Ways and Means.

360
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:52,362
- This wasn't a joke?
- She was inspired by the first lady.

361
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:55,804
- She thought there were trumpets--
- Trumpets?

362
00:23:56,013 --> 00:24:00,052
- The trumpet call. They sounded?
- What goes on at that gym?

363
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:03,165
She thinks the train is leaving.

364
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:06,251
Mrs. Bartlet has to get Reeseman
to back off.

365
00:24:06,453 --> 00:24:09,923
- What if she's on Abbey's orders?
- I'll talk to Lilli.

366
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:14,126
I'll go. I'm going in on Erlich.
Might as well take two hits.

367
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:18,963
Impress upon her that it's taken
7 years to get the bill this far.

368
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:23,001
Add this amendment,
I gotta be nice to these people.

369
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,687
Bring this one home, Sam.

370
00:24:27,253 --> 00:24:30,131
- After you.
- After you.

371
00:24:37,013 --> 00:24:40,528
- 20 minutes and we're on campus.
- Rutledge? I read a review.

372
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:44,646
It's great. It begins, "In the summer
of 1900, my grandmother--"

373
00:24:44,853 --> 00:24:47,242
- You took notes.
- Know why?

374
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:50,365
- You're totally anal?
- No.

375
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:52,172
Yes, that's it.

376
00:24:52,373 --> 00:24:55,843
"100 years ago, the average
life expectancy was 47."

377
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:59,841
- Only 14% of homes had a bathtub.
- "8% had a telephone."

378
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:02,851
More than 95% of births
took place at home.

379
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:06,011
"90% of physicians had
no college education."

380
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,888
This is fun.
It's a time-travel thing we're doing.

381
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,324
- You want my egg salad, don't you?
- I really do.

382
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:20,730
- You have to get back?
- I've got a few minutes.

383
00:25:21,693 --> 00:25:25,572
- I need to talk about Friday.
- I took back the suit.

384
00:25:25,773 --> 00:25:31,643
I liked it, you didn't, that's okay. I
got a powder-blue tuxedo with ruffles.

385
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,889
Listen to me.

386
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:38,531
- We can't go Friday night.
- That's okay.

387
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,125
Why not?

388
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:47,723
- You've been getting death threats.
- From?

389
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,210
Because of you?

390
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:55,770
Because of me and you, yeah.
There's some sort of meeting.

391
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:58,441
The Secret Service
doesn't think that--

392
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:04,649
We tried to secure it. Too many dark
corners, alleys, windows, a cellar.

393
00:26:04,853 --> 00:26:08,243
- We can't secure the street.
- I don't give a damn.

394
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:13,528
I don't give a damn. I bought
a new suit. In fact, I bought two now.

395
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:15,452
We can't go.

396
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,852
Hey, look.
It says here, 100 years ago...

397
00:26:25,093 --> 00:26:30,372
...a black guy couldn't go out with
a white girl for fear he'd be killed.

398
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:39,562
I have to go to the ladies' room.

399
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:42,724
Bookbag's up.

400
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:50,884
You know, if nothing else...

401
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:55,132
...if one of us is gonna be pissed,
it ought to be me.

402
00:26:55,653 --> 00:26:59,282
I'm the girl whose job is
to jump in front of the bullet.

403
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:02,610
I like it when she stays home
and watches videos.

404
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:08,809
I gotta go. Tell her I had to go.

405
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:13,127
- Tell her yourself.
- I'm back at the office.

406
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:23,127
- Is Lilli in?
- You can go on in.

407
00:27:29,453 --> 00:27:33,048
- Hello, Sam.
- Mrs. Bartlet.

408
00:27:33,733 --> 00:27:36,850
Lilli tells me we have a problem.

409
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:39,331
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:27:42,613 --> 00:27:45,571
It's the tactics, Sam.
The strategizing.

411
00:27:45,773 --> 00:27:48,412
I don't understand.
We used to be close.

412
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:51,491
Now I have a large
and energetic staff...

413
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:55,083
...whose main function
is waging war with your staff.

414
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:59,172
- Is that accurate?
- No, ma'am, I don't think it is.

415
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:02,884
- We're professional.
- I don't think you are.

416
00:28:03,093 --> 00:28:04,731
Beg your pardon?

417
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:10,166
I like Lilli Mays. She's topnotch.
It was hard for us to give her up.

418
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:14,691
But I believe that you're prone
to amateur mistakes.

419
00:28:16,133 --> 00:28:19,887
So my staff is professional,
just not me.

420
00:28:20,093 --> 00:28:24,609
You can't go on national TV
and have a kid next to you on a whim.

421
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:28,089
- You gotta vet this stuff.
- What was the problem?

422
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:33,925
It looked like you discovered child
labor because Jeffrey told you.

423
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:35,891
I don't believe that.

424
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,482
I don't believe
exercise makes me healthier.

425
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:42,811
But you went to med school.
You say so, then I go to the gym.

426
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,006
Talk to Reeseman and tell her
not to offer that amendment.

427
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:49,568
- I will.
- Excuse me?

428
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,532
I said I will.

429
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,886
Is there anything else?

430
00:28:59,493 --> 00:29:03,486
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

431
00:29:05,413 --> 00:29:06,971
Thank you, ma'am.

432
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:22,411
- How you doing, Mrs. Landingham?
- Fine.

433
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:25,764
You're glancing over
like I'll steal something.

434
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,362
I'm not used to having
the media here.

435
00:29:28,573 --> 00:29:33,363
- I'll try not to get ink on the chair.
- I was about to offer you a cookie.

436
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:35,165
- And now?
- No.

437
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:38,490
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Good evening.

438
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:42,492
- Good evening.
- Are you covering the event?

439
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:47,528
- The many women of Michigan?
- The Michigan Women's Caucus?

440
00:29:48,013 --> 00:29:50,208
No, I'm here to see the president.

441
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,210
- Really?
- Yes.

442
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,722
- So, what's up?
- Not too much.

443
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,686
- You're going to the opening?
- No. Security.

444
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,121
Is Zoey bummed?

445
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:12,370
I say it here
and millions read it tomorrow.

446
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:16,646
Thanks for the circulation boost.
I'm off the record.

447
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:21,131
- It's not gonna work.
- You and Zoey? Why?

448
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:26,453
If it's a problem for the Secret
Service I'm black, that's how it is.

449
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,445
But she shouldn't expect flowers.

450
00:30:28,653 --> 00:30:32,123
It's not that you're black.
It's that you're stupid.

451
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:35,490
- Thanks, Danny.
- You bet.

452
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:38,082
The Hardy Boys in these letters...

453
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:42,809
...may be armed, but I wouldn't
bet on their marksmanship.

454
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:46,963
Marriage proposals, death threats,
a dozen bodyguards.

455
00:30:47,173 --> 00:30:50,529
Everyone wants to get close.
Everyone wants a thing.

456
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:54,248
And I say this standing
by the Oval Office...

457
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:57,490
...life with Father
couldn't have been a picnic.

458
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,482
If it was me, just for now...

459
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:04,891
...I'd make sure I was the one guy
in her life who's hassle-free.

460
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,725
That's just me.

461
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,406
Yes, sir.

462
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:18,484
Please.

463
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:24,290
- Hey, Danny.
- Good evening, Leo.

464
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:32,489
I'd like to say I urged the president
not to have this conversation.

465
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:36,527
- I'm just sitting here.
- We'll note your lack of conviction.

466
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:39,122
Note it well, sir.

467
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:48,406
- I miss our late-night talks.
- Yes, sir.

468
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:51,332
Out there on the campaign trail.

469
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:55,492
Ames, lowa, Tulsa, Skokie,
Center City, Tallahassee...

470
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:58,332
...Albany, San Antonio,
Jasper, Wyoming.

471
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:00,330
Yes, sir.

472
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:03,206
- We got very close.
- I'm flattered, sir.

473
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:06,450
- You cover the first lady as well.
- Yes, sir.

474
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:09,247
You literally wrote the book
on my wife.

475
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:13,846
I want to emphasize
the strong personal bond we built--

476
00:32:14,053 --> 00:32:15,042
For God's sake.

477
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:18,370
Did you call me in to ask
who the sources were?

478
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:23,643
I was going to
in a proper, gentlemanly...

479
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:26,686
- Even Byzantine.
- ...way.

480
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:32,172
Save me from having
this conversation with my wife...

481
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:34,768
...or let me be armed when I do.

482
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:40,684
I'm sorry. I'd be revealing a source.
I'd be in trouble with the first lady.

483
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,930
Welcome to the club.
We had some jackets made.

484
00:32:44,453 --> 00:32:46,489
Let him go.

485
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,965
Albany, Tulsa, Wichita.

486
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,562
I'm not getting
a personal bond here.

487
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:59,449
If it makes you feel better,
I gave sage dating advice to Charlie.

488
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:03,487
You're coaching my aide on
how to score with my daughter?

489
00:33:03,693 --> 00:33:07,527
- Yes, that makes me feel better.
- Anything I can do to help.

490
00:33:07,733 --> 00:33:10,645
- Go away.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

491
00:33:10,853 --> 00:33:12,332
Thanks, Danny.

492
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:18,532
- It's interesting.
- The 100 years ago thing?

493
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:24,569
Authorities warned that seamstresses
might be aroused by the pedal rhythm.

494
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:29,563
They recommended bromide
to diminish sexual desire.

495
00:33:29,773 --> 00:33:32,970
Why would anyone diminish
a woman's sexual desire?

496
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,641
We can get out of hand.

497
00:33:35,853 --> 00:33:37,889
Here we go.

498
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,645
- Excuse me.
- Good evening.

499
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:45,925
May I have a word
with the congresswoman?

500
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:48,283
I'll find you in a minute.

501
00:33:48,813 --> 00:33:50,371
That's a beautiful suit.

502
00:33:50,573 --> 00:33:55,124
Becky, did you decide to run
for the Senate and not tell me?

503
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:59,841
Because Jed and I would be there
with anything you need.

504
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,964
- I know the amendment is a surprise--
- Your amendment is a poison pill...

505
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:08,449
...that will kill the GFTMAA
in the following way.

506
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:12,487
The Republican leaders won't let
their guys wear black hats.

507
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:17,926
They'll be released from a party-line
vote. This won't shock Democrats...

508
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,044
...as they've seen it before.

509
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:25,850
It'll pass there because it'll never
pass the Senate, and you know it.

510
00:34:26,653 --> 00:34:31,773
- It felt like the train was leaving.
- When the train leaves, you'll know.

511
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:35,124
- There's a seat open.
- The president will help.

512
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:40,566
- I've heard that before.
- This isn't Steve's boat. Don't barter.

513
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:43,924
I put this amendment back in,
I'll have problems.

514
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:47,045
- How many people know?
- You, Steve, my staff.

515
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:49,608
- The president's staff.
- You're fine.

516
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:53,965
- Am I supposed to trust his staff?
- Yes.

517
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:57,323
Are we done?

518
00:34:58,293 --> 00:34:59,487
Yes.

519
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:02,205
Thank you.

520
00:35:03,413 --> 00:35:07,167
- The rhythm of the pedals?
- That's what it says.

521
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:11,412
Marijuana, heroin, morphine
were available over the counter.

522
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:15,845
According to one pharmacist,
"Heroin clears the complexion...

523
00:35:16,053 --> 00:35:19,523
...gives buoyancy to the mind,
regulates the bowels...

524
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,327
...and is a perfect guardian
of health."

525
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,251
Now they tell me.

526
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,001
Mr. President?

527
00:35:26,213 --> 00:35:28,488
- I'm out of here.
- Stay. Chicken.

528
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:34,084
- Hello, pumpkin.
- Abbey.

529
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:37,126
- Hello, gumdrop.
- Listen--

530
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:40,928
Sam Seaborn came to see
my chief of staff today. Twice.

531
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:46,605
Your chief of staff is an attractive
woman. Maybe he was, you know--

532
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:52,092
- I told C.J. specifically.
- Then C.J. got the signal wrong.

533
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:54,325
No, she didn't.

534
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,244
What?

535
00:35:57,453 --> 00:36:01,241
She didn't get it wrong.
I wanted her to send someone.

536
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:06,011
This wire thing is a problem.
The kid on TV was a mistake.

537
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:11,207
Reeseman's amendment will bring down
a bill that was worked on for years.

538
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:15,201
- I said I just killed it.
- Fine.

539
00:36:15,693 --> 00:36:18,366
We share a bed.
Why didn't you come to me?

540
00:36:18,573 --> 00:36:20,291
I staffed it out to C.J.

541
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:22,882
- You staffed it out?
- That's right.

542
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:25,129
You don't staff me out.

543
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:30,168
Don't give C.J. signals, don't send
Sam and don't bring Concanon here.

544
00:36:30,373 --> 00:36:34,491
- Don't handle me, Jed!
- Then don't play me! Don't work me.

545
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:39,603
People think Lilli Mays planted that
you have a preference for Ron Erlich.

546
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:42,805
- It wasn't Lilli Mays.
- I know. It was you.

547
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:46,210
Sorry, but I wanted Ron
to know he had my support.

548
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,565
You put me in a spot. I name
Erlich now, which I was gonna do...

549
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:54,209
...and it looks like
I'm taking instructions from you!

550
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:57,325
- It was wrong!
- You talking about you or me?

551
00:36:57,533 --> 00:37:00,445
I'm talking about you
sending people for me.

552
00:37:00,653 --> 00:37:05,124
I'm talking about you waiting a day
to name a new Fed chair...

553
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:09,212
...because 30 years ago
I dated Erlich for six months.

554
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:14,612
I am talking about sending messages
and setting agendas on morning shows.

555
00:37:14,813 --> 00:37:17,327
We won't be these people.
I won't do it.

556
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:21,321
I'll walk up to the Hill right now
and give my resignation!

557
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,923
- The House isn't in session.
- I'll put it in session!

558
00:37:25,133 --> 00:37:26,327
Don't yell at me.

559
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:30,202
It was nine months,
and I waited a day on Skippy...

560
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:35,328
...because the Fed chair is important
and I wanted my decision to be right.

561
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:40,846
You made a decision. "I name
Erlich now, which I was gonna do...

562
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:45,490
...and it looks like I'm taking
instructions from my wife."

563
00:37:54,253 --> 00:37:56,608
So just ease up on the high ground.

564
00:37:56,813 --> 00:37:59,964
On that point,
I concede the high ground.

565
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,052
I concede I was wrong about the thing.

566
00:38:03,253 --> 00:38:04,811
- Good.
- However--

567
00:38:05,053 --> 00:38:08,762
No "however." Just be wrong.
Stand there being wrong.

568
00:38:08,973 --> 00:38:10,725
- However--
- Nine months.

569
00:38:10,933 --> 00:38:14,084
However, I'll still kick your ass
on child labor.

570
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,932
- Abbey, please.
- Jed.

571
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:21,888
If it was one of our girls in that
factory, you'd send in the Marines.

572
00:38:38,573 --> 00:38:41,849
We just had
our first Oval Office fight.

573
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,525
Talk to Zoey today?

574
00:38:55,733 --> 00:39:00,124
She went back to her dorm.
She and Charlie had a fight...

575
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:04,531
...because the Service doesn't want
them at this thing together.

576
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:09,932
Maybe she'll be so traumatized
she'll never date another boy again.

577
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:14,126
He left here a little while ago.
I'd say in about an hour...

578
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,801
...there'll be a sock
on the doorknob--

579
00:39:17,013 --> 00:39:21,165
Don't finish that sentence.
I'm a man of questionable health.

580
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:27,683
Michigan women are waiting for me.

581
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:17,930
I came to apologize.

582
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:21,927
- You left me sitting there.
- I feel bad about that.

583
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:27,082
Are there other things you feel
bad about too? Name them, please.

584
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:32,129
Off the top of my head,
I don't have a full list.

585
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:34,888
