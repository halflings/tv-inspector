1
00:00:08,153 --> 00:00:12,431
<i>Two Absolut martinis up.</i>
<i>Another Dewar's rocks.</i>

2
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,823
We're not gonna run the table.

3
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:17,945
Deep background.
I won't use your name.

4
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:20,229
And you won't get a quote.

5
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,663
- Why are we here?
- You sat down.

6
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:24,909
- Is Josh on his way out?
- No.

7
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,149
- I know he's your friend.
- He is.

8
00:00:27,353 --> 00:00:29,548
- Did Caldwell--?
- I'm not talking.

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:30,947
- Who do I call?
- No.

10
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,270
- Just tell me who to call.
- Call 1-800-BITE-ME.

11
00:00:35,193 --> 00:00:37,229
He's not going anywhere, Billy.

12
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,866
You're lying now.

13
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:41,268
Why would I lie to a journalist?

14
00:00:41,473 --> 00:00:43,987
Why do you keep looking
behind me?

15
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:46,343
Alger Hiss came in with a pumpkin.

16
00:00:46,553 --> 00:00:49,272
- That girl's eyeing me.
- Really?

17
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:52,306
I never know if they're looking
or not.

18
00:00:56,953 --> 00:00:58,511
Yeah, I think she was.

19
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:01,944
Thank you for the casual way
you did that.

20
00:01:02,233 --> 00:01:04,349
She probably didn't notice that.

21
00:01:09,993 --> 00:01:15,431
<i>Twenty-five cars jumped the tracks,</i>
<i>spilling sodium hydroxide....</i>

22
00:01:15,593 --> 00:01:19,029
17 across is just wrong.
You believe that, Ruth?

23
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,428
- You should call them.
- I will.

24
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:23,589
- Telephone.
- I'm in the shower.

25
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,670
It's Potus.

26
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:36,392
You can have a normal life.
You'd be amazed at how normal I am.

27
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:38,982
It's all about budgeting your time.

28
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:43,823
This time, this hour, this is my time.
5 a.m. to 6 a.m.

29
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:48,072
I can work out,
think about personal matters.

30
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,741
I can meet an interesting man.

31
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:52,102
- The trick--
- Beeper.

32
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:54,907
- What?
- I think your beeper's going.

33
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,872
Lyman here.
What is it?

34
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:29,110
<i>Please turn off all</i>
<i>electronic devices...</i>

35
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:33,545
<i>...stow tray tables and return your</i>
<i>seats to the upright position.</i>

36
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:36,142
<i>We will be landing shortly.</i>

37
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:39,743
- Sir, please turn off your computer.
- I'm almost done.

38
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,389
Sir, your laptop interferes
with our systems.

39
00:02:43,593 --> 00:02:47,063
You know that sounds
pretty ridiculous, right?

40
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:50,743
Mr. Ziegler, a message was
sent to the cockpit for you.

41
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:55,629
I'm not sure I've got it right:
"Potus in a bicycle accident"?

42
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,505
You got it right.

43
00:02:57,713 --> 00:02:59,943
You can't use that until we land.

44
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:03,065
We're flying in
a Lockheed Eagle Series L-10 11.

45
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:07,551
It carries a Sim-5
transponder tracking system.

46
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:11,587
But I can screw it up with something
I bought at RadioShack?

47
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:14,626
You can call when we land, sir.

48
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,347
Also, I never got my peanuts.

49
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,543
How you doing, Sam?

50
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:23,313
The water pressure in here
is impressive.

51
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:26,073
- I know.
- You could run hydraulics.

52
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,582
- You want some?
- I'm fine.

53
00:03:28,793 --> 00:03:31,512
- I'm wasted.
- And free of cataracts.

54
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,467
- I get that. That's funny.
- Thank you.

55
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:38,552
Wait, your pager went off
while you were in the shower.

56
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:40,425
I thought it was mine.

57
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,749
"Potus in a bicycle accident.
Come to the office."

58
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:48,468
I memorized it just in case
I erased it by accident.

59
00:03:48,673 --> 00:03:51,426
These things look exactly alike.

60
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:56,669
Anyway, I'm totally baked,
but it's not like I'm a drug person.

61
00:03:56,873 --> 00:04:00,548
- I just love pot.
- Laurie, I have to go.

62
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:03,392
- It's 5:30 a.m.
- This doesn't look good.

63
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:04,821
Not that good, no.

64
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,752
I like you, and I'd like to call you.

65
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,663
Stay right here, save the call.

66
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:13,188
I see the logic,
but I gotta go.

67
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:18,786
- Because Potus was in an accident?
- Yep.

68
00:04:32,553 --> 00:04:35,989
Tell your friend Potus
to learn to ride a bike.

69
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:40,072
He's my boss, not my friend.
It's not his name. It's his title.

70
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,070
Potus?

71
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:45,583
"President of the United States."
I'll call you!

72
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:06,871
- Nice morning, Mr. McGarry.
- We'll take care of that in a hurry.

73
00:05:08,713 --> 00:05:11,546
- Don't kill the messenger, Leo.
- Why not?

74
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,505
- Five minutes?
- Please.

75
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,907
- Emma.
- Morning.

76
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:16,785
Wilson.
Joe.

77
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:19,382
- Jeffrey.
- Whatever. Josh!

78
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:20,992
- Morning, Leo.
- Donna.

79
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,753
- Is he in yet?
- Yeah.

80
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,905
Can you get him?

81
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:28,024
- Josh!
- Thanks.

82
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,144
- I heard it's broken.
- Wrong.

83
00:05:30,353 --> 00:05:32,548
It's a mild sprain.
He'll be back.

84
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,904
- What caused it?
- You from State Farm?

85
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:39,423
Go! Do a job.
He was swerving to avoid a tree.

86
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,624
- And?
- He was unsuccessful.

87
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:45,303
Just don't do anything
until you talk to Justice.

88
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,545
How many Cubans are crammed
into these boats?

89
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:51,711
By and large,
they're not boats.

90
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:56,145
"Boats" conjures the image
of a boat, first of all.

91
00:05:56,353 --> 00:06:00,107
What the Cubans are on
are charitably described as rafts.

92
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:03,225
They're coming from Havana
in fruit baskets.

93
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,946
- Let's be clear.
- We are.

94
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:07,144
If it floats, it looks good to them.

95
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,708
- How many are there?
- We don't know.

96
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:12,632
- What time did they leave?
- We don't know.

97
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,551
- Know when they arrive?
- No.

98
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:18,224
On high ground in Key West
with binoculars...

99
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,344
...I'd be as informed as you.

100
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,431
- True.
- Intelligence is money well spent.

101
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:27,512
Tom sent the Coast Guard.
They won't make it to our waters!

102
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,544
The DEA could suspect drugs.

103
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,506
- Do they?
- I can make a phone call.

104
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,502
If the DEA thought
they had drugs...

105
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:39,951
...wouldn't we have to search
those rafts with guns and blankets?

106
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:42,462
You look like hell.
You know that?

107
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:46,552
- I do. Listen, did he say anything?
- Did he say anything?

108
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:49,665
The president's pissed at you
and so am I.

109
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:53,422
We gotta work with these people.
Where do you get off--?

110
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,386
- Al Caldwell's a good man.
- He wasn't there.

111
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:59,107
You take the entire
Christian right...

112
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:01,543
...and dump them
into one big pile.

113
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,221
- We need them.
- We don't need them.

114
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,708
We need Caldwell.
We want Caldwell.

115
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:09,746
We don't need John Van Dyke
or Mary Marsh.

116
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,787
And I think there shouldn't be
instant replay in football.

117
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,949
- It was stupid.
- Damn straight.

118
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,623
- I was right, though!
- Like I don't know that.

119
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:23,508
Mr. McGarry, have they done an x-ray?
Is anything broken?

120
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:28,150
A $4000 titanium touring bike that
I swore I'd never lend anyone.

121
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:32,392
- I don't understand.
- He's a klutz! The president's a geek.

122
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,665
You know how I feel about
that kind of talk.

123
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,582
- I apologize.
- Just in this room, is all I'm asking.

124
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:43,388
Call OEOB.
Set up a briefing for the VP.

125
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,061
Coordinate with Katey Simons' office.

126
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:48,229
- Get everybody?
- Yes. Margaret?

127
00:07:48,433 --> 00:07:51,152
Call the editor
of <i>The Times'</i> crossword.

128
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,151
Tell him "Khaddafi" has
one H and two D's.

129
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,503
And it isn't a 7-letter word.

130
00:07:56,713 --> 00:08:00,023
- Is this real or is this funny?
- Neither.

131
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:03,225
Can I say anything besides
"Rode into a tree"?

132
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:06,027
- He'll never do it again.
- They'll laugh.

133
00:08:06,233 --> 00:08:08,269
He rode his bicycle into a tree.

134
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:12,307
"The president,
while riding a bicycle on vacation...

135
00:08:12,513 --> 00:08:15,311
...came to a sudden arboreal stop."

136
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:17,868
Tell me about the Cubans.

137
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,223
Between 1200 and 2000 Cubans...

138
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,867
...from a village south of Havana.

139
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:24,825
- Headed where?
- Vegas.

140
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:30,983
- Miami. Their navigational equipment--
- Navigational? "That way is north."

141
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:35,425
- If one had a fast ball, we'd get them.
- That's not entirely true.

142
00:08:35,633 --> 00:08:39,182
Forget about the journey.
The voyage is not our problem.

143
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:43,784
- What's our problem?
- What to do when they hit Miami.

144
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,265
Can't send them back.

145
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:48,987
- We'll get whacked.
- Three districts.

146
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:52,071
- Those seats are gone.
- Plus, it's wrong.

147
00:08:52,273 --> 00:08:53,672
- Texas?
- Don't worry.

148
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:55,864
Keep Josh in the loop on this.

149
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:58,667
- Me? The thing is--
- Deal with it.

150
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:04,304
I'm happy to. I'm just saying,
isn't this more of a military area?

151
00:09:06,353 --> 00:09:07,832
Military?

152
00:09:08,033 --> 00:09:10,627
We're under attack by
Cubans in rowboats?

153
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,791
- I like our chances.
- How did we win an election?

154
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:18,225
- Pat Thomas wants the Guard.
- You'll create a panic situation.

155
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:23,632
I agree with Josh, C.J. and Sam.
You know that makes me crazy.

156
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,791
They're on the run.
Don't play games.

157
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:29,791
Send help,
don't send the National Guard.

158
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,632
See that INS works with Red Cross
and CDC.

159
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,063
- I got a guy in CDC.
- Talk to him.

160
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:39,181
Moving on, let's talk about Josh.

161
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:42,187
Al scares the president.
Josh knows.

162
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:45,271
- He won't fire him.
- He has no choice.

163
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:49,671
- He's not gonna fire Josh.
- He doesn't have a choice.

164
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:53,072
I had drinks with Sam Seaborn
last night.

165
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:56,982
- And the president's firing Josh?
- He needs these people.

166
00:09:57,193 --> 00:09:58,831
Folks....

167
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:01,627
- What if he--?
- He doesn't have a choice.

168
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,744
Good morning.

169
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:09,710
Dr. Randal Haymen,
chief of orthopedics at St. John's...

170
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,711
...diagnosed the president
with a sprained ankle...

171
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,144
...sustained while cycling
into a large tree.

172
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,309
Details are in the report
being distributed...

173
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:25,792
...with photos of the president
resisting help and falling down again.

174
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,463
By all means, enjoy yourselves.
Item number two.

175
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,346
C.J., has the president--?

176
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:34,703
Let's just get through this.

177
00:10:34,913 --> 00:10:36,551
Item number two....

178
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:44,262
<i>None of your business.</i>
<i>If 38 states--</i>

179
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:48,307
<i>You don't believe in any god</i>
<i>that I pray to, Mr. Lyman.</i>

180
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:53,064
<i>The god you pray to is too busy</i>
<i>being indicted for tax fraud.</i>

181
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:57,466
<i>You don't believe in any god</i>
<i>that I pray to, Mr. Lyman.</i>

182
00:10:57,673 --> 00:11:02,542
<i>The god you pray to is too busy</i>
<i>being indicted for tax fraud.</i>

183
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,228
That tie bleeds on television.

184
00:11:09,473 --> 00:11:12,783
- The tie wasn't the problem.
- I told you.

185
00:11:12,993 --> 00:11:14,506
- What's that?
- Coffee.

186
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:16,590
- I thought so.
- It's for you.

187
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:19,261
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Coffee.

188
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,703
Close the door.

189
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,904
- When did you start working here?
- The campaign.

190
00:11:29,113 --> 00:11:31,343
- How long ago?
- A year and a half.

191
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:34,187
When's the last time
you brought coffee?

192
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,543
You've never brought me coffee.

193
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:40,189
- It isn't a big deal--
- If I get fired, I get fired.

194
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,831
Do you think he's gonna do it?

195
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,706
No.

196
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:51,225
You won that election for him,
you and Leo and C.J. and Sam.

197
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:54,709
- Open the damn door.
- And him.

198
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:02,027
- Thanks for the coffee.
- You're welcome.

199
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,952
- Donna brought you coffee?
- Shut up!

200
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,349
What's up?

201
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:12,665
What'd I say yesterday?

202
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:16,024
- Don't get cute with Marsh.
- Don't get cute.

203
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,782
I said don't treat Caldwell
like a revival tent clown.

204
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:22,712
- Caldwell wasn't there.
- He was watching.

205
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:24,711
What do you want from me?

206
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:27,666
I want you to keep your job.

207
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:31,230
- How?
- I have a suggestion...

208
00:12:31,713 --> 00:12:34,989
...but it's not an indication
that I like you.

209
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,666
I understand.

210
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:42,945
For the Sunday morning radio address
on family values--

211
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,104
- That's on the schedule?
- Wait.

212
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:48,790
- It's a regular Sunday.
- When was it scheduled?

213
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:55,029
After your smug, taunting, calamitous
performance on <i>Capitol Beat</i>!

214
00:12:56,713 --> 00:13:00,626
America for Better Families,
Al Caldwell, Mary Marsh.

215
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:04,621
I invited them for coffee
to talk about--

216
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,028
- What they want to hear.
- Yes.

217
00:13:07,273 --> 00:13:09,741
Presidents are
rolling in their graves.

218
00:13:09,993 --> 00:13:12,461
- Come to the meeting and be nice.
- Why?

219
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:15,745
- It'll look good.
- Caldwell's friends are bad.

220
00:13:15,953 --> 00:13:19,468
He should say so for the common good.
Screw politics.

221
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:22,108
You don't run social policy!

222
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:24,992
I'm in charge of the message
around here!

223
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:29,266
The best thing the president can
do from a PR standpoint...

224
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,391
...is to show you the door.

225
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:40,301
Come to the meeting.
Be nice, keep your job.

226
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,663
I'll be there.

227
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:52,512
- Oh, take a look at this.
- What's that?

228
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:56,501
A kid in the newsroom
clipped that this morning.

229
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:59,227
Guess who's coming to town
to consult?

230
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:03,910
- She's leasing offices downtown.
- Who's she working for?

231
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:05,904
I'm checking it out.

232
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:18,307
That's a good picture of her.

233
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:29,461
Bruce? Bruce!

234
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:32,471
I just got back into the business...

235
00:14:32,673 --> 00:14:36,143
...but I didn't come
by way of a turnip truck.

236
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:39,390
Yank me around,
and I'm gonna get cranky.

237
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:43,381
Who's your source on 443?
Big fat byline above the fold?

238
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:47,222
It's time we play
"What Have You Done For Me Lately?"

239
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:51,824
Don't say you're gonna try.
This isn't gym class.

240
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:57,821
I said gym class.
Gym class?

241
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:05,510
Because it's important
in gym to try.

242
00:15:05,713 --> 00:15:08,102
It was a simple metaphor.

243
00:15:08,313 --> 00:15:10,952
You're misinterpreting me
and the senator.

244
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:13,024
It's bush-league reporting.

245
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,224
- You ran a red light.
- Hold on.

246
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:17,310
Hustle me, I'll make you cry.

247
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,629
- License, please.
- Just a second.

248
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:21,346
Now, please.

249
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:25,626
I'm under arrest.
I have to call you back.

250
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,866
Two percent in the third quarter.

251
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:33,588
The president's gonna check
the revenue analysis...

252
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:38,708
...and say economists are here
to make astrologers look good.

253
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:42,145
Luther, one year from today,
where's the Dow?

254
00:15:42,393 --> 00:15:43,587
Great. Up 1000.

255
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:46,222
- Fred? A year.
- Not good. Down 1000.

256
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:49,425
In a year,
one of you will look stupid.

257
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:52,431
- Can we go now?
- Go. Get out.

258
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:55,141
We have storm systems
in south Florida.

259
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:58,669
With any luck,
the Cubans will turn around.

260
00:15:58,913 --> 00:16:02,872
Think they're tuned
to the National Weather Service?

261
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,022
What is it?

262
00:16:04,193 --> 00:16:06,991
- I think we're about to get tagged.
- What?

263
00:16:07,153 --> 00:16:08,791
- Re-election.
- Not yet.

264
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:12,787
Don't let Russell push us around
on Medicare or missiles.

265
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:16,463
- You're taking him too seriously.
- His stock is up.

266
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,749
- Hollywood likes him.
- It'll wait.

267
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:22,389
You're Lloyd Russell,
prince of white suburban women...

268
00:16:22,593 --> 00:16:25,391
...middle-class black men,
the Teachers' Union.

269
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:27,225
What do you do?

270
00:16:27,433 --> 00:16:29,867
- Fund exploratory committees.
- Run by?

271
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,870
- You.
- I already got a job.

272
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:33,950
- For now.
- Then who?

273
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:38,066
Mandy, if I could get her to leave
her job at Lennox<i>/</i> Chase.

274
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:42,027
- You'd be smart.
- Think she'd be interested in his job?

275
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:43,746
- Guess what?
- She here?

276
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,386
- As of today.
- Why?

277
00:16:45,593 --> 00:16:48,061
Working for Lloyd Russell.

278
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:53,992
Margaret! Get me Senator Russell's
office on the phone!

279
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,588
Same suit you wore yesterday?

280
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:59,102
Yeah. You?

281
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:01,508
Yeah.

282
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:08,304
- I think it's him.
- It is.

283
00:17:08,513 --> 00:17:10,663
I'm going over there.

284
00:17:15,153 --> 00:17:16,745
Sorry to interrupt.

285
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,262
We're in a poli-sci group.

286
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,590
You're excellent.
Could we have your autograph?

287
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:25,512
Mandy Hampton.
She's excellent too.

288
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,910
- From the campaign.
- You guys used to be a thing?

289
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:30,062
- Jenn!
- Sorry.

290
00:17:30,313 --> 00:17:33,430
She stole money from me.
Thanks for stopping by.

291
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,186
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

292
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,105
See you.

293
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:39,952
You want to know
if Lloyd's running.

294
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:42,707
I don't care.
He's a lightweight.

295
00:17:42,873 --> 00:17:44,386
- Don't like him?
- No.

296
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:48,506
- How will he be on the budget?
- You should get to know him.

297
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:51,790
- I have enough friends.
- Not these days.

298
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:57,863
- It's not like they were on our side.
- They've waited for you to trip up.

299
00:17:58,113 --> 00:18:01,901
It's Christmas morning for Mary Marsh.

300
00:18:03,153 --> 00:18:06,111
You're a Fulbright scholar.
Don't you think...

301
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:09,026
...that you're about to be fired?

302
00:18:09,273 --> 00:18:12,310
Do what Toby's telling you to do.

303
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,264
Did you call him Lloyd?

304
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,832
- Who?
- Senator Russell.

305
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:18,187
- When?
- Just now.

306
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,391
"You want to know
if Lloyd is running."

307
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:25,029
Unusual, using his first name
to a third party.

308
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,905
- Third party?
- Get my point?

309
00:18:27,113 --> 00:18:30,185
- No.
- You're dating Lloyd Russell.

310
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:35,551
Yes.

311
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:37,152
Wow. That's great.

312
00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:40,624
- Are you gonna freak out?
- No. Isn't he gay?

313
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,551
- He's not gay.
- You sure?

314
00:18:42,753 --> 00:18:45,221
- Very sure.
- He seems effeminate.

315
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:48,067
He's very athletic.
Plenty masculine.

316
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,946
- He's a woman.
- Take me seriously.

317
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,472
I do.

318
00:18:54,873 --> 00:18:57,148
<i>The Times</i> is releasing a poll...

319
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,550
...that brings your unfavorables
up to 48%.

320
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:03,221
- I hadn't heard.
- You will in an hour.

321
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,663
- Says who?
- I'm not on your team.

322
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:09,952
First you give advice,
now I'm not on your team?

323
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:13,270
I want you at fighting weight
when we start.

324
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:24,388
- You and Lloyd Russell?
- Yeah.

325
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,351
Seventeen across.

326
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:38,592
It's wrong.
You're spelling his name wrong.

327
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:42,471
What's my name?
My name doesn't matter.

328
00:19:42,673 --> 00:19:47,383
I'm a citizen who relies on
<i>The Times'</i> crossword for stimulation.

329
00:19:47,593 --> 00:19:50,312
I've met the man twice.

330
00:19:50,513 --> 00:19:55,587
I've recommended a pre-emptive Exocet
missile strike against his air force--

331
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,512
Leo.

332
00:19:58,713 --> 00:20:01,671
- They hung up on me.
- That's hard to believe.

333
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,341
- What is it?
- I need someone for--

334
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,431
- Send Naomi. What else?
- Press leak on A3C3.

335
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:12,349
That was Hutchinson. What else?
Please don't ask me about Josh.

336
00:20:12,553 --> 00:20:14,464
- I was asking--
- I don't know.

337
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,982
You know the president
better than me.

338
00:20:17,233 --> 00:20:19,110
I've known him 40 years.

339
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:24,831
Any given day, there's no predicting
what he'll choose to care about.

340
00:20:25,073 --> 00:20:27,303
I'm sorry. I'm late.

341
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,107
The assault stats are wrong.

342
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,150
They came from your office.

343
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:38,949
- You still can't use them.
- Why can't I use them?

344
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:42,748
- The 76-year-old grandma.
- Carr and Gilmore come back.

345
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,181
Who's the grandma?

346
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:46,987
Every day, 17,000 Americans
fire a gun--

347
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,387
That is untrue.

348
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:50,549
Including a 76-year-old...

349
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,870
...who defended herself
against an intruder.

350
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:57,622
A grandmother doesn't
defend herself with an AK-47...

351
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:01,428
...unless she's defending herself
against Turkish rebels.

352
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,585
- You know my assistant, Cathy.
- Hi.

353
00:21:04,753 --> 00:21:06,152
I need you a second.

354
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:07,752
Call me tonight.

355
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:11,508
- Leo's wife called.
- She hates me. What did I do?

356
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,669
You hit on her at a party.

357
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,706
- I meant, why did she call?
- She wants--

358
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:19,905
For the last time,
I didn't know who she was!

359
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,071
- Anyway--
- Most women would be flattered.

360
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:25,628
- Leo was touched.
- What did she want?

361
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,472
Her daughter's class
is getting a tour.

362
00:21:28,673 --> 00:21:30,629
She wants you to do it.

363
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,789
- I can't.
- They wrote essays.

364
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:36,110
I don't know anything
about the White House.

365
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:41,512
- You want to tell her that?
- Let this be a national emergency.

366
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,223
<i>- Cashmere Escorts.</i>
- You paged me.

367
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,583
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- Sam Seaborn.

368
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:54,784
<i>Sorry, there's been a mistake.</i>

369
00:21:54,993 --> 00:22:00,113
- Who's this?
<i>- Cashmere Escort Service.</i>

370
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:03,032
- Okay. Page me.
- Where are you going?

371
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:06,265
Nowhere.
Page me and punch in my number.

372
00:22:13,353 --> 00:22:18,108
- You switched pagers with someone?
- A woman's about to call me.

373
00:22:30,913 --> 00:22:33,552
<i>- You paged me?</i>
- Laurie.

374
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:37,622
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- It's Sam. Sam Seaborn.

375
00:22:37,953 --> 00:22:42,151
<i>- You called me.</i>
- Actually, you called me.

376
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:47,945
That's because you have my pager
and I have yours.

377
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:50,747
<i>- Oh.</i>
- Yeah.

378
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:54,070
Can I come by and see you real quick?

379
00:22:54,593 --> 00:22:58,472
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Thanks. Good.

380
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:03,788
- Four column inches above the fold.
- You're wrong.

381
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:06,587
I don't have time to answer questions.

382
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:09,068
That won't stop you from asking.

383
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:11,503
Has the president reacted to Josh?

384
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:13,669
None that I'm aware of.

385
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:16,831
I'll give you time when I've got it.

386
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:23,031
- They picking up the scent?
- Billy is.

387
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:27,021
- Josh is coming to the coffee.
- Keep him cool.

388
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:34,430
The president's deeply religious.
I don't need to tell you.

389
00:23:34,633 --> 00:23:38,706
His work with the Baptists,
the Catholic League.

390
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:39,908
And my church.

391
00:23:40,073 --> 00:23:43,986
He also spent months
traveling around the country...

392
00:23:44,193 --> 00:23:46,229
...discouraging abortion.

393
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:48,025
Hang on. He never said--

394
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:51,589
It's not the government's
place to legislate...

395
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:55,149
...but he plays his role
as a moral leader.

396
00:23:55,353 --> 00:23:58,629
Something which cost him dearly
in the campaign.

397
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:01,261
Why does he demonize us as a group?

398
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:03,628
Your group has plenty of demons.

399
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:05,511
Every group has demons.

400
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:09,262
I know, I'm in the Democratic Party.

401
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:12,863
Everyone in the Christian Right
isn't the same.

402
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:16,782
When you stand that close
to Marsh and Van Dyke...

403
00:24:16,993 --> 00:24:19,666
...they paint you
with the same brush.

404
00:24:19,873 --> 00:24:21,909
I need them for muscle.

405
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:25,025
No, you don't,
but you're in a tough spot.

406
00:24:25,233 --> 00:24:28,509
- I'm not looking for a holy war.
- I know, Al.

407
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:32,945
We can keep this from escalating
beyond a woman being angry...

408
00:24:33,153 --> 00:24:35,508
...at getting her hair messed up.

409
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:38,511
There you go.
It wasn't a little deal.

410
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:41,068
You need to take me seriously.

411
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,992
You don't think
we take this seriously?

412
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:48,391
Yesterday, the president
ordered me to fire Josh Lyman.

413
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:51,153
I'm trying to talk him out of it.

414
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:55,631
He'll be here in 10 minutes.
Who knows if Josh still has a job?

415
00:24:55,873 --> 00:24:58,910
How much more seriously
can we take it?

416
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:02,583
- It's regrettable.
- Yes, it is.

417
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:07,867
Anyway, I'm glad Toby organized
your meeting this afternoon.

418
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:10,783
So am I.

419
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:24,671
- Can I come in?
- Sure.

420
00:25:26,993 --> 00:25:30,224
- Nice apartment.
- You saw it last night.

421
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:34,432
I really like it.
It makes very good use of space.

422
00:25:34,753 --> 00:25:36,789
The ladle on the pegboards.

423
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,030
It didn't come with the apartment.
It's mine.

424
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,793
- Right.
- Yes.

425
00:25:43,353 --> 00:25:44,991
- Can I ask--?
- Am I a hooker?

426
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:47,309
What I was going to say is this:

427
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:51,552
In addition to being a law student
and part-time bartender...

428
00:25:51,753 --> 00:25:56,668
...are you what I am certain would be
a very high-priced call girl?

429
00:25:57,993 --> 00:26:00,712
I make no judgments.
But with my job--

430
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:02,869
Yeah.

431
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,750
- Yes?
- Yes.

432
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,672
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

433
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:13,341
- I wanted you to like me.
- I do.

434
00:26:21,593 --> 00:26:22,946
I have to go.

435
00:26:29,913 --> 00:26:32,985
My pager.

436
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,705
Thanks.

437
00:26:36,913 --> 00:26:40,349
- I don't know how often you get up--
- Sam, go.

438
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:43,704
You don't know who I am.

439
00:26:43,913 --> 00:26:46,507
There are people
who'd pay to try to--

440
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:47,987
I know.

441
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:53,150
Go. It's okay.

442
00:27:08,873 --> 00:27:12,832
Reverend Caldwell,
if you would step in here.

443
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:23,551
Excuse me. We'll be a minute.
Everyone have a seat.

444
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:26,950
Everybody, nicely and quietly
take a seat.

445
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:29,707
- Put it on.
- No!

446
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:32,473
You've worn those clothes
for 31 hours.

447
00:27:32,673 --> 00:27:34,664
I'm not sprucing up for them.

448
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:39,310
All the girls think you look
really hot in this shirt.

449
00:27:39,833 --> 00:27:42,586
Bonnie? Tell Toby
he's changing his shirt.

450
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:44,385
Right.

451
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,507
- You're late.
- I'm having a weird day.

452
00:27:48,713 --> 00:27:51,785
The class is waiting
in the Roosevelt Room.

453
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:56,225
- I don't know what to say.
- Tell them about the building.

454
00:27:56,433 --> 00:27:58,230
I don't know about the building.

455
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:01,266
- Fake it.
- I can't.

456
00:28:02,713 --> 00:28:06,183
Which one's Leo's daughter?
What does she look like?

457
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:09,590
- I don't know.
- Thank you for all your help.

458
00:28:09,793 --> 00:28:12,148
Sure.

459
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:17,827
- Sorry I'm late.
- Mr. Seaborn, Mallory O'Brian.

460
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,830
These fourth-graders...

461
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:22,831
...wrote essays
on visiting the White House.

462
00:28:23,033 --> 00:28:25,752
That's great.
Why don't we get started?

463
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:30,265
I'm Sam Seaborn,
the deputy communications director.

464
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:34,432
What does that mean, exactly?
I'm a counselor to the president...

465
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:38,103
...on domestic matters,
not security related.

466
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:42,591
I work with the communications
director and press secretary...

467
00:28:42,753 --> 00:28:46,348
...to get our message out
through the media.

468
00:28:46,553 --> 00:28:50,102
While my role here is seen
as politically skewed...

469
00:28:50,313 --> 00:28:54,704
...remember, it's not the DNC,
but your taxes that pay my salary.

470
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:58,508
So I work for you,
whether you voted for us or not.

471
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:06,268
How about some history?

472
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:10,984
Sure. I graduated law school
and started at Dewey Ballantine--

473
00:29:11,153 --> 00:29:14,543
Actually, I meant a history
of the building.

474
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,192
- The White House?
- Yes.

475
00:29:16,393 --> 00:29:19,590
The White House was built
several years ago...

476
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:22,751
...mostly, if I'm not mistaken,
out of cement.

477
00:29:22,953 --> 00:29:26,628
The room we're in,
the Roosevelt Room, is famous.

478
00:29:26,873 --> 00:29:32,106
It is named after our 18th president,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

479
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:35,629
The chairs were made
from a pirate ship...

480
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,746
...captured during the--

481
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:43,027
Kids, I need to talk with Mr. Seaborn.
Sit tight for a second.

482
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:52,148
Hi.

483
00:29:52,313 --> 00:29:54,110
Are you a moron?

484
00:29:54,313 --> 00:29:57,783
- In this area, yes.
- The 18th president was Grant.

485
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:00,183
This room was named for Theodore.

486
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:04,671
- There's a painting of him in there.
- I should've figured it out.

487
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:10,664
I can speak with authority on many
things, but not about the White House.

488
00:30:10,873 --> 00:30:15,151
The deputy communications director
can't talk about the White House?

489
00:30:15,393 --> 00:30:17,543
- It's ironic.
- I don't believe it.

490
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:22,150
Can you tell me which one of those
kids is Leo McGarry's daughter?

491
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:25,862
- Why?
- If I make sure she's having fun...

492
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,428
...it might make my life easier.

493
00:30:28,913 --> 00:30:31,222
These children worked hard.

494
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,947
I don't want
to make your life easier.

495
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:38,345
Please believe me when I say
I'm a nice guy having a bad day.

496
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:44,822
<i>The Times</i> says many Americans feel
the White House is unfocused.

497
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:48,702
There's footage of the president
riding into a tree.

498
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,790
We're fishing for Cubans...

499
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:54,110
...but the governor of Florida
wants a blockade.

500
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:56,747
My friend is about to get fired.

501
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,871
And I accidentally
slept with a prostitute.

502
00:31:00,073 --> 00:31:04,305
Please tell me which one of those kids
is my boss's daughter.

503
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:07,228
That would be me.

504
00:31:08,353 --> 00:31:10,423
- You?
- Yes.

505
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:15,582
Leo's daughter's fourth-grade class.

506
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:19,229
This is bad on so many levels.

507
00:31:26,193 --> 00:31:28,502
She'll try and bait you.

508
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:32,149
- Lloyd Russell. That'll last.
- Listen to me.

509
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:35,504
- They want you to sound arrogant.
- That's easy.

510
00:31:35,713 --> 00:31:39,023
We apologize.
We're running a bit late today.

511
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,712
Good afternoon.

512
00:31:40,913 --> 00:31:43,871
- How's the president?
- Mild sprain. He's fine.

513
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:45,506
John Van Dyke.

514
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:47,510
Everybody, sit.

515
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:50,068
I'm happy you could be here today.

516
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,822
The president makes
a usual Sunday radio address.

517
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:57,503
- In a few weeks, he's--
- If I could interrupt.

518
00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:02,187
Christian and family-oriented
organizations...

519
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:05,066
...while embraced by many Americans...

520
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:09,266
...have been met with hostility
by their government.

521
00:32:09,473 --> 00:32:13,182
Yesterday morning
on a television program...

522
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:18,143
...that contempt was given a voice
and a face and a name.

523
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,504
- I'm referring to you.
- Glad you brought it up.

524
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:24,586
I'm surprised.
I counted you as a friend.

525
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:26,624
And I'm honored by that.

526
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,552
When I spoke
on the program yesterday...

527
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:33,502
...I didn't speak for the president.
That's important.

528
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:35,789
Please allow me to apologize.

529
00:32:35,993 --> 00:32:39,906
My remarks were insulting.
I went for a cheap laugh.

530
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:45,141
Anybody willing to debate ideas
deserves more than a punch line.

531
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:47,663
Mary, I apologize.

532
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,743
Good, then.

533
00:32:52,193 --> 00:32:54,104
Let's deal.

534
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:58,025
- I'm sorry?
- What do we get?

535
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:00,828
- For what?
- Insulting millions.

536
00:33:00,993 --> 00:33:04,542
- Like Josh said--
- I heard. What do we get?

537
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:07,629
- An apology.
- Sunday's address.

538
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:10,103
School prayer or pornography.
Pick.

539
00:33:10,273 --> 00:33:13,185
- School prayer or porn?
- On every corner.

540
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,549
- I know.
- Condoms in the schools.

541
00:33:15,753 --> 00:33:17,505
- What?
- Condoms in schools.

542
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:20,062
- That's a problem.
- What?

543
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:24,192
They reduce the risk
of teen pregnancy and AIDS.

544
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,587
So does abstinence.

545
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:28,711
A teenager sees a condom,
he turns to lust.

546
00:33:28,913 --> 00:33:31,108
Show him a lug wrench, and he--

547
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:35,704
School prayer, pornography, condoms.
What's it gonna be?

548
00:33:38,153 --> 00:33:40,986
We're not prepared to make a deal
right now.

549
00:33:41,193 --> 00:33:42,592
Sure we are. Mary--

550
00:33:42,793 --> 00:33:46,263
You're cleaning out your desk
at the end of the day.

551
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:49,863
I'll negotiate with Toby,
if it's all the same.

552
00:33:50,073 --> 00:33:54,385
It was only a matter of time.
That New York sense of humor--

553
00:33:55,273 --> 00:33:57,264
They think they're smarter.

554
00:33:57,473 --> 00:33:59,304
But nobody else does.

555
00:33:59,513 --> 00:34:02,903
I'm actually from Connecticut.
But the point is--

556
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:04,911
She meant Jewish.

557
00:34:09,193 --> 00:34:11,787
"New York sense of humor."

558
00:34:11,993 --> 00:34:16,430
- She meant you and me.
- Let's not even go there.

559
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:21,423
There's been an apology.
Let's move on.

560
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:27,029
I want to know why we hear so much
about amendments...

561
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,985
...but not the Commandments.

562
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,862
- I don't like what I'm accused of.
- That's tough.

563
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,541
First Commandment is,
"Honor thy father."

564
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:40,104
No, it isn't. If we're going through
this preposterous exercise...

565
00:34:40,313 --> 00:34:43,305
...we're gonna get
the Commandments right!

566
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:45,424
It's the third commandment.

567
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:48,631
- And the first?
- "I am the Lord your God.

568
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:52,149
Thou shalt worship
no other god before me."

569
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,752
Those were the days.

570
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,228
- Good afternoon, Mr. President.
- Al.

571
00:34:56,433 --> 00:35:00,870
- What do you got here, C.J.?
- We've got some hot tempers.

572
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:04,230
- I'm John Van Dyke.
- Yes. Reverend?

573
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,310
May I ask you a question?

574
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:10,552
If children can buy pornography
anywhere for $5...

575
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:14,826
...isn't that too high a price
to pay for free speech?

576
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,104
- Really?
- However...

577
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:20,828
...I do think $5 is too high a price
for pornography.

578
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:23,344
- Why don't we sit down?
- No.

579
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:27,785
They won't be staying long.
Some coffee, Mr. Lewis?

580
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:31,868
I've asked you to denounce the
practices of a group...

581
00:35:32,073 --> 00:35:34,348
...called the "Lambs of God."

582
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:38,262
- It's not up to me.
- Crap. It is up to you.

583
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:42,148
My wife never wants me
to do anything while I'm upset.

584
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:43,786
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

585
00:35:43,993 --> 00:35:47,588
Years ago,
I came home from a very bad day.

586
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:49,550
I say I'm going for a drive.

587
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:53,746
I get in the car, put it in reverse,
and pull out full speed.

588
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:57,263
But I forgot to open the garage door.

589
00:35:59,353 --> 00:36:02,425
Abbey said not to drive angry.
She was right.

590
00:36:02,633 --> 00:36:07,912
She said not to get on that bicycle
while I was upset, but I did.

591
00:36:08,113 --> 00:36:10,946
I was about as angry
as I've ever been.

592
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:15,465
Seems my granddaughter had given
an interview in a teen magazine.

593
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:18,705
Between movie stars and makeup...

594
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:21,945
...she talked about
a woman's right to choose.

595
00:36:22,153 --> 00:36:25,668
Annie, all of 12,
has always been precocious.

596
00:36:25,913 --> 00:36:28,381
She's got a good head
on her shoulders.

597
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:33,747
Her mother called me in tears.
I said, "Elizabeth, what's wrong?"

598
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:35,784
She said, "It's Annie."

599
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:42,305
I love my family, I've read my Bible
cover to cover, so you tell me:

600
00:36:42,553 --> 00:36:47,786
From what part of Scripture did the
Lambs of God draw their inspiration...

601
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:51,343
...when they sent
my granddaughter a doll...

602
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:54,630
...with a knife
stuck through its throat?

603
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:01,667
You'll denounce
these people publicly.

604
00:37:01,873 --> 00:37:06,549
Until you do, you can all get
your fat asses out of my White House.

605
00:37:06,793 --> 00:37:08,670
Show these people out.

606
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:13,392
- I believe we can find the door.
- Find it now.

607
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:27,143
- We'll fix this, Leo.
- See that you do.

608
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:32,861
- I was the calmest person in the room.
- Way to stay cool.

609
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:36,031
I won't auction off
the Bill of Rights.

610
00:37:36,193 --> 00:37:37,342
You almost hit her.

611
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:41,307
- She called us New York Jews.
- I'm from Connecticut.

612
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,350
You, C.J., were brilliant.

613
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,750
I liked the part
where you said nothing at all.

614
00:37:46,953 --> 00:37:50,628
All I could think about was
Russell and your girlfriend.

615
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,745
- Mandy and Lloyd Russell?
- "Hello, Mr. President!

616
00:37:53,993 --> 00:37:58,464
Did you have a nice trip, sir?
How's the ankle, sir?"

617
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:04,066
We've been taking a little break,
thinking about our personal lives...

618
00:38:04,313 --> 00:38:06,952
...or thinking about keeping our jobs.

619
00:38:07,193 --> 00:38:11,744
It's not a bad idea to take a break
every now and then.

620
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:15,150
I know how hard you all work.

621
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:21,032
One time Annie came to me
with this press clipping.

622
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:24,430
Some theologians in South America
were excited...

623
00:38:24,633 --> 00:38:28,069
...because a little girl in Chile
sliced a tomato...

624
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:32,909
...and the inside flesh had actually
formed a perfect rosary.

625
00:38:33,073 --> 00:38:36,827
The theologians thought this was
a very impressive girl.

626
00:38:37,393 --> 00:38:41,671
Annie commented that she thought
it was a very impressive tomato.

627
00:38:42,313 --> 00:38:44,702
Don't know why I thought of that.

628
00:38:44,873 --> 00:38:49,663
Intelligence reports
1200 Cubans left Havana this morning.

629
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,945
Approximately 700 turned back
due to weather.

630
00:38:53,193 --> 00:38:56,185
Some 350 are missing
and presumed dead.

631
00:38:56,353 --> 00:39:02,792
137 have been taken into custody
in Miami and are seeking asylum.

632
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:06,429
They came through a storm.

633
00:39:06,593 --> 00:39:12,145
The ones that didn't die want a better
life, and they want it here.

634
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:15,107
Talk about impressive.

635
00:39:15,593 --> 00:39:18,710
My point is this:
Break's over.

636
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:23,223
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

637
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:35,661
"Too busy being indicted
for tax fraud"?

638
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,472
Don't ever do it again.

639
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:42,584
Yes, sir.

640
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:51,470
Mrs. Landingham, what's next?

641
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:55,628
Thomas and the majority leader
would like a conference.

642
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:58,301
A group's assembling for a photo op.

643
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:01,107
At 7:00, you have cocktails....

644
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:03,142
