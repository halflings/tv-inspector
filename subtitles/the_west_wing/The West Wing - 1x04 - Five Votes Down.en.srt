2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:11,742
A quote will disappear. A fight
with the vice president's got juice.

3
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:16,544
- I've had it up to here with you!
- Don't do what you're doing, John.

4
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:18,829
- A picture.
- Picture of us...

5
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:22,423
- ...and someone's drawn over my face.
- That was me.

6
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,629
His mother was a cop.
- Was?

7
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,983
She was killed five months ago.

8
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,791
She's recommending you.

9
00:00:28,993 --> 00:00:31,587
- If I can ask--
- Aide to the president.

10
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:33,789
What do you say?
Want to help?

11
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:35,466
Yes, sir, I do.

12
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:48,872
One night he set the
briefcase down and he said, "Bess...

13
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:53,942
...why do you suppose it is only sons
of bitches know how to lick a stamp?"

14
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:02,387
The point is friends...

15
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:06,262
...you've got to write a letter,
you've got to send a fax...

16
00:01:06,473 --> 00:01:10,591
...You've got to pick up a phone and call Western Union,
you've got to contact your congressional representatives...

17
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:14,786
- ...say, "I've got a friend...."
- McGarry here.

18
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:18,030
"I've got a neighbor
whose friend is dead...

19
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,269
...whose kids are dead."

20
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:23,625
- What are you talking about?
"I want to know."

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,551
How did it happen?

22
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,630
How did the wheels
come off this thing?

23
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:31,307
You gotta ask them!
You gotta ask them!

24
00:01:33,713 --> 00:01:36,068
- We lost five votes.
- What?

25
00:01:36,273 --> 00:01:38,229
- We lost five.
- Give me names.

26
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:42,187
- I don't got them. Get on the phone.
- Oh, man.

27
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,990
<i>I had a civil procedure professor</i>
<i>who said....</i>

28
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,548
Take a beat. There you go.

29
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:59,911
"When law is on your side, argue law,
and when facts are, argue--"

30
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,472
It's not in cement.

31
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,067
<i>"--you don't have the law or facts...</i>

32
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,430
<i>...bang on the table</i>
<i>as loud as you can!"</i>

33
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:11,024
Well, we've got the law
on our side now!

34
00:02:11,233 --> 00:02:13,747
And we've got facts
on our side now!

35
00:02:13,953 --> 00:02:17,707
This is Josh Lyman.
Call me. I need to know what happened.

36
00:02:17,913 --> 00:02:20,666
<i>We're not listening!</i>
<i>We're not having it!</i>

37

<i>We're going to win on Wednesday!</i>

38
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:27,422
<i>Thank you all. God bless you,</i>
<i>and God bless America!</i>

39
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:47,344
- Fantastic!
- Thank you.

40
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:51,985
- Good job. You didn't like it.
- It was fine.

41
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:54,303
- Better than "fine."
- It was good.

42
00:02:54,473 --> 00:02:57,431
- It was outstanding!
- He blew the "D" section.

43
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,743
- They're cheering.
- It was fine.

44
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,784
- Sam. Nice going.
- Thank you.

45
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:03,108
- Tell him.
- Why?

46
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:06,345
Sam wrote two paragraphs
and I wrote 37 pages.

47
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,542
Still!

48
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:09,789
- He blew "D."
- It was inspired.

49
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,269
- Why do you say that?
- So your face turns color.

50
00:03:13,433 --> 00:03:14,422
C.J.?

51
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:18,148
- Your fan club was out tonight.
- They like my tux.

52
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,548
- Do I have a large neck?
- What?

53
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:22,391
- Because one of--
- Stop!

54
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,948
- What?
- Look calm while I tell you.

55
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:26,944
- Tell me what?
- We lost five.

56
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:30,065
- What?
- 802. Five votes jumped the fence.

57
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:33,470
- Are you kidding me? Are you kidding?
- Nice job looking calm.

58
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:36,631
Last count, we're five votes down.

59
00:03:36,793 --> 00:03:38,590
- What happened?
- Don't know.

60
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:41,825
- Give me names.
- We're finding out.

61
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:43,022
- Hi there.
- Hi.

62
00:03:43,193 --> 00:03:46,742
- "Happy days are here again"?
- The president likes it.

63
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:50,223
- We avoid him making those decisions.
- I made it.

64
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:53,789
Right. You might rethink
marrying the lines:

65
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:56,831
"Kids are dead,"
"Happy days are here again."

66
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:58,830
- It's optimistic.
- I'll say.

67
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,426
Thank you. Good night.

68
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:02,265
- Toby? What'd you think?
- Sir?

69
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:06,182
- I thought my work was outstanding.
- I thought you would.

70
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:10,022
Thanks for asking.
You improvised in the "D" section.

71
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:12,224
- You noticed that?
- Yes, I did.

72
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:15,106
- I did a little polish up there.
- Indeed.

73
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:17,065
In front of everybody.

74
00:04:17,273 --> 00:04:21,949
I looked over once. I expected
to see you coming at me with a fork.

75
00:04:22,153 --> 00:04:26,226
- But for agents holding me--
- Thank God for the Secret Service.

76
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,823
Hey there! She deserves
a nice room and supper!

77
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:32,507
- You like doing that, don't you?
- Yeah.

78
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,146
- Charlie?
- Yes?

79
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:35,786
- What'd you think?
- Me?

80
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,022
- Yes, you.
- l--

81
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,748
He means the text,
discounting the "D" section.

82
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:44,349
I mean the entire speech,
in particular the delivery.

83
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,509
- It was excellent.
- See?

84
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:51,184
Charlie's trying to say
that the singer outdistanced the song.

85
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,146
What I heard
was the text was user-proof...

86
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:57,504
...though you tried
to disprove it in "D."

87
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:01,422
Know what? You're what
my mother calls a pain in the ass.

88
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,312
That's what my mother
calls it too, sir.

89
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,425
- Mr. President.
- Did the first lady call?

90
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,308
She wished you luck
and said to take your back medicine.

91
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:13,788
- My back's fine! I get goofy!
- I have it here, sir.

92
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:15,705
She was adamant.
Her tone--

93
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:18,706
No need to describe her tone.
We're married.

94
00:05:18,913 --> 00:05:21,381
- I don't want--
- Give me the medicine.

95
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:23,066
Thank you. I'll see you
in the morning.

96
00:05:23,313 --> 00:05:25,190
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you all.

97
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,907
We love you, Josh!

98
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:31,549
- Thanks.
- It helps not to know him.

99
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:33,789
Good to go! Move it out!

100
00:06:20,153 --> 00:06:23,111
Your food's getting cold.
Want me to bring it?

101
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,548
I've never had dumplings this good.

102
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,028
- Is mine cold?
- We ate yours.

103
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,303
- You have to try this.
- Try this.

104
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,424
- Here it comes.
- Mm. Oh, Sam.

105
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:34,669
Try the General Cho's chicken.

106
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,785
- And the Kung Pao. With the sauce.
- With the sauce.

107
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,585
- That's delicious.
- You didn't try it with the sauce.

108
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:42,307
Will the two of you shut up?

109
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:45,949
Want to try spicy beef?
I'm happy with my food.

110
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:48,462
- Botrell?
- No, it's not Botrell.

111
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:51,870
I've only got two,
but Botrell isn't one of them.

112
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,945
- Katzenmoyer and Wick.
- I'd have called that.

113
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,945
Slide me a soda, please.

114
00:06:57,113 --> 00:06:59,832
Everyone's someplace else.
I got O'Bannon.

115
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:02,109
- That's three.
- Who'd you get?

116
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:05,549
- Katzenmoyer and Chris Wick.
- Chris Wick?

117
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:08,944
- It's a mistake. Who told you?
- The minority whip.

118
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:11,343
No way Wick jumps the fence.

119
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:15,307
The president just told
anyone who reads a paper...

120
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:19,984
...we're gonna pass 802 on Wednesday.
So we've got a 72-hour fight.

121
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:22,582
- Without noise.
- We care about noise?

122
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,671
Two things you never let people
see you make:

123
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:27,670
- Laws and sausages.
- Got it.

124
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,064
- Don't involve the president.
- Right. This is us.

125
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:33,588
What's the press talking about?

126
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,704
- Financial disclosure.
- Again?

127
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,222
- Again.
- What are you worth?

128
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,231
I own this tuxedo,
and I've got 23 bucks.

129
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,867
- That's good.
- Disclosure, it is.

130
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:46,832
- No, I mean, that's good.
- She's right.

131
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:50,349
Feed them human interest,
not "disclosing assets."

132
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,705
People will like reading
that you don't have any money.

133
00:07:54,913 --> 00:07:59,668
- It's humiliating, isn't it?
- They'll love you for being broke.

134
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,189
Women can't get enough
of my 1993 Dodge Dart.

135
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,264
How do we get the votes?

136
00:08:05,513 --> 00:08:10,348
Set aside Wick, someone's wrong.
Katzenmoyer and O'Bannon, I buy.

137
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:15,030
I guess the others are Tillinghouse,
LeBrandt. We'll hear tomorrow.

138
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:17,946
They'll vote together,
so we only need one.

139
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,946
Either one, and it should be
Tillinghouse, we need help.

140
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:22,268
Yeah.

141
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,981
- Who? Who?
- You're not gonna like it.

142
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,622
- The vice president.
- No way.

143
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,511
- Tillinghouse and--
- No!

144
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,950
- I have to say--
- What time is it? I've got 2:00.

145
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,432
- 2:00.
Somebody pay?

146
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:37,790
I got it.
- Turn in a receipt. I'm going home.

147
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:39,625
- Beautiful work.
- Thanks!

148
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:42,944
Two and a half paragraphs,
37 pages.

149
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:07,110
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean?

150
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:11,983
The event was over at 10:30. I thought
you were coming straight home.

151
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:13,991
I'm really sorry, Jenny.

152
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:18,425
- What happened?
- We're five votes short on 802.

153
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:22,632
What can you do at 2 a.m. that you
can't during business hours?

154
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:28,028
I can do things. I wake people up.
I meet with key staff. It's a long--

155
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:29,911
Leo.

156
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,462
Come to bed.

157
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:35,308
Yeah. I'll be right up.

158
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:39,383
What's this?

159
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:45,031
It's a wristwatch.

160
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:48,590
- For me?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:51,671
- From you?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:54,148
For what?

163
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,626
Our anniversary.

164
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,743
Come to bed.

165
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,703
It's unusual, don't you think?

166
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,905
I honestly couldn't say.

167
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:22,224
- I'm saying, owning one stock issue.
- Yes.

168
00:10:23,033 --> 00:10:24,307
It's pretty unusual.

169
00:10:24,473 --> 00:10:26,748
And I'm saying, I couldn't say.

170
00:10:26,953 --> 00:10:30,263
I have no education in stocks.
I'm a speechwriter.

171
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,106
You're communications director.
You--

172
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:35,947
I can't say!
Ask the treasury secretary.

173
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,832
- Ask the Federal Reserve. I'm a novice.
- Toby.

174
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:42,065
I have never owned stock
until last year.

175
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:45,225
- What made you buy it?
- I liked the company.

176
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,350
- $5,000 worth?
- That's right.

177
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:51,950
And now the stock is worth $125,000?

178
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:59,832
Leela, I'm as surprised as anybody. I
didn't know till my accountant called.

179
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:03,952
Did you know 71% of the increase
happened after McGreggor...

180
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,991
...testified on the future
of Internet stocks?

181
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,223
Of course I didn't.
I never pay any attention to--

182
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:11,907
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

183
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:16,828
- Sam says they got all five.
- Tillinghouse? Thank you.

184
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:19,952
The counsel is--

185
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:23,629
I've got 48 hours to a crucial vote.
Is there a way--?

186
00:11:23,793 --> 00:11:27,502
You arranged for McGreggor
to testify in the first place.

187
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,030
I grew up with Ted McGreggor.
He's well-respected.

188
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:32,228
I understand.

189
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:37,103
But analysts attribute the jump
of the stocks to the testimony of...

190
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:40,071
...among others, your boyhood friend.

191
00:11:41,113 --> 00:11:44,822
Are you telling me you didn't know
what he was gonna say?

192
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:48,543
Not only didn't I know what he was
gonna say...

193
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,024
...not only didn't I care what he was
gonna say...

194
00:11:52,193 --> 00:11:56,709
...but if he had sat here
while I typed his testimony for him...

195
00:11:56,873 --> 00:12:00,229
...I wouldn't have understood
what he was gonna say!

196
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:02,463
- Toby.
- What?

197
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:05,511
- Friend to friend.
- Yeah.

198
00:12:05,673 --> 00:12:10,952
You know that conspiring to manipulate
the market in any way...

199
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,584
...is a federal crime, right?

200
00:12:14,473 --> 00:12:18,022
- Should I talk to a lawyer?
- Toby.

201
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:20,753
I'm saying you're talking to one now.

202
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,827
What's the range we're talking about?

203
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:28,223
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

204
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,668
- Why congratulations?
- I don't know.

205
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:35,304
The range? Votes are expensive.
O'Bannon's gonna want farm subsidies.

206
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,351
Katzenmoyer will want
tax exempt for Metrolink.

207
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:41,823
We're talking unions,
defense contracts.

208
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:45,110
- We need to answer the question.
- Which question?

209
00:12:45,273 --> 00:12:48,345
How we get votes
without giving away everything.

210
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,992
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

211
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:51,791
We give away nothing.

212
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:53,346
- We can't.
- Nothing.

213
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:56,664
L.B.J. never would have taken
this crap.

214
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:01,782
He'd have said, "You're voting my way
so I might remember your name."

215
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:06,708
We need to win. We take a victory
lap. That's how we get momentum.

216
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:11,788
We'll be tough and give away nothing.
That's what I'm taking to Leo.

217
00:13:11,953 --> 00:13:14,467
- And Chris Wick?
- Wick? I own his ass.

218
00:13:18,153 --> 00:13:19,302
I'm being mocked.

219
00:13:19,473 --> 00:13:21,623
- Congratulations.
- What did I do?

220
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:25,422
You won for best gift
on the disclosure report.

221
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,345
- Really? What won it for me?
- Yeah.

222
00:13:27,513 --> 00:13:31,950
$1189 silk smoking jacket
from Miss Sarah Wissinger.

223
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,102
Ah, yes.

224
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:37,107
You're also the runner-up with
the $345 cigarette holder...

225
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:40,709
- ...also from Sarah Wissinger.
- Sarah was fond of me.

226
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:44,422
I imagine, with those,
you were quite the dandy.

227
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:47,187
This was fun, but we're busy...

228
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:50,504
....and you have typing,
so we'll talk later.

229
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:52,186
I'll take care of Wick.

230
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:55,106
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

231
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:58,902
- I was following you.
- I was following you. All right.

232
00:13:59,073 --> 00:14:02,031
- Don't tell anyone this happened.
- Sam.

233
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:03,751
I've got a problem.

234
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:06,188
Get Dom or Cristal. She likes both.

235
00:14:06,393 --> 00:14:09,191
- Which do you like?
- I don't drink champagne.

236
00:14:09,393 --> 00:14:11,065
Put it in a high hat.

237
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,464
- What's that?
- It's a silver bucket on a tripod.

238
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:18,672
- It should all be under silver.
- They'll know what that means?

239
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,869
- Music?
- I'll put on a record.

240
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:24,070
- You don't want a violinist?
- To play a violin?

241
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:27,031
- Is that what people get?
- It's available.

242
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:32,392
No. After it wears off, there's just
a guy with a violin in my house.

243
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:35,590
- Winston's sending the choker?
- This afternoon.

244
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,630
- It's the right size?
- We hope.

245
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,103
- She's got a great neck.
- It'll call attention to it.

246
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:43,583
- Stop!
- You spend too much money.

247
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:47,302
You can squeeze a nickel
better than anyone I know.

248
00:14:47,473 --> 00:14:51,466
Excuse me for not making
40,000 a pop on the lecture circuit.

249
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:54,511
Stop reading the disclosure reports!

250
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:56,504
They'll be in the paper
in two days.

251
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:57,549
- Leo.
- Josh.

252
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:01,143
- Do women like violinists?
- Thinking about lessons?

253
00:15:01,313 --> 00:15:05,591
- No, to listen to at the table.
- Gets weird after a minute.

254
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,903
- That's what I thought.
- Birthday?

255
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:09,751
I forgot our anniversary.

256
00:15:09,953 --> 00:15:13,787
- Then I'd bring on a string quartet.
- Call the guy.

257
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:18,345
Perhaps Mrs. McGarry would enjoy you
in a nice smoking jacket.

258
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,823
- Leave.
- Call the guy.

259
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:24,864
- I'm going to Katzenmoyer.
- What'll you give him?

260
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:27,752
A wake-up call.
I want to kick his ass.

261
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:32,225
- Want to dangle his job?
- Yeah. Let him hear the branch creak.

262
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,227
- It doesn't work, we can't try again.
- Then I back off.

263
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:40,022
Then Katzenmoyer and O'Bannon
order off the menu.

264
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:44,864
If it does work, we get the other
votes, no problem, when it gets out.

265
00:15:48,553 --> 00:15:51,465
I should sell tickets to this meeting.

266
00:15:55,153 --> 00:15:58,429
You've got to understand
my district, Josh.

267
00:15:58,593 --> 00:16:02,063
Your constituents like the TEC-9,
do they?

268
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,986
They go quail hunting with an Uzi?

269
00:16:05,153 --> 00:16:07,621
I won with 52% of the vote.

270
00:16:07,793 --> 00:16:11,752
Soon as I'm sworn in, I need
$10,000 a week for reelection.

271
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:16,350
- You're not doing so well.
- I'm averaging $6,500. I squeak by.

272
00:16:16,513 --> 00:16:20,108
If the NRA makes me a target,
I lose, plain and simple.

273
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:22,582
Ask me in two years, I'll be there.

274
00:16:22,753 --> 00:16:26,826
55,000 more people will be killed
with guns in two years...

275
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:30,781
- ...but that's beside the point.
- What is your point?

276
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:34,662
Forgive my bluntness,
and with all due respect...

277
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:39,065
...but vote yes, or you won't be
on the ballot in two years.

278
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,189
- How?
- You'll lose the primary.

279
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:43,742
- There's no one else.
- Sure, there is.

280
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,187
Who?

281
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:47,821
Whomever we pick.

282
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:51,187
You're bluffing.

283
00:16:53,193 --> 00:16:54,945
Okay.

284
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:57,065
I'm in your own party!

285
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,747
It's not doing us much good, is it?

286
00:16:59,913 --> 00:17:03,064
You'd go to the press
and endorse a challenger?

287
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:05,383
No. We're gonna do it in person.

288
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:09,592
You won with 52%, but the president
won your district with 59.

289
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:11,903
I think it's time we say thanks.

290
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,588
Know how much noise Air Force
One makes when it lands?

291
00:17:15,753 --> 00:17:18,142
We'll have a party.
It will be great.

292
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:22,704
When the melon's done, in the
town square-- You got a band gazebo?

293
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:25,228
- Josh--
- We'll build one. In this gazebo...

294
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:29,386
...the president will drape his arm
around an assistant D.A.

295
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,862
Have your camera to get a picture.

296
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:36,265
That's the moment you're finished
in Democratic politics.

297
00:17:36,793 --> 00:17:40,786
President Bartlet's a good man.
He's got a good heart.

298
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,592
He doesn't hold a grudge.

299
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:46,627
That's what he pays me for.

300
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:53,985
- $125,000.
- Could you stop saying that?

301
00:17:54,313 --> 00:17:56,304
Sure.

302
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:59,465
- How much trouble am I in?
- There's two kinds:

303
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,988
- Actual and P.R.
- Talk about actual.

304
00:18:02,193 --> 00:18:05,026
You're in no actual trouble.
Absolutely not.

305
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:07,024
- Good.
- Hire a lawyer anyway.

306
00:18:07,193 --> 00:18:09,423
- Why?
- You've committed a felony...

307
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:13,142
...punishable by imprisonment
and million-dollar fines.

308
00:18:13,313 --> 00:18:16,589
Let's move from actual trouble
and talk about--

309
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,112
- Perception.
- Yes.

310
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:24,269
We've done nothing wrong, yet
the perception would be embarrassing.

311
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:27,472
- And damaging to the president.
- Indeed.

312
00:18:27,713 --> 00:18:32,150
- Why are you talking like this?
- I'm reminded of a young deputy...

313
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:35,988
...who took grief because
of a woman he was friends with.

314
00:18:36,233 --> 00:18:39,350
- I backed you on that!
- That's why I'm helping.

315
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:43,711
It's like helping my older brother.
I'm your guy on this.

316
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,307
- What's your confidence level?
- None.

317
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:49,351
- Who knows?
- Anyone who saw the report.

318
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:52,312
- Everybody has it, but you--
- Excuse me?

319
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:54,987
I was going to lunch, and I'm short.

320
00:18:55,193 --> 00:19:00,142
You wouldn't happen to have
$125,000 I could borrow, would you?

321
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:08,909
- I got your back on this, buddy.
- I'm so completely screwed.

322
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:14,623
A $145 Armani cravat,
which I'm pretty sure is a necktie.

323
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:17,546
It was a gift which he gave away.

324
00:19:17,713 --> 00:19:21,467
The president would
prefer his brother-in-law not know.

325
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:27,788
C.J., I'm curious about his Manchester
farm. The value increased $750,000.

326
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,263
- Why?
- Secret Service improvements.

327
00:19:30,433 --> 00:19:32,708
- Can you go into detail?
- A helipad...

328
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:36,786
...and the ability to run a global war
from the porch.

329
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:41,390
That's all for now. Later we'll
do Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman.

330
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:45,671
I assure you, you'll want to save
column inches for this one.

331
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,905
- Thanks.
- They can't get enough of you.

332
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:52,349
I got Katzenmoyer.
And O'Bannon and LeBrandt.

333
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:55,949
- You got three!
- Wick's waiting now. I'm not worried.

334
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,748
- Worried about Tillinghouse?
- I need the vice president.

335
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:04,543
- Leo's got to lighten up on that.
- Get Wick, then we'll deal with it.

336
00:20:04,753 --> 00:20:05,742
Josh.
- Yeah?

337
00:20:05,953 --> 00:20:08,069
- Chris Wick is waiting.
- I know.

338
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:12,784
He's been here 20 minutes. You have
a meeting, then the Asia briefing.

339
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:16,343
- I know.
- This conversation was a reminder.

340
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,983
It served as a waste of time.
Keep up the good work.

341
00:20:20,193 --> 00:20:23,663
- Congressman.
- Dude.

342
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:28,391
Could you wait outside?
We want to talk about old times.

343
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:31,551
- Go ahead.
- Thanks a lot.

344
00:20:32,953 --> 00:20:35,342
Could you close the door, please?

345
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:38,073
- Is a staff supposed to impress me?
- Josh.

346
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:42,909
I told the minority whip he was crazy.
No way is Wick jumping the fence.

347
00:20:43,073 --> 00:20:45,029
Do you know how stupid I look?

348
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:48,742
- About that, dude--
- Shove it, dude. This isn't a frat.

349
00:20:48,913 --> 00:20:49,902
What the hell?

350
00:20:50,073 --> 00:20:54,863
Name the weapons banned in the bill,
and why they should be legal.

351
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:58,787
- I should have called--
- Start here. Name the weapons.

352
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,591
- Let me--
- You don't know.

353
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:01,987
- Not true.
- MAC-90?

354
00:21:02,153 --> 00:21:05,190
- Listen--
- The PCR, MFR? Any ring a bell?

355
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,581
My aides are--

356
00:21:06,793 --> 00:21:10,263
They're copycats of the AR-15
banned two years ago.

357
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:12,822
- Calm down.
- They just changed grips!

358
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:14,472
How about the PAT-Maxi?

359
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,705
- A semiautomatic-- Yes, I'm trying--
- A grenade launcher!

360
00:21:17,873 --> 00:21:21,422
I realize not everyone
shares my view of the world.

361
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:25,666
And with gun control, I accept
a lot of viewpoints as valid...

362
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,791
...but we can get together
on a grenade launcher!

363
00:21:28,993 --> 00:21:31,712
I put you in your seat!
I got you elected!

364
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,990
Now you guys think I'm on the leash.

365
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:39,431
I'm taken for granted. I have one
photo with the president.

366
00:21:39,593 --> 00:21:42,471
Me and 16 other freshmen.
That makes me weak.

367
00:21:43,393 --> 00:21:44,667
You're not serious.

368
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:48,383
I've been here over a year.
Where's the courtship?

369
00:21:48,553 --> 00:21:53,468
It isn't ego. A relationship with the
White House is currency. I need some.

370
00:21:53,633 --> 00:21:58,024
You're voting down a measure to
restrict sales of deadly weapons...

371
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:02,072
...because nobody invited you
to the cool kids' table?

372
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,827
Got your attention.

373
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:09,263
I'm so sick of Congress I could vomit.

374
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,432
What do you want?

375
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:18,827
A round of golf.

376
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,462
- He doesn't play.
- What does he play?

377
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,385
- Chess.
- Over brandy.

378
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:26,949
A couple of photographers,
and we're fine.

379
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:30,225
- He's gonna kick your ass, you know.
- Whatever.

380
00:22:30,393 --> 00:22:33,829
- I don't appreciate you--
- You're a congressman.

381
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:37,383
You have to make that real.
This time it was me.

382
00:22:37,633 --> 00:22:42,388
You do not want to have this
conversation with the guy next door.

383
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:46,348
You guys take care.

384
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:53,586
- Wow!
- Wow is right.

385
00:22:53,793 --> 00:22:57,706
- It is so beautiful.
- Excellent choice, my friend.

386
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,945
Stop looking at me like that.
You're talking about Jenny.

387
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,786
It should flatter her neck
and please you.

388
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:05,585
- Can I try it on?
- No.

389
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:06,902
Can I rub it?
- No.

390
00:23:07,073 --> 00:23:10,349
- Could we talk about me?
Think I'll stretch it?

391
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:11,992
I've got four of five.

392
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:15,230
We need the vice president
to get Tillinghouse.

393
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,388
- We agreed.
- No.

394
00:23:16,593 --> 00:23:17,389
It needs a Texan.

395
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:21,427
I'll go to Richardson.
- We've been through this with him.

396
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,431
Let's not get the caucus
more pissed off.

397
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:28,262
- I'll talk to him alone.
- Do it quietly and right now.

398
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,304
- Margaret.
- Then call me.

399
00:23:30,473 --> 00:23:33,624
- Yes, sir?
- I need to see Mark Richardson.

400
00:23:34,953 --> 00:23:38,741
You could afford to buy
one of those now if you want.

401
00:23:38,913 --> 00:23:42,667
There's no one in the world
I don't hate right now.

402
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,144
Let me guess.
Josh got them back in the boat.

403
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:52,829
You came to me because
you don't want to use Hoynes.

404
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:56,184
- We need this one, Mark.
- I'm voting no, Leo.

405
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,384
It's all we could get now.

406
00:23:58,593 --> 00:24:03,189
You didn't work hard enough. What
happened to the TEC DC-9, the TEC-22?

407
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:05,190
What about the Striker 12?

408
00:24:05,393 --> 00:24:08,590
- We had to lose them.
- You never fought for them.

409
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:11,785
We have to do this inch by inch.

410
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,588
- No, I know how you guys work.
- That is out of line.

411
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:20,184
Guns are number one to me. I've never
moved the president off that.

412
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,351
Keeping the White House strong
is number one.

413
00:24:23,513 --> 00:24:26,949
If it isn't strong,
number two doesn't matter.

414
00:24:27,153 --> 00:24:31,192
God. The bodies being wheeled
into emergency rooms are black.

415
00:24:31,393 --> 00:24:36,592
The guns aren't going to Scottsdale.
They go to Detroit and Philadelphia.

416
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:42,789
African-American men are being
eaten alive by drugs and poverty.

417
00:24:43,393 --> 00:24:48,183
I'm encouraged the White House
has discovered the drug problem.

418
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:53,023
Your insight is matched only
by the courage displayed in this bill.

419
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,268
Oh, for God's--

420
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:59,991
Not the 3-inch grip, the 2-inch,
and the 30-round clip, not the 20.

421
00:25:00,193 --> 00:25:05,790
And three days to see if you're crazy,
as if wanting it wasn't a warning.

422
00:25:05,953 --> 00:25:07,102
This is for show.

423
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:11,989
It's a waste of taxpayer money
to have it signed and photocopied...

424
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:15,190
...to say nothing of enforced.
I want the guns.

425
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:18,226
Write a law that saves lives,
I'll sign it.

426
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:21,988
In the meantime, don't tell me
how to lead black men.

427
00:25:22,193 --> 00:25:25,071
You look like an idiot.

428
00:25:28,953 --> 00:25:32,389
Someone gave you
a year's supply of fruit? Why?

429
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:35,790
- There are people who like me.
- Why?

430
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,472
It's Leo.

431
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:39,872
What happened?

432
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,386
He needs Hoynes.
We'll set up a meeting.

433
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:48,745
We're gonna set up a meeting for you
with the vice president.

434
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:50,552
Good.

435
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,188
Jenny?

436
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:39,672
I'm still here.

437
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:42,711
What's going on?

438
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:46,185
- Leo--
- What's going on?

439
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:51,421
- Sorry you went to all this trouble.
- It wasn't any trouble.

440
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:56,505
I can't do this anymore.

441
00:26:58,353 --> 00:27:01,948
This is crazy. I don't want
to live like this. I can't.

442
00:27:02,113 --> 00:27:04,229
I'm sorry about the anniversary.

443
00:27:04,393 --> 00:27:08,705
It's not the anniversary,
it's everything. It's the whole thing.

444
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:14,587
This is the most important thing
I'll ever do, Jenny.

445
00:27:14,793 --> 00:27:16,306
I have to do it well.

446
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:19,271
It's not more important
than your marriage.

447
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:23,390
It is more important
than my marriage right now.

448
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:29,509
These few years while I'm doing this,
it's more important than my marriage.

449
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:32,944
I didn't decide to do this myself.
We discussed--

450
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:37,863
- You can find the time--
- I'm five votes down, and I must win!

451
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:42,072
- I met with the staff.
- You made the time.

452
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:45,147
- I made the time tonight.
- You didn't.

453
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:50,871
Margaret phoned to confirm your
meeting with the vice president.

454
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:54,548
I was gonna slip out for 45 minutes
and be right back.

455
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:59,065
I can't. Really.

456
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:05,743
I don't suppose we could postpone
this. It's just the past few days--

457
00:28:05,913 --> 00:28:08,381
I have to go now.

458
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,743
Okay.

459
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:16,668
I'll be at the Watergate.

460
00:28:17,273 --> 00:28:18,626
Okay.

461
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,188
And I'll...

462
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,585
...talk to you later.

463
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:27,830
- You'll call me?
- Yeah.

464
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:31,389
You want me to carry that
to the cab?

465
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:33,545
It's okay.

466
00:28:37,313 --> 00:28:40,510
Call me before you go to sleep.

467
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,749
Okay.

468
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:04,190
Excuse me, sir?
Leo McGarry's here.

469
00:29:05,353 --> 00:29:07,469
Send him in.

470
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:12,626
- Good evening, Mr. Vice President.
- Come on in. Thanks, Janeane.

471
00:29:12,873 --> 00:29:15,706
- Thanks.
- Why did you need to see me?

472
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:19,792
I came in to talk to you about 802.
We lost five votes.

473
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:20,982
I know.

474
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:26,392
We got four of them back,
but I was stupid with Richardson.

475
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:30,632
Now it's Tillinghouse.
I came in to talk to you about that.

476
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,188
Are you feeling okay?

477
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:35,469
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

478
00:29:38,753 --> 00:29:44,464
Jenny and I are splitting up, it just
happened, and I'm feeling a little....

479
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:47,591
- Janeane?
- If I could have a glass of water.

480
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:51,223
Can you get me a glass
of ice water, please?

481
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:55,668
It's going to be fine.
These things happen.

482
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:57,781
Yeah.

483
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:03,065
- Do you want to talk about it at all?
- No.

484
00:30:05,153 --> 00:30:06,745
Thank you.

485
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:21,389
- Anyway....
- I'll see Tillinghouse.

486
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,987
- Yeah?
- I'll see him tomorrow morning.

487
00:30:24,193 --> 00:30:26,263
- You'll deliver him?
- It's done.

488
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:29,186
I don't need to tell you
we need this win.

489
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:30,581
I think we're home.

490
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:35,583
Thanks, John. I want you to know
the president and I appreciate it.

491
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,671
Leo, you mind if I ask you a question?

492
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,828
What?

493
00:30:41,913 --> 00:30:45,906
When was the last time
you went to a meeting?

494
00:30:46,073 --> 00:30:48,303
A.A.?

495
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:53,623
- What meeting could I possibly go to?
- Mine.

496
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:57,347
Tell me you are not
showing your face--

497
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:01,102
I have got my own meeting.
Every week.

498
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:04,908
The downstairs office
here at 11:00 p.m.

499
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,910
There are nine of us.

500
00:31:07,113 --> 00:31:12,631
Three senators, two secretaries, one
federal judge and two agency directors.

501
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:16,149
There's an agent outside.
It looks like a card game.

502
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:23,191
- Do I have enemies in that room?
- All our people.

503
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:24,826
I had no idea.

504
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:28,548
Neither will anyone else.
You should think about it.

505
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:31,989
- Now, are you driving?
- No, I've got my guy.

506
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:37,426
Good. Have a good evening.
Sorry about Jenny.

507
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:40,431
Call me after Tillinghouse.

508
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:41,986
It's in the bag.

509
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:45,342
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Leo.

510
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:01,305
- Hi there.
- How you doing?

511
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,390
Sarah Wissinger?

512
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:07,984
A smoking jacket and a cigarette
holder, both declared. I am clean.

513
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,866
- You got these July 3.
- I sense trouble--

514
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:14,105
- We didn't break up until July 9.
- There it was.

515
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:16,992
- You got presents?
- You knew I knew Sarah.

516
00:32:17,193 --> 00:32:19,184
I didn't know about presents.

517
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:23,386
They weren't saying,
"Thanks for sleeping with me."

518
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,470
Don't talk to me.

519
00:32:25,673 --> 00:32:29,109
- What's going on?
- Hoynes is meeting with Tillinghouse.

520
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:31,781
The slut gave him the jacket July 3.

521
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:36,902
I thought a by-product of not dating
would be that you wouldn't yell at me.

522
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:38,426
That was unrealistic.

523
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:41,312
Where's the president?
Haven't seen him.

524
00:32:41,473 --> 00:32:43,748
- How'd it go?
- What do you mean?

525
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:47,104
- Last night.
- Oh, great.

526
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,190
- She liked the choker?
- Yeah.

527
00:32:49,393 --> 00:32:51,065
And the violinist?

528
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:57,229
You're right. After a few minutes,
it's strange, but....

529
00:32:57,673 --> 00:33:02,701
- She ate it up, so....
- Good.

530
00:33:03,873 --> 00:33:07,388
- Where's the president?
- His back is bad. He canceled.

531
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:11,427
He'll stay in bed, make some calls.
We should move to my--

532
00:33:13,113 --> 00:33:14,751
Hey.

533
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:19,583
Mr. President.
I thought you were staying in bed.

534
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,909
No, I feel fine.

535
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:24,911
Maybe you should get
back to the residence.

536
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,785
Hm?

537
00:33:28,713 --> 00:33:32,023
I said, maybe you should
get back to the residence.

538
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:35,384
- Maybe you should lie down.
- No need. I'm fine.

539
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:39,791
- What's going on here?
- Nothing that needs your concern.

540
00:33:39,993 --> 00:33:43,190
An issue regarding
Toby and financial disclosure.

541
00:33:43,353 --> 00:33:44,706
Well, I like to...

542
00:33:45,793 --> 00:33:48,148
...roll up my sleeves...

543
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,151
...and get involved.

544
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:55,663
Mr. President, did you take
your back pills?

545
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:58,671
I'll tell you, I was in a little pain.

546
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:04,266
Which did you take, sir,
the Vicodin or the Percocet?

547
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,503
I wasn't supposed to take both?

548
00:34:06,713 --> 00:34:09,591
We're gonna have someone
take you to bed.

549
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,102
No. Sit.

550
00:34:12,313 --> 00:34:17,341
You've got a problem,
I'm here to help. You're like family.

551
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,311
You've been there for me,
been loyal...

552
00:34:21,113 --> 00:34:23,991
...honest, hardworking, good people.

553
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:27,151
And I love you,
and I don't say that enough.

554
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:29,184
Tell me the problem, Toby.

555
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:34,662
- I'm Sam, sir.
- Sam. Of course you are.

556
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,546
Sir? Sir?

557
00:34:39,153 --> 00:34:41,713
The situation basically is this:

558
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,542
I arranged for a friend to testify
on Internet stocks...

559
00:34:45,713 --> 00:34:49,786
...while, unrelated to that,
I bought a technology issue...

560
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:53,946
...which, partly due to the testimony,
shot through the roof.

561
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:01,308
Toby.

562
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,503
Toby, Toby, Toby.

563
00:35:06,753 --> 00:35:09,472
Toby's a nice name, don't you think?

564
00:35:09,673 --> 00:35:13,552
- Can we do this another time?
- No, please. I know my body.

565
00:35:13,753 --> 00:35:18,304
I mean, I know my muscles are not--
But my mind is sharp.

566
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:21,983
I can focus. I am focused.
You know that about me.

567
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:24,263
Here's what we ought to do.

568
00:35:30,233 --> 00:35:32,542
- What was I saying?
- Mrs. Landingham?

569
00:35:32,753 --> 00:35:36,063
- We need to run through some options.
Get Charlie.

570
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:38,747
- What do you mean?
- Let's start with resignation.

571
00:35:38,953 --> 00:35:42,628
- Hot damn! Now you're talking.
- I think she meant me.

572
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:46,223
Toby's not resigning.
We're making more of this--

573
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:49,584
- I've got it!
- I've got a lawyer.

574
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:52,392
Counsel's office releases a statement.

575
00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:57,030
We make it very clear there has been
no wrongdoing of any kind.

576
00:35:57,233 --> 00:36:02,944
But to avoid any impropriety, Toby
agrees to reduce his salary to $1.00.

577
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:07,152
And cash his stock,
relieving the taxpayer of the burden.

578
00:36:07,313 --> 00:36:08,871
- Done.
- Wait.

579
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:12,304
- Good, Sam.
- No, it's not. Actually, it stinks.

580
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:14,105
You're a great writer.

581
00:36:14,313 --> 00:36:16,031
- Thank you. Leo.
- Give me a hug.

582
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,582
Come on, give us a hug.
There you go.

583
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:20,226
Excuse me?
- Charlie!

584
00:36:21,273 --> 00:36:25,232
- I left you alone for two minutes.
- Charlie's a great name.

585
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,505
Thank you.
You have to go back to bed.

586
00:36:28,673 --> 00:36:30,265
I'm going, I'm going.

587
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:35,344
Before I go,
please let me just say this.

588
00:36:38,953 --> 00:36:41,672
I'm thinking about getting a dog.

589
00:36:41,873 --> 00:36:45,070
Feel better, Mr. President.

590
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:48,712
Maybe an Irish setter.
What do you think?

591
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:51,143
I think that's great, sir.

592
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:53,230
How do you feel, big guy?

593
00:36:54,233 --> 00:36:58,192
- Like I got screwed with my pants on.
- Excellent.

594
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:02,629
- This isn't a political maneuver.
- I know.

595
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:05,148
- I'm voting my conscience.
I know.

596
00:37:05,313 --> 00:37:08,385
You can't put the toothpaste
back in the tube.

597
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:13,109
240 million guns out there.
How you gonna get them back?

598
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,786
- You can't.
- Course not.

599
00:37:14,993 --> 00:37:18,986
As long as they've got a gun,
I want my wife to have a gun...

600
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:22,907
...I want my daughter to have a gun,
and I want one too.

601
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,586
Makes perfect sense.

602
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:27,785
You might want to mention
to Josh Lyman...

603
00:37:27,993 --> 00:37:32,987
...that congressmen don't appreciate
being bullied like schoolchildren.

604
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,188
Yes.

605
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:38,784
Katzenmoyer, O'Bannon, LeBrandt,
this new kid Christopher Wick...

606
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:42,542
...these are grown men
with pride and dignity.

607
00:37:42,713 --> 00:37:45,466
- They can't be manhandled.
- They're pissed?

608
00:37:45,673 --> 00:37:50,588
They're screaming bloody murder
and talking about political retribution.

609
00:37:50,793 --> 00:37:55,264
- I don't blame them.
- Reality is reality.

610
00:37:55,473 --> 00:38:00,593
Yes, which is why I'd like very much
for you to do the following.

611
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:03,785
I want you to vote yes
on the resolution.

612
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:07,187
- John?
- And you might mention this...

613
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:11,591
...to representatives Katzenmoyer,
O'Bannon, LeBrandt and Wick.

614
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:16,344
Why, John, you do seize the moment,
don't you?

615
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,872
You've got a roll call.

616
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:22,509
Tell me something,
what's in it for me?

617
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:24,908
Right now? Nothing.

618
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:29,506
Then why am I handing you
a personal political victory?

619
00:38:29,713 --> 00:38:34,343
Because I'm going to be
president one day, and you're not.

620
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:40,549
<i>The restrictions</i>
<i>include the Mini-9 and the Ruger 14.</i>

621
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:45,992
<i>Senior aides hoped this would serve</i>
<i>as a victory for the president...</i>

622
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:50,983
<i>...but the vice president's receiving</i>
<i>most of the credit.</i>

623
00:38:51,193 --> 00:38:56,221
<i>--quick to praise the vice</i>
<i>president for securing a victory--</i>

624
00:38:56,433 --> 00:39:00,790
<i>--Mark Richardson, a man</i>
<i>seldom at a loss for words...</i>

625
00:39:00,953 --> 00:39:03,592
<i>...had no comment tonight. None.</i>

626
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:09,186
<i>You have to ask, is it an intentional</i>
<i>snub of his old friend, Jed Bartlet?</i>

627
00:39:09,393 --> 00:39:11,623
- Unbelievable.
I don't believe it.

628
00:39:11,793 --> 00:39:15,672
- Loosen the ketchup, he pops the top!
- And gets the ketchup.

629
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,869
Sorry. You saw this coming.

630
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:22,183
We got what we deserved.

631
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,590
It was hubris,
and we got what we deserved.

632
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:29,263
- Good night, everyone.
Good night.

633
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:36,465
Listen, we won.

634
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:40,987
Where's the president?
He's asleep.

635
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:42,785
Wake him.
Toby.

636
00:39:42,993 --> 00:39:46,668
- Wake him now.
- Let's leave it until tomorrow, Toby.

637
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,428
Let's leave it until tomorrow.

638
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:54,706
<i>There are Democrats on the Hill</i>
<i>with noses out of joint--</i>

639
00:39:54,913 --> 00:39:59,589
Sir, Josh Lyman is here, wondering
if he could see you a moment.

640
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:02,023
Sure.

641
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:08,032
- Evening, Mr. Vice President.
- Josh, nice victory.

642
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:11,270
Talking about the bill
or my smoking jacket?

643
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,628
No, I was talking about the bill.

644
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,186
It's a crappy law.

645
00:40:15,353 --> 00:40:18,789
- No, it is. I know, I helped write it.
- You did well.

646
00:40:18,993 --> 00:40:24,625
It's equal to fighting the war against
tobacco by banning certain matchbooks.

647
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,949
These things happen slowly.

648
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:30,388
I'd say you did well, sir.

649
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,465
In fact, you may be
the only one who did.

650
00:40:33,673 --> 00:40:36,346
I just came by to say congratulations.

651
00:40:38,073 --> 00:40:39,745
Mr. Vice President?

652
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:42,262
Right, Janeane. I'm on my way.

653
00:40:45,513 --> 00:40:46,992
- Josh.
- Yes, sir?

654
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,750
Welcome to the NFL.

655
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:08,751
Something I can help you with,
Mr. McGarry?

656
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:12,069
I'm here for the card game.

657
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:17,747
Thank you.

658
