1
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,943
- What are you holding?
- Josh said you like goldfish.

3
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:16,868
The crackers, Danny.
The cheese things you eat at a party.

4
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:18,261
Got a thing tonight?

5
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:21,550
He calls, tells me what to wear.
The rest is a surprise.

6
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,988
Your night job stinks.

7
00:00:24,153 --> 00:00:25,950
- There's gonna be trouble.
- Lillienfield?

8
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:28,149
Were you into something
not acceptable?

9
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:30,190
- Pills.
- Were you in treatment?

10
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,743
Records kept by these facilities
are confidential.

11
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:35,346
He's got them.

12
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:47,102
The president will be by the tree
with the carolers off to the side.

13
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,391
- With Santa hats?
- No, Dickensian costumes.

14
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:53,187
- Maybe both. Will they clash?
- They might.

15
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,583
- Why am I here?
- To weigh in on this.

16
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:58,267
- I could care less.
- Toby!

17
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,742
- Who's playing Santa?
- Al Roker.

18
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:02,784
- Why?
- He went on a diet.

19
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:04,386
- How do you know?
- I read.

20
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:08,182
We'll pad him.
We have Jose Feliciano, Sammy Sosa--

21
00:01:08,353 --> 00:01:12,426
Did you know that "Feliz Navidad"
outsold "White Christmas"?

22
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:16,142
He speaks on the season of hope
and the new millennium.

23
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:18,423
The new millennium? Fine.

24
00:01:18,593 --> 00:01:20,549
- Don't start.
- I said, fine.

25
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:21,941
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:24,502
- It's not the new millennium.
- It is.

27
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:29,189
2000 is the last year of the
millennium, not the first of the next.

28
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,509
To quote Steven Gould--

29
00:01:31,713 --> 00:01:35,786
- He needs a calendar.
- He says this is unresolvable.

30
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:39,309
It's tough to resolve.
You'd need a calendar.

31
00:01:39,473 --> 00:01:41,384
Toby, phone call.

32
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,945
- I'll call back.
- It's the D.C. police.

33
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:51,549
- What do they want?
- They want you.

34
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:58,830
Which is better, watching your car
roll over from 99,999 to 100,000...

35
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,427
...or watching it go from 100 to 101?

36
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:05,791
- The millennium's a year away?
- Yeah, but we've made plans.

37
00:02:05,953 --> 00:02:10,265
- Would you tell them I'm on my way?
- Flamingo is on her way.

38
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:13,266
What did you--?
What did he call me?

39
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:34,906
- Excuse me. I'm Toby Ziegler.
- Where you been?

40
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:37,906
The coroner's office
told me to come here.

41
00:03:38,113 --> 00:03:40,468
Do you know this man?

42
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:44,944
- No.
- You sure?

43
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:48,862
- Yeah.
- His name's Hufnagle. Ring a bell?

44
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:54,585
He had a driver's license on him.
It expired in 1973. Hufnagle, Walter.

45
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:59,344
- Why'd you call me?
- He also had your business card.

46
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,589
Did he?

47
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:05,745
- Toby Ziegler? From the White House?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:08,421
He had your business card.

49
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:15,991
That's my coat.
I gave it to the Goodwill--

50
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:20,385
The card was in it.
Well, that explains that.

51
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,743
Well, thanks for your time.

52
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:29,349
- This isn't a crime scene, is it?
- No, sir.

53
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:33,062
I was called an hour ago.
Why's the body still here?

54
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:37,784
An ambulance will come by.
It's not a high priority.

55
00:04:37,953 --> 00:04:41,423
- Then you're gonna call the V.A.?
- V.A.?

56
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:45,632
The tattoo on his forearm,
it's Marine battalion, 2nd of the 7th.

57
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,949
This guy was in Korea.

58
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:51,832
Thanks.

59
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,745
Merry Christmas.

60
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:01,148
Merry Christmas.

61
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:19,028
- Good morning, Josh.
- Good morning.

62
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,424
Merry Christmas to you
and your Protestant family.

63
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,823
I've not yet bought you a present.

64
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:29,783
I know you're agonizing over how
to show your appreciation for me.

65
00:05:30,033 --> 00:05:31,910
That, and how I scrape
together the $10.

66
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:34,752
- I've prepared a list.
- Of gifts?

67
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:41,352
"Ski pants, ski boots, ski hat,
ski gloves." You already have skis?

68
00:05:41,513 --> 00:05:43,663
- Page two.
- Right.

69
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:47,109
Just pick something.
Feel free to pick two things.

70
00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:50,709
- I should feel that freedom?
- I want to learn to ski.

71
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:54,343
- Why?
- I like the equipment. Where you going?

72
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,350
- I need to speak to Leo.
- Why?

73
00:05:56,513 --> 00:06:00,791
- He wants to talk about your present.
- Really?

74
00:06:00,953 --> 00:06:04,946
- You'll think about the skis?
- I'll give it a lot of thought.

75
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:12,903
- Hello?
- Come on back.

76
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:17,750
- Quite an operation.
- We're spreading holiday cheer.

77
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:20,751
Who is this? Do I care
if he has a nice Christmas?

78
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:23,547
Sign the damn thing.

79
00:06:23,793 --> 00:06:26,626
- Leave us for a minute.
- We're not done.

80
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,750
Two minutes!

81
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:31,751
Sorry.

82
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:37,345
I'm tired of waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

83
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:40,710
Lillienfield's waiting
till after Christmas.

84
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:45,663
I don't want to tell you too much,
but I want to try a preemptive strike.

85
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,586
You gotta tell me more than that.

86
00:06:48,793 --> 00:06:51,307
- Sam knows a girl.
- I've heard rumors.

87
00:06:51,553 --> 00:06:55,785
I want to talk to her.
Something to keep in our pocket--

88
00:06:56,033 --> 00:07:00,788
I don't want it in anyone's pocket.
Especially the president's.

89
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,547
Lillienfield's coming, it's no joke.

90
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:06,307
You don't have to tell me,
it's my life.

91
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:09,192
All I'm saying is,
we don't do these things.

92
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,106
- All right.
- All right?

93
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,950
- You hear about the kid in Minnesota?
- No.

94
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:19,304
A gay high-school senior.
He got beaten up.

95
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:24,593
They stripped him, tied him to a tree
and threw rocks and bottles at him.

96
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,387
You know how old the assailants were?

97
00:07:27,593 --> 00:07:30,027
Thirteen.

98
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,668
- Is the kid dead?
- He's in critical condition.

99
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:39,782
We're gonna have to revisit hate
crimes legislation after the break.

100
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,553
We need to gauge reaction
before we wade in.

101
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,029
C.J.'s gonna send up
a test balloon at her briefing.

102
00:07:46,193 --> 00:07:47,672
All right.

103
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:50,111
Margaret!

104
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:53,265
- Yes, sir?
- Let's get this over with.

105
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:55,549
See you later.

106
00:07:57,633 --> 00:08:02,866
The president is scheduled to leave
for New Hampshire at 10 a.m...

107
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:05,024
...so he'll leave around noon.

108
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,630
He'll attend Christmas services
with his family in the morning.

109
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,671
Are you aware
a student was attacked--?

110
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:15,985
His name is Lowell Lydell,
he's 17 years old...

111
00:08:16,233 --> 00:08:20,909
...he's in critical condition with
a cracked skull, internal bleeding...

112
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:25,192
...and broken bones and lacerations.
We'll keep you updated.

113
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:27,867
Will this revisit
the hate crime debate?

114
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:31,469
Yes, but the best time to do that
would have been...

115
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:34,705
...before Lowell Lydell was beaten,
not after.

116
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:38,351
Walter Hufnagle.

117
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:41,390
I don't know.

118
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:43,390
I don't know!

119
00:08:43,553 --> 00:08:47,626
I've been holding on
for the better part--

120
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,351
Sure. Yeah.

121
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,388
- Are you busy?
- I'm holding.

122
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,868
What's going on?

123
00:08:55,073 --> 00:09:00,352
A homeless vet died last night. I
don't know if anyone's been contacted.

124
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:04,301
- I don't know what kind of burial--
- How do you know him?

125
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:07,590
I don't. Don't worry about it.
What do you need?

126
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,825
- This might seem trivial right now.
- What?

127
00:09:11,073 --> 00:09:15,351
The Santa hats do clash
with the Dickensian costumes.

128
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:19,263
- It might seem trivial?
- Keeping you in the loop.

129
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:23,028
- Yes, I'm here. Go away.
- Yeah, I know.

130
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,908
Josh, I need to talk to you.

131
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:32,985
I'm giving your list
the consideration--

132
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:37,829
Seriously. What's going on with Leo?

133
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,507
Donna--

134
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:44,107
I just heard something
from Margaret.

135
00:09:44,313 --> 00:09:46,668
- You shouldn't be--
- Yeah, but we did.

136
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:49,029
Is it true?

137
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,749
Yeah.

138
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,904
- Well?
- Well, what?

139
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:57,111
- What are you gonna do?
- Right now, nothing.

140
00:09:57,313 --> 00:10:00,988
We're gonna wait and see.
There's not much else I can do.

141
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:04,151
- We'll wait and see?
- Yes.

142
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:10,185
Could you stop looking at me
like I just killed your hamster?

143
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:15,348
If one of us was in trouble,
he would be the first person--

144
00:10:15,553 --> 00:10:17,748
I know!

145
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:22,550
I know.

146
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:28,387
It was my regular face.
I wasn't trying to guilt you.

147
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:30,265
I know.

148
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:34,541
I have to work.

149
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:39,751
Okay, kids, remember the drill.

150
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:43,986
You'll say your name, your grade
and you'll ask the president...

151
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:49,830
...the question you and your teacher
prepared on your index card.

152
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:58,311
Okay, how about a big "Good morning,
Mr. President" when he comes in?

153
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:02,392
Good morning, Mr. President!

154
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:05,431
That sounded weak to me.
Let's try it again.

155
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:09,382
Good morning, Mr. President!

156
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:13,990
That's better. Now, who are
all these people making a ruckus?

157
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,905
- What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

158
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,145
When are you gonna get taller?
What are you, 16?

159
00:11:19,313 --> 00:11:21,668
- I'm 7.
- Then you're fine.

160
00:11:21,873 --> 00:11:24,546
Let's go!
Come on, I'm a busy man.

161
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:27,221
I am, after all,
the president of Bulgaria.

162
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:30,271
- No!
- Wait, that's not right.

163
00:11:30,473 --> 00:11:33,465
I'm the president of Luxembourg.

164
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:36,785
- No!
- I'm the president of something.

165
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,989
America!

166
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:42,708
Yes, thank you.
I am the president of the U.S.A.

167
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,784
- Now, who has a question?
- Me!

168
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,261
Yes, ma'am?

169
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:50,466
My name is Jessica Hodges,
and I'm in the third grade.

170
00:11:50,633 --> 00:11:54,308
What's your favorite part
about being president?

171
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:58,791
My favorite part about being
president? I'm doing it right now.

172
00:11:58,953 --> 00:12:00,750
- Who's next?
- Me!

173
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:03,381
Wait, hang on a second.

174
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:07,911
Apparently there are kids in
the other room I might like better.

175
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:09,671
No!

176
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:14,309
Sorry to interrupt, but you
asked to be notified.

177
00:12:14,553 --> 00:12:18,751
Lowell Lydell died
about 15 minutes ago.

178
00:12:29,553 --> 00:12:32,545
Send flowers,
and I'll call his parents.

179
00:12:40,913 --> 00:12:43,108
All right, on with the questions.

180
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:49,587
Wait. When you address me, bear in
mind that I'm the king of England!

181
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:50,987
No!

182
00:12:51,193 --> 00:12:55,186
- What was it again?
- America!

183
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:56,951
Yes.

184
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,863
- I saw your briefing.
- What'd I do?

185
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:10,706
You hit the gas with
hate crimes legislation.

186
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:14,986
- First, I didn't. Second, why not?
- We're not sure where we stand.

187
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:19,590
I know where I stand.
They threw rocks at his head.

188
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,988
I understand. I'm just saying--

189
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:25,390
I'll keep my foot off the gas.
What's your code name?

190
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,863
They just changed it.
It's Princeton.

191
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:29,944
- Mine's Flamingo.
- It's nice.

192
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:31,592
No, it's not nice.

193
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,984
- It's a nice-looking bird.
- It's ridiculous-looking.

194
00:13:35,153 --> 00:13:37,383
- You're not.
- I know I'm not.

195
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:42,303
- Any way I can get out of this?
- I'm gonna talk to someone.

196
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,906
Sam, how you doing?

197
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,031
I'll be in Bermuda soon,
that's how I'm doing.

198
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,990
- Where's Toby?
- Out.

199
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:51,064
Sam, you got a second?

200
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:53,224
Yeah. 83 degrees in Bermuda--

201
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:57,386
Just me, some suntan oil,
and 655 pages of briefing memos.

202
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:00,943
I need to ask you something
about your friend.

203
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:03,752
- What happened?
- Nothing.

204
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:07,792
Listen, you would describe her as--
What's her name again?

205
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,984
- Laurie.
- She's expensive?

206
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,621
- I have no way of--
- I understand.

207
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:14,988
Yes. Very expensive.

208
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,223
- She's elite?
- Yes. Why?

209
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,989
I need to know
if she would divulge the names...

210
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:25,629
...of any Republican members
of Congress that she--

211
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:28,751
There's no way, Josh!

212
00:14:28,913 --> 00:14:31,029
- A thing's gonna happen.
- What?

213
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:35,584
- Lillienfield knows Leo was a drunk.
- Everyone knows that.

214
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:42,272
But they don't know there were pills.
There was Valium. He was in rehab.

215
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:44,270
- When?
- Six years ago.

216
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:47,192
He was secretary of labor
six years ago.

217
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,550
He was high when he was running
the Labor Department.

218
00:14:52,313 --> 00:14:54,065
And Lillienfield knows?

219
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:59,353
I'm fairly sure that's why he
started this. He's gone hunting.

220
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:10,352
Sam, we owe Leo everything.
I mean, everything.

221
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:17,151
I'll call her,
and we'll go see her together.

222
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:20,111
Thanks.

223
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,106
- Charlie?
- Yes, ma'am?

224
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:31,231
Remind the president
he's allergic to eggnog.

225
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:33,588
- Sure.
- Thank you.

226
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:38,270
This place looks great.
I've never seen a Christmas like this.

227
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:43,746
The trees and the lights
and everybody singing. The presents.

228
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,346
I brought it up
because you seem down.

229
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:51,151
I tend to get a little down
during the holidays.

230
00:15:51,313 --> 00:15:53,986
- You don't like Christmas?
- I miss my boys.

231
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,950
I never knew you had kids.

232
00:15:56,113 --> 00:16:00,903
Twins. Andrew and Simon.
I tried not to--

233
00:16:01,113 --> 00:16:05,470
I dressed them differently,
but they did everything together.

234
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:11,981
They went to medical school together,
and their lottery number came up.

235
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:15,270
- For the draft?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,948
Couldn't they get a deferment
to finish school?

237
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:20,944
They didn't want one.

238
00:16:21,153 --> 00:16:27,149
I begged them, but they wanted to go
where people needed doctors.

239
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:31,187
We begged them,
but you can't tell kids anything.

240
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:34,385
They joined up as medics,
and four months later...

241
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:39,786
...they were pinned down during
a fight and were killed by enemy fire.

242
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:43,747
That was Christmas Eve, 1970.

243
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:51,345
They were so young, Charlie.
They were your age.

244
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:56,231
It's hard when that happens
so far away...

245
00:16:56,393 --> 00:17:02,582
...because with the noises and the
shooting, they had to be so scared.

246
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:07,748
It's hard not to think that,
right then, they needed their mother.

247
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:15,429
Anyway, I miss my boys.

248
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:52,390
You want to sign the book?

249
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:56,148
- Excuse me?
- Sign in the book?

250
00:17:56,593 --> 00:17:58,549
Sure.

251
00:18:00,993 --> 00:18:05,703
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

252
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:09,792
No. I'm not a visitor. I was....

253
00:18:10,033 --> 00:18:12,786
I'm not the police, I was....

254
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:16,502
A homeless man died this morning
near the monument.

255
00:18:16,753 --> 00:18:19,313
When the weather gets down....

256
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,864
I thought that maybe he slept
there a lot, maybe you knew him.

257
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,991
He was one of them.
Was he a friend of yours?

258
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:30,145
- No.
- I didn't think so.

259
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:36,182
I'm just trying to contact
someone that might...

260
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:40,790
...you know,
be interested that he died.

261
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:44,184
They hang around Capitol and P,
I'd try there.

262
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:48,151
Thanks. You a veteran?

263
00:18:48,313 --> 00:18:49,792
Yeah.

264
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,191
Toby Ziegler.

265
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:53,945
John Noonan.

266
00:18:57,233 --> 00:19:01,465
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

267
00:19:04,873 --> 00:19:08,104
- A couple of guys.
- No. Leave me alone.

268
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,909
- Josh, what are you doing right now?
- Preparing for the economic summit.

269
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:16,702
Blow it off. Seriously.
Come shopping with us.

270
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:19,910
- Shopping?
- He won't take any press.

271
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:24,624
- How are you going shopping?
- I sneak out every now and then.

272
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:29,662
A few agents, an unmarked Suburban,
they clear the store, I'm in, I'm out.

273
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,551
I never knew this.

274
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,831
You know there's a tunnel out of here?
I haven't found it.

275
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:39,781
- Where are you going?
- To Rare Books. Know what they sell?

276
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:41,705
- Fishing tackle?
- Funny boy.

277
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:46,822
The president is shopping,
and he won't let me send press along.

278
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:50,110
- Tell her to leave me alone.
- A couple of guys?

279
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,822
- We don't have to make hay out of it.
- It's good hay!

280
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,109
- Wanna come?
- With you to a bookshop?

281
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:59,151
Drop me off the top of
the Washington Monument instead.

282
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:04,341
It's Christmas. No reason
we can't do both. Let's go shopping!

283
00:20:06,153 --> 00:20:10,146
Hey, C.J. I saw the Suburban.
President's slipping away?

284
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:13,470
- He realized he forgot your gift.
- How sweet.

285
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,943
I made a list of reasons
you should go out with me.

286
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:20,822
Give me time to put together
a list of why I shouldn't.

287
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:23,228
- Then we'll compare them.
- Good.

288
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:25,509
My Secret Service code name
is Flamingo.

289
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:28,352
- Nice bird.
- Go away.

290
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:35,145
Sam, what do you and Josh
have going on tonight?

291
00:20:35,353 --> 00:20:37,344
Nothing.

292
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:40,551
I just meant did you want
to come over for dinner?

293
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:41,702
Oh. Yeah.

294
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:45,752
- What did you think I meant?
- I'm going to Bermuda tonight.

295
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:48,666
- What did you think?
- That's what I thought.

296
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:52,752
Then why did you say nothing
if you're leaving?

297
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:58,147
I really don't know.
But thank you for the invitation.

298
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,193
What do you and Josh
have going on tonight?

299
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:03,344
Nothing.

300
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:15,544
<i>The Fables of Phaedrus,</i> 1886.

301
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:19,792
First edition, red leather,
gilt leathering, engraved frontis.

302
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:23,662
Phaedrus, a slave who was
later given his freedom...

303
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,745
...wrote his animal fables
in iambic verse.

304
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,104
Nothing says Christmas like
animal fables in verse.

305
00:21:30,313 --> 00:21:32,065
That's what I say.

306
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:35,748
- Photographers would have killed him?
- Let it go.

307
00:21:35,913 --> 00:21:40,828
Here's a book which, if I was stuck on
an island, I still wouldn't read it.

308
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:45,942
<i>The Adventures of James Adams,</i>
<i>Mountaineer and Hunter of California.</i>

309
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:48,946
I would eat this book
before I read it.

310
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:52,509
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- No, I appreciate it--

311
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:55,983
- You gonna be by yourself?
- I've got lots of work.

312
00:21:56,153 --> 00:21:59,111
You're gonna work on Christmas?
I feel better.

313
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:01,184
Come stay at the house.

314
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,628
So you can read aloud
from <i>Phaedrus</i>?

315
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:05,829
Now that you suggest it....

316
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:09,349
- I'll be fine.
- Suit yourself.

317
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,784
Mr. President, when you get back...

318
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:17,702
...we'll have to talk seriously
about my situation.

319
00:22:17,873 --> 00:22:22,185
I'm not worried about it. It'll
be fine. These things can go away.

320
00:22:22,393 --> 00:22:25,749
No, they can't,
and they usually don't.

321
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:31,226
I'll need an exit strategy that won't
cause turmoil during the confirmation.

322
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,703
I don't want to talk about
an exit strategy.

323
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,784
It's gonna be fine.

324
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:38,989
Mr. President, it's time.

325
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:44,426
Zoe starts Georgetown in two weeks.
I was thinking about this for her.

326
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:49,348
<i>The Nature of Things,</i> translated
from the Latin. What do you think?

327
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:54,303
- It's better than a stereo.
- Because it's got a Moroccan spine.

328
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:59,501
- You head for the car and I'll pay.
- Thank you all. Merry Christmas!

329
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:02,551
- You heard what I said before, right?
- What?

330
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:05,750
- In my office this morning?
- Yeah.

331
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:11,142
<i>- Life of Epicurus,</i> two volumes.
- Let's go.

332
00:23:33,313 --> 00:23:34,951
Excuse me.

333
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,989
Excuse me.

334
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:43,181
I was wondering if by any chance
you know a man named Walter Hufnagle.

335
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,543
- Walter?
- Yes.

336
00:23:45,713 --> 00:23:47,749
You looking for Walter?

337
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:52,543
- I wasn't looking for him, l--
- That's his brother down there.

338
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:58,222
- Thank you.
- What's the problem?

339
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,782
There's no problem.
Down on the end?

340
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,831
Yeah. Listen....

341
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:06,350
He's a little slow.

342
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:09,750
He's all right, just a little slow.

343
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:11,944
Thanks.

344
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:21,749
Excuse me.

345
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:25,942
Mr. Hufnagle?

346
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,702
I'm George.

347
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,830
- Are you Walter Hufnagle's brother?
- Yeah.

348
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:38,344
I'm afraid I have some very bad news.

349
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:41,312
Walter died last night.

350
00:24:43,353 --> 00:24:44,672
Oh, jeez.

351
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:47,381
It was a very cold night.

352
00:24:47,593 --> 00:24:51,632
Yeah, because of the northeasterly
wind off the Chesapeake.

353
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:53,704
Everything all right?

354
00:24:54,473 --> 00:24:58,512
- Walter died.
- Who are you?

355
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:01,989
I'm Toby Ziegler.

356
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:06,112
Walter was wearing my coat,
and it had my business card.

357
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,582
- You want your coat back?
- No.

358
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,666
The northeasterly wind
off the Chesapeake.

359
00:25:11,873 --> 00:25:17,027
- Did you know he fought in Korea?
- I'm sure he didn't mean nothing.

360
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:20,981
- Sometimes people start things--
- No.

361
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:25,750
He was in the Marines
about 45 years ago.

362
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:28,302
Yeah, I think I remember.

363
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:30,981
He was given a medal.

364
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:35,385
It's called the Purple Heart.
It's for getting wounded in battle.

365
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:37,828
- He was wounded?
- Yeah.

366
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:40,911
I guess he wasn't too good at it, huh?

367
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:46,306
No, no. A lot of people
were wounded or even killed.

368
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:49,502
Were you there?

369
00:25:50,273 --> 00:25:53,663
No. No, I was....

370
00:25:53,873 --> 00:25:55,704
Anyway....

371
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,670
I wasn't sure if anyone
had contacted you.

372
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:03,746
I slept over there
at the shelter last night...

373
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:07,428
...because of the northeasterly wind
off the Chesapeake.

374
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:10,505
It was pretty cold.

375
00:26:10,673 --> 00:26:14,791
And I guess there weren't
enough beds for Walter.

376
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:21,231
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:23,153 --> 00:26:25,303
Good night.

378
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,950
I'm sorry, this is
none of my business--

379
00:26:32,153 --> 00:26:38,149
Your brother is entitled to a proper
funeral. He deserves an honor guard.

380
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,190
And you don't know me.

381
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:46,667
But I'm an influential person,
I'm a very powerful person...

382
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:49,108
...and I would like to arrange it.

383
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:50,592
A funeral?

384
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:52,984
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- Yeah.

385
00:26:53,193 --> 00:26:56,947
So if I come pick you up,
then I'll bring you back after--

386
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:00,071
- I'll make sure he's here.
- Will you?

387
00:27:01,593 --> 00:27:03,504
Thank you.

388
00:27:04,513 --> 00:27:09,826
Let me just.... Here.
Please, just take that.

389
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:14,151
No, that's all your money. You don't
live around here. You need it.

390
00:27:14,313 --> 00:27:16,543
- I'm fine.
- Here. Take it.

391
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:21,105
- Really, I'm fine.
- You don't live around here.

392
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:25,302
Thank you.

393
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,384
You're a reporter.
I'm the press secretary.

394
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:39,226
It's an unavoidable
conflict of interest.

395
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:42,032
It would hurt our reputations.

396
00:27:42,273 --> 00:27:45,424
- Your editors would--
- C.J., what are you doing?

397
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:49,262
- I'm reading my list.
- You made a list?

398
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:51,105
- Didn't you?
- Sure.

399
00:27:51,313 --> 00:27:55,465
- You didn't make a list?
- It's right here. It's a mental list.

400
00:27:55,713 --> 00:27:57,988
- I made an actual list.
- I can see.

401
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:01,031
- Why are you in here?
- To give you a present.

402
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:05,311
You gave me a goldfish.
What more could I want?

403
00:28:09,913 --> 00:28:11,141
Goldfish food.

404
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:14,146
I'm gonna ignore your list.
It's ridiculous.

405
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:18,101
Also because I've got a crush on you.

406
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:20,873
- Leo's here.
- See you later.

407
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:22,711
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey, Leo.

408
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:25,262
- That's a nice goldfish.
- Isn't it?

409
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:28,709
- Happy holidays.
- You too.

410
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:32,189
- I'm rebuffing him.
- Whatever.

411
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:36,392
- Dial it down on hate crimes.
- You told me to float a test balloon.

412
00:28:36,553 --> 00:28:39,704
Float, not shove.
I'm not sure where we stand.

413
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:44,270
They made him say Hail Marys as
they beat him. It was entertainment.

414
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:48,472
This is a manifestation of racism
or sexism or homophobia...

415
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:52,546
...that are only the start of
a pathology troubling this country.

416
00:28:52,873 --> 00:28:57,708
I know. I'm just not sure it's right
to legislate against how people think.

417
00:28:57,993 --> 00:29:03,511
A lot of people aren't sure.
A lot of them work here. Dial it down.

418
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,352
Thank you.

419
00:29:07,633 --> 00:29:11,103
- You have plans yet?
- For Christmas?

420
00:29:12,113 --> 00:29:16,072
- My plan is to do nothing.
- You want me to cook you something?

421
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:20,021
- What, are you my mother?
- I was just asking.

422
00:29:21,873 --> 00:29:24,103
I'll see you later.

423
00:29:39,433 --> 00:29:41,901
This is Josh Lyman.

424
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:44,909
Come in.

425
00:29:54,153 --> 00:29:56,792
Like I said,
I only have a few minutes.

426
00:29:57,313 --> 00:30:00,703
- We'll get right to the point.
- Please.

427
00:30:03,553 --> 00:30:08,547
Here's what's going on.
A guy we work with is in some trouble.

428
00:30:08,793 --> 00:30:13,503
A congressman is about to expose
something damaging about his past.

429
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:16,062
Doing what you do, we thought--

430
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:20,465
I could name an influential
Republican who likes kinky sex...

431
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:22,942
...so you can scare Lillienfield?

432
00:30:23,193 --> 00:30:26,151
- I never said it was Lillienfield.
- Is it?

433
00:30:26,313 --> 00:30:27,507
Yes.

434
00:30:27,713 --> 00:30:31,911
This is for real?
This isn't a joke of some kind?

435
00:30:32,113 --> 00:30:34,502
It's for real.

436
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:39,821
Then get out and we'll pretend
this never happened.

437
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:41,785
Haven't we met?

438
00:30:41,953 --> 00:30:43,864
- Yes, we have.
- Where?

439
00:30:44,073 --> 00:30:47,509
White House. She came
with Carl Everett.

440
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:52,912
Who raised $5 million for Bartlet.
Think only Republicans pay for sex?

441
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:56,742
- This isn't about that.
- You get this out of a book?

442
00:30:56,993 --> 00:30:59,188
- It was my idea.
- You're the brains?

443
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:03,511
Yeah. And I could care less
about your indignation.

444
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:08,429
This is the kind of attack from which
men in my business do not recover.

445
00:31:08,593 --> 00:31:12,711
If our tactics aren't civilized,
neither are our attackers!

446
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:15,865
I'm not taking civics lessons
from a hooker!

447
00:31:16,113 --> 00:31:20,550
We don't need your cooperation.
The IRS works for me!

448
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:22,624
Just a name! You want money?

449
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:26,229
Fine, then you can leave
the money on the nightstand!

450
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:29,785
- I don't think he meant--
- Yes, he did!

451
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:36,903
No, I didn't.

452
00:31:39,313 --> 00:31:41,702
In fact, I'm sorry.

453
00:31:45,673 --> 00:31:49,905
I apologize, that was very rude.

454
00:31:55,073 --> 00:32:00,101
We wouldn't have asked,
but this person means a lot to us.

455
00:32:01,273 --> 00:32:03,707
You're the good guys.

456
00:32:05,353 --> 00:32:08,151
You should act like it.

457
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:13,712
I have to get dressed now.

458
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:26,902
We're not talking about
burning crosses. People are dying.

459
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:29,627
And people get punished for that.

460
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:32,865
You want to punish them
for what's in their mind?

461
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:35,547
- Yes.
- Really?

462
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,351
- Who is this?
- Elizabeth.

463
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:40,903
- Who's Elizabeth?
- Your sister.

464
00:32:41,073 --> 00:32:46,067
This isn't abstract theory. We can't
say we're protecting civil rights...

465
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:49,430
...we have to do it.
Plus, it's good politics.

466
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,982
- Now I'm listening.
- We'll get into it?

467
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:56,305
- We'll get into it after the break.
- Excuse me.

468
00:32:56,993 --> 00:33:00,588
- You wanted to see us?
- Oh, yes, very much.

469
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:04,905
- Should I leave?
- As quickly as possible.

470
00:33:06,873 --> 00:33:08,704
You went and did it?

471
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:11,666
- What?
- Exactly what I asked you not to do?

472
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:14,467
You saw Sam's friend.
I had you tailed.

473
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:17,471
- You had us tailed?
- Why?

474
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:20,904
On the off-chance you'd be stupid!
Whose idea was it?

475
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:22,945
It was mine.

476
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:26,225
Sam was a reluctant accomplice.
You had us tailed?

477
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,310
- Get over it.
- She didn't say anything.

478
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:32,148
- It's not what we do.
- That may be true, but still--

479
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:35,311
- It's not what we do.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:37,862
You should apologize to her.

481
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,149
- I did.
- Do it again.

482
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,705
Like I'm not gonna have enough
problems without the Keystone Kops?

483
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,192
- We meant well.
- That means something?

484
00:33:48,353 --> 00:33:49,342
No.

485
00:33:50,593 --> 00:33:52,902
It does.

486
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,628
I'm glad.

487
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,949
- Go to work.
- It's Christmas Eve.

488
00:33:59,353 --> 00:34:01,742
The country isn't open
on Christmas Eve?

489
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:04,143
Fair point.

490
00:34:07,993 --> 00:34:09,585
Leo....

491
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:12,385
I know.

492
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,625
It's gonna get bad
before it gets better.

493
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:18,749
I know.

494
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:21,145
Margaret!

495
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:26,908
- Let's get this over with.
- I'm here Christmas.

496
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:35,349
There's been no change in departure,
so we're still looking at noon.

497
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:38,750
This is a half-day for us,
so it is for you too.

498
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:42,303
There is no more news,
have a merry Christmas.

499
00:34:46,553 --> 00:34:48,908
Hey, fish boy.

500
00:34:50,313 --> 00:34:53,066
Answer this.
There's a lot riding on it.

501
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:56,703
- What's riding on it?
- A date with me.

502
00:34:56,873 --> 00:34:59,512
Is imposing penalties
for hate crimes...

503
00:34:59,713 --> 00:35:02,511
...a powerful statement
against intolerance?

504
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:06,342
- No. A crime's a crime.
- Wrong answer.

505
00:35:06,513 --> 00:35:09,710
Punishing beliefs is the end.
And you agree with me.

506
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:13,826
I don't. Take me out tonight
and convince me.

507
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,745
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

508
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:19,030
- I was distracted.
- I won't say it again.

509
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:22,305
Then I'm gonna assume
you asked me out.

510
00:35:22,993 --> 00:35:28,351
I didn't ask you out. You asked me out
49 times and I'm saying yes to one.

511
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:31,630
You understand we're having dinner,
not a fling?

512
00:35:31,793 --> 00:35:36,071
- I understand.
- It's business. Bring your notebook.

513
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:39,589
- My Secret Service name is Flamingo.
- Nice.

514
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:42,313
I have to feed my fish.

515
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:46,224
- Hey, Danny.
- Hey, Josh.

516
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:49,703
- How's it going?
- Hard to say.

517
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:57,506
<i>Heinrich Breckengruber</i>
<i>on the Art and Artistry of Skiing.</i>

518
00:35:57,673 --> 00:36:02,189
It's got a molted calf cover
and original drab boards.

519
00:36:02,873 --> 00:36:06,946
- I don't know what to say.
- I wrote a note inside.

520
00:36:15,193 --> 00:36:20,665
Don't get emotional.
Donna, don't get--

521
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:24,508
Let's try and maintain some sort of--

522
00:36:24,873 --> 00:36:26,101
You see?

523
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:30,346
You spend most of your time being,
you know, you...

524
00:36:30,513 --> 00:36:33,949
...and then you write
something like this to me.

525
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:37,108
Thank you.

526
00:36:38,353 --> 00:36:40,309
I meant it.

527
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:43,269
Skis would have killed you?

528
00:36:45,313 --> 00:36:47,304
- Yeah.
- Okay.

529
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:08,901
Hello!
Welcome to the White House!

530
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:13,304
Good morning!
Welcome to the White House!

531
00:37:15,793 --> 00:37:18,387
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mrs. Landingham.

532
00:37:18,553 --> 00:37:20,703
- The president wants you.
- I know.

533
00:37:20,873 --> 00:37:25,071
Did you use his name to arrange
a funeral for a homeless veteran?

534
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:28,145
- Yes.
- You shouldn't have done that.

535
00:37:28,353 --> 00:37:32,744
- I know.
- You absolutely shouldn't have.

536
00:37:32,953 --> 00:37:34,909
I know.

537
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,783
The president's in the Mural Room.

538
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:42,346
Thank you.

539
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:56,109
- How would it be if I just mentioned--?
- No.

540
00:37:56,273 --> 00:38:00,710
- Shopping on your own at a bookstore?
- Deal with it.

541
00:38:05,353 --> 00:38:07,389
I'll be right back.

542
00:38:10,513 --> 00:38:14,267
- Merry Christmas, Mr. President.
- Merry Christmas, Nancy.

543
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,185
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

544
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:29,584
Seems I've arranged
an honor guard for somebody.

545
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:31,272
I'm sorry.

546
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,072
Tell me, anything else
I've arranged for?

547
00:38:34,233 --> 00:38:38,385
We're still in NATO, right?
What's going on?

548
00:38:40,113 --> 00:38:42,832
A homeless veteran died last night.

549
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:47,145
He was wearing a coat I gave to
the Goodwill. It had my card in it.

550
00:38:47,313 --> 00:38:50,623
It took an hour and 20 minutes
for the ambulance.

551
00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:55,469
A lance corporal, Marine Corps.
I got better treatment at Panmunjom.

552
00:38:55,673 --> 00:39:00,189
If we pull strings like this,
every homeless veteran will show up.

553
00:39:00,353 --> 00:39:02,184
I can only hope, sir.

554
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,432
When is it?

555
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:12,463
I'm going to pick up his brother
and go there now.

556
00:39:15,073 --> 00:39:19,703
Sir, your absence in
the other room is conspicuous.

557
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:35,305
Toby.

558
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:40,507
I'd like to come along.

559
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:16,662
