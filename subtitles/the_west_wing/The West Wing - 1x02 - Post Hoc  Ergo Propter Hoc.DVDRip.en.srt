00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:07,961
MANDY:
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:11,569
Give me your number,
l'd like to call you.

3
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,644
Stay. Save yourself a call.

4
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:17,050
The president's pissed
at you and so am l.

5
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:21,849
lt's my job to tell the president
it's best to show you the door.

6
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:26,092
You won that election for him.
You, Leo, C.J. and Sam.

7
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:29,723
ls it possible you are,
what would have to be. . .

8
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,885
-. . .a very high-priced call girl?
-Yes.

9
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:37,848
Hypothetical: You're Russell,
no friend of the president.

10
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,442
-What do you do?
-Exploratory committee.

11
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:42,285
-Who do you get?
-Mandy.

12
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:45,485
-You're dating Lloyd Russell?
-Yeah.

13
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:50,363
The Coast Guard's fishing for Cubans,
and l slept with a prostitute.

14
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:53,929
Please. Which of those kids
is my boss's daughter?

15
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:57,643
-That would be me.
-This is bad on so many levels.

16
00:00:57,853 --> 00:01:01,084
-Josh, don't ever do it again.
-Yes, sir.

17
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,484
Mrs. Landingham, what's next?

18
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,651
Are you crazy?

19
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,563
-Have you lost your mind?
LLOYD: Mandy.

20
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:42,045
-Let's go to my office.
-Why'd you make that deal? Shut up!

21
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,767
-Why? Lloyd!
-Just until after the midterms.

22
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:46,765
lt keeps it in committee--

23
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:50,244
The White House will veto it
when no one's looking.

24
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:53,047
-We want them looking!
-We should go.

25
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:55,853
Why did you make that deal?

26
00:01:56,093 --> 00:02:00,564
-For a spot at the nominations.
-l might nominate the president.

27
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:03,241
-Possibly keynote.
-Definitely prime time.

28
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:05,131
Of course they offered it!

29
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:08,649
-They don't want you nominated!
-Settle down.

30
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:12,488
That bill was our coming-out!
Our ''Nessun Dorma! ''

31
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,928
-What?
-ltalian aria by Wagner.

32
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,970
Puccini. Wagner's German.

33
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:19,932
-ls everything all right?
-No, it's not!

34
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,165
l left a top-tier marketing firm. . .

35
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:25,643
. . .to get him elected president.

36
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:29,926
But he made a deal to hold 443
until after midterm!

37
00:02:30,173 --> 00:02:33,563
Avoiding national exposure!
Our only hope. . .

38
00:02:33,813 --> 00:02:35,644
. . .of making a challenge!

39
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:38,282
-We've got a caucus.
-Hang on.

40
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:42,452
-Lloyd, l was going to--
-Listen to me.

41
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:48,208
lt wasn't gonna happen.
Maybe somewhere down the road.

42
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:52,844
-Not this year.
-l had two years to make it happen.

43
00:02:53,053 --> 00:02:56,250
They beat me before
l got my boxes unpacked.

44
00:02:56,453 --> 00:03:00,890
-You'll bounce back. You've got spunk.
-l'll kill you with my shoes!

45
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,204
lt wasn't gonna happen.

46
00:03:08,493 --> 00:03:10,245
You know the worst part?

47
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:14,486
l think you dinged up
your suspension pretty good.

48
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:18,646
lt's the party they're having
at my expense.

49
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,127
No, they're not.

50
00:03:20,373 --> 00:03:24,252
l worked with these people.
They like to win, then gloat.

51
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,324
-You're wrong.
-l'm not.

52
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,167
There are serious people there.

53
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:34,049
A blow was struck
for party unity this morning.

54
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:36,410
There's no cause to gloat.

55
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:41,482
Victory is mine!
Great day in the morning, people.

56
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:44,042
-Josh.
-l drink from glory, Donna.

57
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,853
Bring me the finest bagels
in the land.

58
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,244
lt's gonna be an unbearable day.

59
00:04:37,293 --> 00:04:41,172
-How did they refuse?
-They declined the invitation.

60
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:46,328
-Decline a photo op with the president?
-lt's the luck we're having.

61
00:04:46,573 --> 00:04:48,245
-Because of the joke?
-Yes.

62
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,563
-Who's that?
-Who cares?

63
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,724
You try getting his attention.

64
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:58,171
-Does the president have free time?
-Nothing but time, Toby.

65
00:04:58,413 --> 00:05:02,531
He's eating Cheerios
and enjoying <i>Regis and Kathie Lee.</i>

66
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:05,645
Sarcasm's disturbing
from a woman of your age.

67
00:05:05,853 --> 00:05:08,845
-What age would that be?
-Late 20s.

68
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:10,884
-Thattaboy.
-Can l have a cookie?

69
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,368
-They turned us down?
-C.J.'s on it.

70
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,843
Good morning, Sam. Have a cookie.

71
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,088
Thank you.

72
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:20,086
They're issuing a press release.

73
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,688
-Because of the joke?
-Yes.

74
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,242
Give me a serpent to slay.

75
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:29,651
-What's his problem?
-He's drinking glory. He wants bagels.

76
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:31,042
-Good job.
-Thank you.

77
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,448
-They turned us down?
-Declined.

78
00:05:33,653 --> 00:05:36,087
-What's that mean?
-They turned us down.

79
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,722
-The joke?
-Why does everyone ask?

80
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:42,886
-$32 billion against the surplus.
-Jaworski knows that's no good.

81
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,926
He'll say the Japanese
need to buy U.S. cars.

82
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:49,165
-Americans need to buy U.S. cars.
-l told him.

83
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,085
-Morning. What do you got?
-Morning.

84
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,927
-443 will stay in committee.
-l heard.

85
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:57,569
-The Ryder Cup team declined.
-You're kidding.

86
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,644
-The joke.
-You're kidding.

87
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,167
The Ryder Cup team.

88
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:05,326
-The best golfers in the country--
-l know what it is.

89
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:09,845
Sir, this may be a good time
to talk about your sense of humor.

90
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:13,722
l've got intelligence, security
and budget meetings. . .

91
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,362
. . .scheduled for the same 45 minutes.

92
00:06:16,613 --> 00:06:18,444
-Sure this a good time?
-No.

93
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:21,526
-Me neither.
-But it's not the first time.

94
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,889
-l know.
-lt's about Texas.

95
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:28,848
When asked about campaigning in Texas,
you say you look bad in funny hats.

96
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:30,850
-''Big hats. ''
-So what?

97
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:32,532
lt makes a difference.

98
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:35,651
-Point is, we got whomped in Texas.
-Twice.

99
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,930
-ln the primary and in November.
-l was there.

100
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:41,368
And it was avoidable, sir.

101
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:44,969
Your tombstone will read
<i>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc.</i>

102
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:48,046
None of my visitors will understand.

103
00:06:48,293 --> 00:06:53,128
27 lawyers in the room. Anybody
know ''post hoc, ergo propter hoc''?

104
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:56,365
''Post,'' after. ''After hoc. ''
''Ergo,'' therefore.

105
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:59,047
''After hoc, therefore''
something ''hoc. ''

106
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,051
-Next?
-lf l'd gotten more credit on 443--

107
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,682
''After it, therefore because of it. ''

108
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:08,642
One thing follows another,
therefore caused by the other.

109
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,532
But in fact, it's hardly ever true.

110
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:15,243
We did not lose Texas
because of the hat joke.

111
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:19,122
-Know when we lost Texas?
-When you learned to speak Latin?

112
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,490
-Go figure.
LEO: What else?

113
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:26,251
-Capt. Tolliver, coffee?
-l'm fine, Nancy.

114
00:07:26,493 --> 00:07:28,051
-Morris, good to see you.
-Morning.

115
00:07:28,253 --> 00:07:29,845
-He's backed up.
-l see.

116
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:32,846
Sam, when are you writing
the Hilton Head?

117
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:36,847
-Noon to 3.
-Let me see it at 3.

118
00:07:37,053 --> 00:07:38,247
l'll be a second.

119
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,125
Take a walk with me.

120
00:07:40,373 --> 00:07:42,568
-You look well.
-l feel good.

121
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,451
-How's the baby?
-1 0 days old.

122
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:49,443
-You got a picture?
-Let me see. What do you know?

123
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,968
-She's a knockout.
-Both of them.

124
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,522
-l forgot your wife's name.
-Angela.

125
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:56,331
-And the girl?
-Corey.

126
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,485
Did you tell council
they'd be in on the 1 0:00?

127
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,691
-l may have.
-You'd want to tell me that.

128
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,891
lt's a baby and a new mother.
Look at that.

129
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,842
l know you're just
filling in for Terry Wyatt. . .

130
00:08:10,093 --> 00:08:13,244
. . .but the president
would like to keep you on.

131
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,042
l don't have objections,
but l'm leaving in a few hours.

132
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:18,851
-Where you going?
-Jordan.

133
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,890
-For how long?
-A week.

134
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,044
-You'll start the week after.
-Leo.

135
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:25,281
l'm low-ranked.

136
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:30,323
He feels better talking to you.
Some days you've lightened the load.

137
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:33,133
-lt's an awful big load.
-He likes you.

138
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,846
l gotta get back.

139
00:08:35,093 --> 00:08:36,651
Give him his picture.

140
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:55,762
-Hey.
-Hey.

141
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:58,851
88B is ready.
Matthews wants to know what we know.

142
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,645
-l have news.
-Good?

143
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:04,129
You could see it as bad.
l think it's good.

144
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:07,251
Lloyd Russell is no longer our client.

145
00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:08,772
-Really?
-Yes.

146
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:11,049
-He's our only client.
-Was.

147
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,842
-This is a disaster!
-lf that's your spin on it--

148
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:18,443
He wants to work
with the president on 443.

149
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:21,844
-You lost our client?
-We're a team, Daisy.

150
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:23,651
-l quit my job.
-So did l.

151
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,845
-After putting $500,000 away.
-l saved wisely.

152
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,122
How will you pay me?

153
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:30,762
Typical of you to leap to that.

154
00:09:31,013 --> 00:09:34,449
No, it's ''typically'' my landlord,
college loans. . .

155
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:37,048
. . .the guy who sells me milk.

156
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:41,041
l have expenses too!
Credit cards, condo payments.

157
00:09:41,293 --> 00:09:43,648
Plus l dinged my BMW's suspension.

158
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:47,448
-What will we do?
-l'm formulating a plan.

159
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:52,843
Josh? You owe me $ 1 00.
l entered you in the football pool.

160
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,089
-Without telling me?
-lt's a surprise.

161
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:56,851
-And?
-You lost $ 1 00.

162
00:09:57,093 --> 00:09:58,685
-On?
-Central lndiana State.

163
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,764
-What was the line?
-lt wasn't like that.

164
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,163
-What was it?
-You pick the winner.

165
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,563
-You picked them?
-Fighting Okies.

166
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,883
-Who were they playing?
-Notre Dame.

167
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:12,649
-You picked them against Notre Dame?
-Technically, you did.

168
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,688
Toby! We need to do something.

169
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:18,288
-Ryder Cup team.
-They're just the latest.

170
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:21,172
-The Banking Committee.
-New Jersey, G-8.

171
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,766
The bicycle under the tree.

172
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:25,726
l'm not sure what our new
media director would have done.

173
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:30,330
We need a new one. l've done
better talent shows than our events.

174
00:10:30,573 --> 00:10:32,529
-Talent shows?
-When l was a kid.

175
00:10:32,773 --> 00:10:35,333
-Let's double-team him.
-With Sam and C.J.

176
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:40,089
We need to gang up on him.
lt won't be Mandy, right?

177
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,722
-Nope.
-Anyone but Mandy!

178
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,369
''Post hoc, ergo propter hoc?''

179
00:10:45,613 --> 00:10:47,843
Bet that had them rolling.

180
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,250
Be funny. You're best
with a pie in your face.

181
00:10:51,493 --> 00:10:54,053
l'd hold back, keep it in your pocket.

182
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:58,166
Don't like the rhythm of the Q-and-A?
Use the Ryder Cup.

183
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,449
Folks, please take your seats.

184
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,491
<i>We're gonna start the briefing.</i>

185
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,645
<i>Please take your seats, folks.</i>

186
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:15,170
Good morning.
We've got a birthday today, right?

187
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,641
-Suzanne?
-Bobbi.

188
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:19,242
-lt's Bobbi's birthday.
-lt is.

189
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:25,050
The vice president commented on the
White House position on the A3C3. . .

190
00:11:25,253 --> 00:11:27,289
. . .saying, and l quote:

191
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:32,448
''This is a time when the president
needs our support. '' Can you clarify?

192
00:11:32,653 --> 00:11:35,042
No, l haven't spoken with him.

193
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:38,285
The language seems strained,
doesn't it?

194
00:11:38,653 --> 00:11:39,642
Strange?

195
00:11:39,893 --> 00:11:43,488
Strained. ''This is a time when
the president needs our support. ''

196
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:45,724
Sounds pretty straightforward.

197
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:50,763
lf you consult the morning releases,
you'll see in sports. . .

198
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,846
. . .we got dissed
by 1 2 guys named Flippy.

199
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:56,682
Questions?

200
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:59,762
Did this have to do with the joke?

201
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:02,527
Will the president
make an apology?

202
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,643
<i>It was a surprise to discover</i>
<i>professional golfers...</i>

203
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,730
<i>...don 't have a sense of humor.</i>

204
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:14,249
<i>Especially after seeing</i>
<i>some of the outfits.</i>

205
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:15,442
-Hey.
-Hey. What's up?

206
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:19,168
She discovered that Hoynes
responded to an A3 question:

207
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,723
''This is a time when
the president needs our support. ''

208
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,771
-Third one.
-She moved to the Ryder Cup.

209
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,446
-Wouldn't you?
-Yeah.

210
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:31,447
-Get her to keep this off Leo's desk.
-l think it goes on it.

211
00:12:31,653 --> 00:12:34,167
That quote will disappear.

212
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:37,564
A fight between Leo
and the VP's got juice.

213
00:12:37,813 --> 00:12:40,850
-Talk to C.J.
-l will.

214
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,130
-Did you need me?
-Sorry?

215
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:51,445
-You come to see me?
-Stretching my legs.

216
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:55,123
l'm supposed to be working
on the Hilton Head draft. . .

217
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,933
-. . .but l'm just stretching my legs.
-Okay.

218
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:01,529
Last week l met a woman named Laurie.

219
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,082
We spent the evening together.

220
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,649
The next day l discovered
she was a call girl.

221
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:11,766
-Sam, do you want to close the door?
-Yeah?

222
00:13:12,413 --> 00:13:13,846
Yeah.

223
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:21,768
-You slept with a call girl?
-No, l-- Yes, l did.

224
00:13:22,013 --> 00:13:25,608
-She know who you are?
-l didn't reveal my secret identity.

225
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:26,848
l'm asking--

226
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:30,011
-She knows l work for the president.
-You think--

227
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,202
She wouldn't talk.

228
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:34,371
-How do you know?
-l know.

229
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,447
-You want to call her.
-l like her. She's not what you think.

230
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:43,050
l only know she's a call girl. ls she?
Then she's what l think.

231
00:13:43,253 --> 00:13:46,962
-l left abruptly.
-You're gonna try to reform her.

232
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:50,649
l want to say a proper goodbye
that shows respect.

233
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:55,171
-You'd like her if you met her.
-Promise that won't happen.

234
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:59,804
You're with the energy secretary
in five minutes. What's going on?

235
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,287
-Nothing.
-Really?

236
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:02,648
-You're lying?
-Yes.

237
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,724
-l should get out?
-Yes.

238
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:09,287
-Whatever quest--
-lt's not a quest.

239
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:12,172
You're playing with fire.
Talk to Toby.

240
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:15,450
-No way to do this without Toby?
-No.

241
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,843
Hang on! C.J. !

242
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:20,965
Talk to Toby. Just Toby.

243
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:22,566
You're late.

244
00:14:22,813 --> 00:14:24,007
l'll kill him.

245
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:26,932
-l'd definitely talk to him.
-Oh, l will.

246
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,249
-Stay on the perimeter.
-l have been.

247
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,451
l don't want it on Leo's desk.

248
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,446
Thank you!

249
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,570
(SPEAKlNG lN FRENCH)

250
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:56,729
-Stevie. Does he have time?
-We're leaving for NY.

251
00:14:56,973 --> 00:15:00,045
-Just a minute.
-l'm looking at my watch.

252
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:02,647
Good luck!

253
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:07,768
Excuse me, Mr. Vice President.
l wanted to talk to you about A3C3.

254
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:10,049
l apologize. Things happen quickly.

255
00:15:10,253 --> 00:15:13,290
Sometimes people get left behind.

256
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:16,445
The most he was talking about
was $6 an acre.

257
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:17,728
We're fixing it.

258
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:21,727
-Had we properly briefed you--
-Bill, $6 an acre!

259
00:15:21,973 --> 00:15:25,488
Nice of you to find me,
but l've been in the loop.

260
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:29,043
They keep saying ''This is a time
when the president needs our support. ''

261
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:33,047
-Possibly interpreted as--
-l've got a press secretary.

262
00:15:33,293 --> 00:15:36,046
-Yes, sir.
-Gotta run.

263
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:37,652
Yes, sir.

264
00:15:42,453 --> 00:15:44,842
-What's in Jordan?
-Amman.

265
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:48,090
Stay. We've got
''Amman,'' a woman, the works.

266
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,052
-1 31 over 84.
-That was a joke.

267
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:53,448
-Good one.
-Everybody's a critic.

268
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:54,682
Hold still.

269
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,447
-What's in Amman?
-A teaching hospital.

270
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:00,446
-Good for you. How long will you stay?
-A week.

271
00:16:00,653 --> 00:16:02,166
-When do you leave?
-Two hours.

272
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:04,483
-What's my temperature?
-56 degrees.

273
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,452
-Fahrenheit?
-ls that not normal?

274
00:16:07,653 --> 00:16:10,087
-How's the kid?
-1 0 days old today.

275
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,449
-Can she spell anything?
-No.

276
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:15,373
-Any pictures?
-Thought you'd never ask.

277
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:19,361
-Sir, they touched down at Andrews.
-Thanks.

278
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:21,532
What's her name?

279
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:26,005
Corey. My grandmother's name
from her great aunt. . .

280
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:29,569
. . .who got it from
the first free woman she met.

281
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:33,368
-Name's got a past.
-My family is proud of its past.

282
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:35,086
Your wife's beautiful.

283
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,166
-You trick her to marry you?
-Hypnosis.

284
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:39,846
l figured.

285
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:44,724
l made a joke about golfers.
Now it consumes the whole building.

286
00:16:44,973 --> 00:16:46,645
Open your mouth, sir.

287
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:52,091
Jokes are part of my folksy charm.
lt's the heart of my popularity.

288
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:55,245
lsn't your job-approval rating
three percent?

289
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:58,650
We're having difficulty
getting the word out.

290
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,407
-ls this from this morning?
-Yes, sir.

291
00:17:04,373 --> 00:17:05,647
How's my pulse?

292
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:08,361
You just run the stairs
at the Rose Bowl?

293
00:17:08,613 --> 00:17:10,046
-No.
-Then it's not good.

294
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:12,448
-Cut back on red meat? Dairy?
-Yeah.

295
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:17,483
-How about booze?
-Sure. Two Dewar's on the rocks.

296
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:22,252
l had a meeting this morning
with the Joint Chiefs.

297
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:25,891
l'm an accomplished man, Morris.

l sit comfortably with prime
ministers and presidents.

299
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:34,729
With the Joint Chiefs, l feel
l'm back at my father's dinner table.

300
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:36,645
l'm a naval officer, l--

301
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:40,050
You're a doctor in a uniform.

302
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:45,970
lt's not like l'm without experience.
l'm a former governor.

of the NH National Guard.

00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,082
-Got in tough scrapes?
-Didn't have to.

305
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:56,531
We'd stand on the border and stare
you down, then go for pancakes.

306
00:17:56,773 --> 00:17:59,890
Like you had combat training
in premed.

307
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,044
-Hold still.
-What is that?

308
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,164
-Flu shot.
-l don't need one.

309
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:08,565
Maybe this is a military coup?
l want the Secret Service.

310
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:13,841
ln a coup, why would the Secret
Service be on your side?

311
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:17,648
-That's a thought that will fester.
-Hold still.

312
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:23,052
Thank you.

313
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,850
l'm not comfortable with violence.

314
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:33,883
l know we have enemies but
l don't feel violent toward them.

315
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:36,772
l don't know if that's a weakness. . .

316
00:18:37,013 --> 00:18:41,245
. . .but l know how the Joint Chiefs
would answer that.

317
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,365
Let the Chiefs get to know you.

318
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:47,923
They're naturally suspicious
of your leadership.

319
00:18:48,173 --> 00:18:52,769
That comes from a lifetime between
the devil and the deep blue sea.

320
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,767
They're men of character.
They may not like your resume. . .

321
00:18:57,013 --> 00:19:00,050
. . .but in time,
they'll like you personally.

322
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:04,849
You have a once-in-a-generation mind.
They'll respect that.

323
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:08,250
They'll advise you well
and go where you point.

324
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:12,651
Let them get to know you.
ln the meantime, you outrank them.

325
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,562
-Don't worry. And cut back on dairy.
-And red meat.

326
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:17,928
And the Scotch.

327
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:21,848
Don't forget your picture.
Corey's a beautiful child.

328
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:24,089
l know. Look what l done.

329
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,564
You did nothing. You were a passenger.

330
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:30,850
You pay the bills
and do what they tell you.

331
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:34,290
Also, teach her to whistle.
Her mother won't.

332
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,047
-See you next week.
-Two weeks.

333
00:19:38,653 --> 00:19:40,564
-Morris!
-Yes, sir?

334
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:44,646
Look at that picture again.

335
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,845
See?

336
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:53,851
The past isn't the only thing
your family can be proud of.

337
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:57,731
Yes, sir.

338
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:01,123
Go away.

339
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,047
You remember
Stuart White and Ray Finley.

340
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:10,370
l do, indeed.
Good to see you. . . .

341
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:20,048
-Yeah?
-Who do you want for the pool?

342
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,523
-Another $ 1 00.
-Gotta play to win.

343
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:26,083
-l see it different.
-Rocky Mountain College or Purdue?

344
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,484
Give me Yeshiva University
over the Cowboys.

345
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,052
lf you aren't--

346
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:33,926
-Leo will be ready in a half-hour.
-Thanks.

347
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,368
-You talk to Hoynes?
-Yeah.

348
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:37,966
-And?
-We're fine.

349
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:40,044
-You sure?
-Yeah.

350
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:43,046
We're fine.
Leo will call when he's ready.

351
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,046
-Anyone but Mandy.
-Right!

352
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:50,649
MANDY: Did you know l have a Ph.D?
-Yes.

353
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:53,287
-Some people don't know that.
-l do.

354
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:56,491
l've got a bachelor's degree
in art history. . .

355
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:00,931
. . .and a master's in communications
and a Ph.D. in political science.

356
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:05,644
-Yes.
-l'm accomplished and brilliant.

357
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:08,970
-And look how young l am.
-What about Gil McGreggor?

358
00:21:09,213 --> 00:21:11,283
Who would think with all that. . .

359
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,842
. . .l would be this young or cute?

360
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:15,930
-Gil McGreggor. Mandy!
-But here l am.

361
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:18,129
-l'm not calling him!
-Why not?

362
00:21:18,373 --> 00:21:22,002
-l'm not cold-calling like a salesman!
-Fine.

363
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,251
You do it.

364
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:28,247
Neither of us have to.
Things haven't gotten that bad.

365
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:33,368
Miss Hampton, we are on the stairs,
drinking wine out of paper cups.

366
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,045
l'd like it if you called me
Dr. Hampton.

367
00:21:37,293 --> 00:21:39,249
Give me the bottle.

368
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:45,205
(PHONE RlNGS)

369
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:49,483
-Seaborn's office.
MAN: <i>Danny for Sam.</i>

370
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:52,964
He's writing.
He asked me to hold calls.

371
00:21:53,213 --> 00:21:55,443
He just came out. Call you back.

372
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,172
-l'm done.
-Sure?

373
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:59,131
-Done polishing and tweaking?
-Yes.

374
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:03,048
l'm done tweaking. l'm done polishing.
Take it to C.J.

375
00:22:04,293 --> 00:22:05,646
Wait!

376
00:22:08,773 --> 00:22:11,333
Yes. l'm done. Really.

377
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:15,805
Wait for the U.N.'s statement.
lt's the least they can do.

378
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:18,891
The U.N.'s doing
the least they can do.

379
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:21,647
-What's up?
-Just stretching my legs.

380
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:24,083
-How's it going?
-Finished.

381
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,052
-The Hilton Head draft?
-l used tough language.

382
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:30,051
-''Political cover, counterproductive. ''
-Good.

383
00:22:31,413 --> 00:22:33,847
Now l'm just stretching my legs.

384
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:35,452
Good.

385
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:45,091
-Can l talk to you?
-Yeah.

386
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:47,645
-l'll shut the door.
-Okay.

387
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:58,246
About a week ago, l accidentally
slept with a prostitute.

388
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:01,724
-Really?
-Yes.

389
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,328
-With a prostitute?
-Call girl.

390
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:06,848
-Accidentally?
-Yes.

391
00:23:07,293 --> 00:23:10,365
-Did you trip?
-l didn't know she was one.

392
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:13,650
You didn't know when she
charged you for sex?

393
00:23:13,853 --> 00:23:18,244
She didn't. l didn't find out
about it until the next day.

394
00:23:20,453 --> 00:23:22,011
Where'd you meet her?

395
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:23,328
The Farnsworth.

396
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:24,722
-Anyone see you?
-No.

397
00:23:24,973 --> 00:23:26,042
-Sure?
-Yes.

398
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,045
-l was with Billy.
-Who?

399
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:30,562
-Kenworthy.
-Of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>?

400
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:34,647
We talked about Josh and Mary Marsh.
He left before l--

401
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:36,770
-Picked up a hooker.
-Call girl.

402
00:23:36,973 --> 00:23:40,010
An important distinction
to the grand jury.

403
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:43,053
l haven't broken any laws.

404
00:23:43,733 --> 00:23:45,166
-Who knows?
-Josh.

405
00:23:45,413 --> 00:23:46,528
-And?
-That's it.

406
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:51,683
Me, you, the hooker, the deputy
chief of staff, and the <i>Journal.</i>

407
00:23:51,933 --> 00:23:54,322
-She's not a hooker.
-Hang on.

408
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:58,486
l'd like to call her to be friends.
l don't see the danger.

409
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:01,645
You're gonna try and reform her?
You are.

410
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:03,684
She shouldn't feel like trash. . .

411
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:07,050
. . .because l'm not given
the benefit of the doubt!

412
00:24:07,253 --> 00:24:09,244
-Let's go.
-He's free?

413
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,844
-Did you know?
-Know what?

414
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:17,845
-With him.
-Yes.

415
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:22,371
-And you're not concerned?
-Who hasn't known forbidden love?

416
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:23,682
Spring break--

417
00:24:23,933 --> 00:24:27,084
We don't need an opposition party.

418
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,642
We do fine by ourselves.

419
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:35,364
Don't do anything stupid, okay?
Nice job on the Hilton Head draft.

420
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:38,366
-Three minutes.
-A full-time consultant.

421
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:41,844
The dollar's down three cents
against the yen.

422
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:44,846
We need an economic
stimulus package. . .

423
00:24:45,093 --> 00:24:48,051
. . .that wasn't put together
at an Amway rally.

424
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:50,721
-That's not this meeting.
-Fair point.

425
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:53,931
The Ryder Cup shouldn't
have ended up on us.

426
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,641
You'll let the DNC spend money?

427
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:59,043
-Absolutely.
-Who do we get?

428
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,971
-Mandy.
-Excellent choice.

429
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,851
Wait. What?

430
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:04,685
-Mandy.
-Recently unemployed.

431
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,925
l don't think Josh got
enough credit.

432
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,686
-We need her again.
-Mandy?

433
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,493
-We need her.
-This is an ambush.

434
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,052
l'm being mugged!

435
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:18,371
Can you think of a reason
that isn't personal? What?

436
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:20,331
She was my girlfriend.

437
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:22,325
Good enough. Let's do it.

438
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:26,248
-Hang on! l have objections.
-Like what?

439
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:29,166
-The president won't agree.
-He will.

440
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,847
-How do you know?
-l asked him.

441
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,532
Listen. Fine.

442
00:25:33,773 --> 00:25:35,252
l'm a team player.

443
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:39,844
As long as she understands
she answers to me and Toby.

444
00:25:40,093 --> 00:25:42,687
l don't want to go 1 5 rounds with her.

445
00:25:42,933 --> 00:25:44,252
-ls that it?
-Yeah.

446
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:45,608
Thank you.

447
00:25:45,813 --> 00:25:49,249
l'm drawing a chart for her
with lines and arrows. . .

448
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:53,048
. . .indicating she answers
to me and to Toby.

449
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:56,171
C.J., hang on a second.

450
00:25:56,413 --> 00:26:00,042
-Did you talk to Hoynes?
-For a minute this morning.

451
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:02,448
-About A3C3?
-Yeah.

452
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,684
-l mean, about the quote?
-Yeah.

453
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:08,130
-And?
-Miscommunication. He's on board.

454
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:10,771
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

455
00:26:11,013 --> 00:26:12,162
What kind of--?

456
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:16,042
His statement got truncated.
l'd leave it alone.

457
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:17,888
Okay.

458
00:26:18,213 --> 00:26:19,532
-Anything else?
-No.

459
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:22,048
l'll be in my office.

460
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:27,243
She answers to me
and she answers to Toby.

461
00:26:31,213 --> 00:26:32,362
BARTLET:
<i>Mrs. Landingham?</i>

462
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,287
l'm done, right?

463
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,843
Just some calls you can
make from the residence.

464
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:39,771
Thanks. What's in the bag?

the University of Nebraska. . .

466

-Yes, sir.

468
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:50,291
-They left me a shirt.
-Yes.

469
00:26:50,533 --> 00:26:53,286

472
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:03,048
-Morris said--
-l was gonna have Mario fix me one.

473
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,972
-He was very clear--
-You stole them.

474
00:27:06,213 --> 00:27:07,248
l didn't.

475

You are a cattle rustler.

478
00:27:16,973 --> 00:27:20,761
lf you say so.
And no Scotch tonight, sir.

479
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:24,642
Between you and Morris,
who needs a wife or a mother?

480
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,844
Good night, Mr. President.

481
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,327
-Christiansen?

482
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:32,642

488
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:42,685
-Silverman?

-What about Bartlet?
-What are you doing here?

490
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:51,969
Nobel Laureate in Economics?
Three-term congressman.

491
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,932
You look like you could use a client.

492
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,643
Want to work for the leader
of the free world?

493
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,524
Josh!

494
00:28:03,773 --> 00:28:05,491
lt took you long enough.

495
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:09,442
You cut me out for a year!
Sure, once the Ryder--

496
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,848
-We got rules.
-l don't care.

497
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:14,561
-What are they?
-One, she can't punch me.

498
00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:18,362
Two, don't get drunk
in the middle of the day.

499
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,887
-Agreed.
-Fine.

500
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,532
We appreciate this.

501
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:24,571
-lt's no favor.
-You're a good man.

502
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,929
-l am something.
-l want to die.

503
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:30,245
-How can we thank you?
-Her expression's enough.

504
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:32,643
-Get your coats. You hungry?
-No. Yes.

505
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:33,922
Let's go.

506
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:36,846
Three, and l can't
emphasize this enough. . .

507
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:39,527
. . .you answer to me and Toby.

508
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:43,288
We have charts
to outline the chain of command.

509
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,730
For instance,
you answer to me and Toby.

510
00:28:46,973 --> 00:28:48,531
-l understand.
-Do you?

511
00:28:48,773 --> 00:28:50,252
-Yes.
-Good.

512
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:54,645
ln your dreams. ln your little dreams.

513
00:28:56,773 --> 00:28:57,762
Excuse me.

514
00:28:58,013 --> 00:29:01,449
-The vice president is here.
-Thanks.

515
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,966
-Leo.
-Good evening, Mr. Vice President.

516
00:29:05,213 --> 00:29:06,441
Thanks, Margaret.

517
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:09,527
How was New York?

518
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:12,606
S&P's gonna raise
the city's credit rating.

519
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:15,850
Nice of you to call.
l don't see you enough.

520
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,725
-No?
-Margaret looks good.

521
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:21,682
-Did you blow off C.J.?
-ls that what this is about?

522
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:24,891
She doesn't need
to run to you every time--

523
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:28,967
She didn't. She covered your ass.
She's a good girl.

524
00:29:29,213 --> 00:29:31,647
When she tells you something. . .

525
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,243
. . .consider it a directive
from this office.

526
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:39,128
You want me to consider it
a directive from here?

527
00:29:40,093 --> 00:29:44,484
Let me consult the Constitution.
l'm not sure you get authority. . .

528
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:46,684
. . .to direct me to the men's room.

529
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:48,889
You want to do this now?

530
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:53,285
l have had it with you and your pal!
l got shoved into a--

531
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,932
Excuse me!

532
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:59,849
Me and my pal? You're referring
to President Bartlet?

533
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:02,732
-Yes!
-Refer to him that way!

534
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:06,723
-Good night.
-Don't do what you're doing.

535
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,852
Why shouldn't l keep on doing
what l've been doing?

536
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:12,850
Because l'll win. . .

537
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:17,649
. . .and you'll end up playing celebrity
golf the rest of your life.

538
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:23,050
How long do you expect me to stick
around and be his whipping boy?

539
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:27,650
Give this president anything less
than your full-throated support. . .

540
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,731
. . .and you'll find out
exactly how long.

541
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:41,043
-Good night, Leo.
-Good night, John.

542
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:09,766
Excuse me.

543
00:31:10,013 --> 00:31:11,287
-Hi.
-Hi.

544
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:14,445
-l'm looking for Laurie.
-l don't know her.

545
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:16,968
-That's not her real name.
-lt's not?

546
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:22,048
Actually, it is. The one you
know her by isn't. l saw her with you.

547
00:31:22,293 --> 00:31:26,047
-l remember you.
-More good news for Toby.

548
00:31:26,293 --> 00:31:28,568
-What?
-Nothing. Where is she?

549
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:30,849
She's in the back.

550
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,168
Thank you.

551
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:34,881
-She's busy.
-Only take a sec!

552
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:40,048
Hong Kong? That place has gone
downhill since they changed chefs.

553
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:43,925
-Hi.
-Hi!

554
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:46,971
l come for a drink and here you are.

555
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,532
How about that?

556
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:50,446
-How you doing?
-Hi.

557
00:31:52,053 --> 00:31:53,611
This is--

558
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:57,444
-Sam Seaborn.
-From the White House?

559
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:03,005
-l've known her my whole life.
-How do you know Brittany?

560
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,647
-Who's Brittany?
-l am.

561
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:11,246
-We're in the middle of something.
-l don't mean to interrupt.

562
00:32:11,493 --> 00:32:15,452
l'll just call my friend
the Assistant Attorney General. . .

563
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:20,050
. . .and see if he wants to meet
with me and that woman back there.

564
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:21,845
Excuse me.

565
00:32:22,813 --> 00:32:24,246
Good to see you.

566
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:26,052
Okay.

567
00:32:30,013 --> 00:32:31,162
Laurie!

568
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:35,566
-l called you four times.
-Stay away. l can't believe you.

569
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:38,128
l left my coat. l can't go back.

570
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,933
lf l cost you money,
l'll write a check.

571
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:44,449
-You go to hell for saying that.
-l wasn't--

572
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:47,965
-That was the wrong thing to say.
-Yes!

573
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,488
-You'll freeze. Take my coat.
-No.

574
00:32:50,733 --> 00:32:51,848
Come on.

575
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:53,851
Give it to me.

576
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,851
l can't believe you said that
in there.

577
00:32:57,093 --> 00:33:01,769
l backed away from you quietly.
l never would have caused trouble.

578
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:04,447
Then you come in and brandish this--

579
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:08,447
By the way, the Attorney General
has no jurisdiction here.

580
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:13,443
l break the law in the District
and in Maryland and in Pennsylvania.

581
00:33:13,653 --> 00:33:18,283
l've never committed a federal crime.
More than l can say for your people.

582
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,842
-Absolutely right.
-l need a cab.

583
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,928
So l had a pretty good day.

584
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:28,488
Congratulations.

585
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:31,566
Feel like l'm affecting
policy discussion.

586
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:33,292
Why did you find me?

587
00:33:34,173 --> 00:33:38,451
Why did you call me four times
and then come and find me?

588
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:42,242
Just to tell you
l had a pretty good day.

589
00:33:43,173 --> 00:33:45,846
-l don't need saving.
-Yeah, you do.

590
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,369
l make more money than you do.

591
00:33:48,613 --> 00:33:51,411
You and any kid
with a decent paper route.

592
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:56,323
You understand l wasn't abused
as a child, that l like what l do?

593
00:33:56,573 --> 00:34:01,852
-lt's putting me through law school.
-No bar will admit you with a bust.

594
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:06,012
-l don't plan on that.
-As opposed to those who do?

595
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,852
-You look terrific tonight.
-Thank you.

596
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:11,647
l'm not saying that
to get my coat back.

597
00:34:11,893 --> 00:34:15,249
You'll try and change me,
arguing, asserting--

598
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:18,053
l'm a lawyer and a speechwriter.

599
00:34:18,293 --> 00:34:21,091
l'm sought after
because l'm good at it.

600
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:24,882
You humiliated me back there
and you scared me.

601
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:26,566
You understand that?

602
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,246
Yes.

603
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:32,564
And?

604
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,452
l guess that's just the way it goes.

605
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,848
-Not good enough.
-lt has to be.

606
00:34:38,093 --> 00:34:41,449
-Why?
-l've decided to be a friend of yours.

607
00:34:41,653 --> 00:34:44,213
Am l supposed to strip for you now?

608
00:34:44,453 --> 00:34:45,647
No.

609
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:50,247
-Really?
-Really.

610
