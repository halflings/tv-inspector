00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,207
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:11,564
- Flowers.
- I'll up your protection.

3
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:13,252
I'm starting college.

4
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:17,366
- This is Special Agent Gina Toscano.
- How do you do?

5
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:19,490
Zoey, walk on the other side.

6
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:22,207
- You like opera?
- You're asking me out.

7
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:25,246
- You got an itch for Seaborn.
- I do not.

8
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:29,446
Roberto Mendoza is the president's
Supreme Court nominee.

9
00:00:29,653 --> 00:00:31,928
Sam and Toby will be in charge.

10
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:36,365
It's gonna be a battle
I don't intend to lose.

11
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:44,165
<i>- Senator Crossfield.</i>
<i>- Yea.</i>

12
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:50,406
Congratulations, everybody!
Only one drink per person.

13
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:53,008
- Who's driving?
- Put it down!

14
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:57,092
- Put it down! No champagne.
- We're just--

15
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:02,612
Put it down. Everyone in this room,
let me have your attention.

16
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:07,449
The law mandates that presidential
appointees be confirmed...

17
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:11,771
...by a Senate majority
for a total of what?

18
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:17,206
Fifty-one votes is what we see
before a drop of wine is swallowed!

19
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:22,766
Because there's a thing called what?
"Tempting fate" is what it's called.

20
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:29,161
Since this man has been on
my radar screen, I have aged 48 years.

21
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:32,171
I will not have this day
screwed up by:

22
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:36,161
- By tempting fate.
- By tempting fate!

23
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,643
These things take patience,
skill, luck.

24
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:45,165
Since we've been in office,
what kind of luck have we had?

25
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:48,046
- Bad luck.
- What kind of luck?

26
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:52,363
- Very bad luck.
- We've had very bad luck.

27
00:01:55,973 --> 00:02:00,683
- Where's Josh?
- Josh? They're at 19 "yea" votes.

28
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:04,846
I need to talk to Mandy
about a banana bar?

29
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,412
Panda bear.

30
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:10,089
- Panda bear? That's a "D"?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,612
- That's an "E"?
- Yeah.

32
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:16,125
Show me where one word ends
and the next one begins.

33
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,689
- We have to go.
- She wants to talk about a panda?

34
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:25,769
- You sure you got the message right?
- Have I ever gotten a message wrong?

35
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:31,172
A panda's what I think it is?
Australian, eats off the koala tree?

36
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:34,291
- That's a koala bear.
- Panda's the other.

37
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,922
How can you not know the difference?

38
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:40,364
For someone who hasn't
mastered the alphabet--

39
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:45,369
- My penmanship is distinctive.
- It's illegible.

40
00:02:45,573 --> 00:02:47,768
- Where's Sam?
- Watching the vote.

41
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:50,891
- Can you believe him?
- Sam? No.

42
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,402
- You think you know a guy.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:55,769
- You don't know what I mean.
- No.

44
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,167
- Okay.
- Okay.

45
00:02:57,373 --> 00:02:59,648
<i>- Votes "yea."</i>
- Toby!

46
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,851
How about some champagne?
What the hell?

47
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,765
- Ginger?
- Tempting fate.

48
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,446
Go grab Leo.

49
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:10,163
It's distinctive style,
like Salvador Dali.

50
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,489
Please get Leo.

51
00:03:13,813 --> 00:03:16,771
I can't believe
you're talking like this.

52
00:03:18,053 --> 00:03:20,965
It's a book jacket, Sydney.

53
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:25,570
We're gonna make a federal
case out of a book jacket?

54
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,846
- It's time.
- I'll bring him here and talk to him.

55
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:35,002
We're closing what wasn't
the easiest confirmation process.

56
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,570
You'll understand if I'm not giddy
about the thought...

57
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:44,568
...of running into the embrace
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

58
00:03:45,653 --> 00:03:46,642
What was that?

59
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:51,005
An appointment favors
reparations to African-Americans.

60
00:03:51,213 --> 00:03:54,364
- What for?
- Keeping their ancestors as slaves.

61
00:03:54,613 --> 00:03:57,366
- What kind of reparation?
- Money.

62
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,763
- Hey, honey.
- Loser!

63
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,124
<i>Senator Pearson votes "yea."</i>

64
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,085
- Toby?
- Not yet.

65
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,409
- Our day of jubilee.
- Not yet.

66
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:10,648
- Sam.
- It's my day of jubilee.

67
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:14,004
I despise you
and everything you stand for.

68
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,245
My day was a bit better
a few seconds ago.

69
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,445
How could you write that?
Don't play dumb.

70
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:24,089
I am dumb. Most of the time
I'm playing smart.

71
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:27,205
Are you thinking about ruining my day?

72
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:31,372
- I was considering it.
- Fifty! Here we go, baby!

73
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,646
Sam, Toby, you're putting a guy
on the Supreme Court.

74
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:37,764
<i>Senator Rindell.</i>

75
00:04:40,453 --> 00:04:41,568
<i>Yea.</i>

76
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:48,051
Toby! How about now?

77
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:39,487
Dali had distinctive penmanship?

78
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,763
- Yes.
- How is it distinctive?

79
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:45,568
- For one thing, he wrote in Spanish.
- He was Spanish.

80
00:05:45,773 --> 00:05:48,606
Which accounts for his penmanship.

81
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,447
Am I interrupting
something important?

82
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:56,408
- I can't tell you how you're not.
- Do you mind if I have a...?

83
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:01,811
I'll go see if people are having fun
in the other room.

84
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:03,571
What's up?

85
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:06,571
Our assistant attorney
general nominee--

86
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,964
- It's gonna sail.
- It's not.

87
00:06:09,693 --> 00:06:13,368
- Breckenridge?
- Stadler has a problem with him.

88
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:16,810
- What?
- He supports slavery reparations.

89
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,850
- Since when?
- Whenever.

90
00:06:19,053 --> 00:06:21,248
Was there a thing?

91
00:06:21,453 --> 00:06:26,163
Two sentences on the back of a book
called <i>The Unpaid Debt.</i>

92
00:06:26,373 --> 00:06:28,807
- That's it?
- Stadler's unhappy.

93
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:33,882
- Because of a thing on a dust cover?
- I've been singing the same song.

94
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,561
- Talk to him tomorrow.
- Stadler?

95
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,283
- Breckenridge.
- I'm not the guy for this.

96
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,802
Yeah. You are.

97
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:46,772
- What's that?
- C.J.'ll do "The Jackal."

98
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:49,652
Where she lip-synchs? I love that.

99
00:06:49,893 --> 00:06:53,169
Toby's better.
Look at the confirmation.

100
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:57,127
Toby's barely alive as a result.
This one's you.

101
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,451
- Let's go watch.
- I'm a white guy from Connecticut.

102
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:06,408
Isn't this a delicate subject
to get into with a black lawyer?

103
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:09,446
- You're also Jewish.
- Then he'll love me.

104
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:12,690
- Where's Sam?
- In his office.

105
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:15,691
Tell him to come to the press room.

106
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,602
- It was a position paper.
- Vouchers are a good idea?

107
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,849
- How'd you get this?
- Your boss.

108
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:25,807
Your father? He's trying to drive
a wedge between us.

109
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,810
It worked.

110
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:30,891
- C.J.'s doing "The Jackal."
- Be right there.

111
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:35,325
We had something. You haven't
told me you favor vouchers?

112
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:38,570
Hang on.
We haven't been on a date yet.

113
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:43,648
- What kind of dates have you had?
- I'm a public school teacher.

114
00:07:43,853 --> 00:07:46,606
The other guys say, "Before we go--"

115
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:51,933
- Are you gonna be serious?
- No! You know why? I am off duty.

116
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:57,566
Toby and I put a guy on the bench.
I've earned my salary and then some.

117
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:00,970
I'm done.
Our date's supposed to be tonight.

118
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:05,689
We're gonna watch C.J. do "The Jackal,"
which is like Shakespeare.

119
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:10,045
We're gonna watch C.J.,
then get a late dinner...

120
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,483
...after which I may kiss you.

121
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,810
You're not doing a good job
on your part.

122
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:18,652
- I'm taking over.
- You're taking over?

123
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:21,003
- Let's go.
- Not much chance.

124
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:24,967
- Give me credit for trying.
- Good night, skipper.

125
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:28,611
Apparently you don't give me credit.

126
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:32,283
Yeah, come on, do "The Jackal" !

127
00:08:57,853 --> 00:09:01,368
Speed bump with Breckenridge.
Leo gave it to me.

128
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:04,650
He thinks you're
burned out on Mendoza.

129
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:08,209
- You're talking to me during this?
- I was--

130
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:12,565
- Never talk to me during "The Jackal."
- Sure.

131
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:35,324
- Hey.
- Hey.

132
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,491
Mallory read my position paper
on vouchers.

133
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:42,732
Really? How do you suppose
she got ahold of that?

134
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,810
You gave it to her.

135
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:47,607
Vouchers are a serious
subject with her.

136
00:09:47,813 --> 00:09:51,852
- Thanks.
- I don't mind you dating my daughter.

137
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,521
But don't expect me not to have fun.

138
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,043
Mallory and I haven't
actually been on a date yet.

139
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,966
You hang in there, son.

140
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,806
- "The Jackal"?
- What are you doing here?

141
00:10:51,053 --> 00:10:53,613
- I missed "The Jackal"?
- I was on fire.

142
00:10:53,813 --> 00:10:56,691
- That's gotta feel good.
- It does.

143
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,566
I'm home listening
to my police scanner--

144
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,531
- You have a scanner?
- I do.

145
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:05,282
You were president of your
school audio-visual club.

146
00:11:05,493 --> 00:11:09,930
Bobby Pfeifer was president.
I don't like to talk about it.

147
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,363
- Why'd you come?
- For a drink.

148
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,361
- You should've gotten here earlier.
- I was listening.

149
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:21,767
David Arbor was arrested at a party.
He'll be charged with possession.

150
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:26,643
- The son of Bob Arbor?
- Plus one other thing.

151
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:31,722
- There's one other thing? What?
- Zoey was at the frat party.

152
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:35,210
At least I know what I'll
be doing tomorrow.

153
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,723
Remember I came at 1
to tell you this...

154
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:42,482
...and also that you're
secretly in love with me.

155
00:11:42,693 --> 00:11:44,729
Make sure you remind my office.

156
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:48,767
You could do "The Jackal"
for me right now.

157
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:53,289
- Go home.
- Okay.

158
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:07,371
- Say, "I'm not sure the president knows."
- "I'm not sure he knows."

159
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:11,209
- It's a non-story. Say it.
- "I'm not sure he knows."

160
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:13,683
The father's a major fundraiser.

161
00:12:13,893 --> 00:12:17,772
I'm sure the president
will offer him his best support.

162
00:12:17,973 --> 00:12:20,362
There was a drug bust.

163
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,531
- Zoey left before that.
- Any reaction?

164
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,928
- I'm not sure he knows.
- There.

165
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,725
- C.J.
- It's a non-story.

166
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,810
Let's keep it that way.

167
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:33,083
- Hey.
- Did you get my message?

168
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,847
You wanted to talk about banana bars?

169
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:39,365
- Panda bears.
- Donna has stylish penmanship.

170
00:12:39,573 --> 00:12:44,089
- We should get a panda bear.
- I'll end up walking him.

171
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:48,889
You've gotten 3000 letters
in 10 days wanting to know...

172
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,163
...when we get the new bear.

173
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:54,888
- What happened to the old bear?
- Lum-Lum? She died.

174
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:56,731
- Did I kill her?
- No.

175
00:12:56,933 --> 00:13:00,403
- Why are you talking to me?
- 3000 letters.

176
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,049
- Did I write any? Then--
- Who should I talk to?

177
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:08,367
About getting a new panda bear
to replace Lum-Lum?

178
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,365
Toby. You should be talking to Toby.

179
00:13:13,613 --> 00:13:16,366
- This is most of it.
- Thanks.

180
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:20,043
- Toby?
- Yeah, Toby can help you out.

181
00:13:20,253 --> 00:13:21,288
What's this?

182
00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:25,725
I have to tell a black lawyer
why I don't owe him any money.

183
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:28,652
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

184
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,886
- Out in front of the entrance.
- How many?

185
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:47,489
- About a dozen.
- Have someone bring the car around.

186
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,524
- What time is it?
- 12:30.

187
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,611
I have to go.
Are we doing French at Kelly's?

188
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:56,203
- Yeah.
- Zoey, we're going out back.

189
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:58,324
- What's out front?
- Reporter.

190
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,843
- They're not supposed to.
- Security's on its way.

191
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:06,689
- What is up with Marjorie's hair?
- I didn't wanna say anything.

192
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:10,010
Gina, we go to sleep
listening to French tapes.

193
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:11,931
- I remember them.
- Ready?

194
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:21,569
I'm Special Agent Gina Toscano.
Your name?

195
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,003
Edgar Drumm. I have a question.

196
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:27,523
She doesn't answer questions.
Take her to the car.

197
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:32,602
So the president's daughter
is partying with drug dealers?

198
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,281
- David isn't a dealer.
- Why'd you go?

199
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:38,963
I was invited.
I didn't know David was there.

200
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:44,082
- I want you in the car now.
- You're a real jackass.

201
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,771
Don't do that again.

202
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:53,491
If this is how the Secret Service
behaves, it's a sad state of affairs.

203
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:57,368
We'll have to learn to live
with your disappointment.

204
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,842
This draft is done.

205
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,610
"On schedule" is my middle name
from now on.

206
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:17,725
- I'm having it changed.
- What was it before?

207
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:21,130
Norman. Speaking of schedules, Cathy--

208
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:25,082
At noon you're on the Hill,
3:00 the East Asia team...

209
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:29,286
...4:00 Medicare, 4:30 the president,
6:00 the advance team.

210
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:33,122
The noon meeting,
let's see if we can cancel it.

211
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,846
- Why?
- I don't wanna go.

212
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:38,170
- That's not enough.
- I really don't wanna go.

213
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:42,122
You're going.
And you've got Mallory at 11.

214
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,291
- What?
- You've got Mallory right now.

215
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,929
- What do you mean?
- Your appointment with Mallory.

216
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:52,284
I decided to see you
during business hours.

217
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,927
- You aren't in school?
- Not today.

218
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,284
I didn't wanna take advantage
of us dating.

219
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:02,003
- We're not. You made an appointment.
- All nice.

220
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:06,172
Isn't that adorable? Come in.

221
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:15,964
- Is he here? Send him in.
- Mr. Breckenridge?

222
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:18,846
- Thank you.
- Jeff, Josh Lyman.

223
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,203
- Jeff Breckenridge.
- Have a chair.

224
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,485
- Can Donna get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.

225
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:29,209
You were at Debevoise & Plimpton
when my father was a partner.

226
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:33,645
Your father was a partner?
Your father's Noah Lyman?

227
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:37,892
- Yeah.
- He's a wonderful man. How is he?

228
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,923
- He died.
- I'm sorry. When?

229
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:46,487
- The night of the Illinois primary.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:50,242
Thanks. I got this handed to me.
I'm not as up to--

231
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:54,207
A couple of Republicans
have a problem with me.

232
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,122
- Stadler.
- Also probably Wachtel and Tillison.

233
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,166
Any specific problem?
They don't like me?

234
00:17:01,413 --> 00:17:06,441
No, there's a book coming out
by Otis Hastings, <i>The Unpaid Debt.</i>

235
00:17:06,653 --> 00:17:11,443
His position is, African-Americans
are owed reparations for slavery.

236
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:15,407
- Yes.
- You're quoted on the back jacket.

237
00:17:15,613 --> 00:17:19,925
You wrote, "Otis Hastings
is a unique historian.

238
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:25,366
This book should be burned
into the minds of white America."

239
00:17:25,653 --> 00:17:30,249
- Yes.
- You weren't misquoted, right?

240
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:35,004
If asked, you'll say you're
in favor of reparations.

241
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:41,010
I'll tell them my father's fathers
were kidnapped outside Wimbabwa...

242
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:44,683
...and bought by a plantation owner...

243
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:49,171
...in South Carolina,
where they worked for no wages.

244
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:53,491
- And you're looking for back pay.
- Yes.

245
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,412
Did you have a figure in mind?

246
00:17:56,613 --> 00:18:01,164
Dr. Harold Washington, economist
at the Manchester Institute...

247
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:06,527
...calculated the number of slaves,
multiplied it by the hours worked...

248
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:11,966
...multiplied that by the market value
of labor and came up with a figure.

249
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:15,768
- What is it?
- $1.7 trillion.

250
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:21,846
This is probably a better discussion
to have in the abstract.

251
00:18:22,053 --> 00:18:24,965
- No.
- What do you mean?

252
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:30,770
I mean someone owes me
and my friends $1.7 trillion.

253
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:44,205
- Charlie's here.
- Yes, indeed. Charlie. Chaz.

254
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:48,082
- I hear you burned down the place.
- What's up?

255
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,763
Zoey had a run-in
with a reporter named Drumm.

256
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,405
- Writes for <i>The Charleston Citizen.</i>
- He's a Bartlet baiter.

257
00:18:56,613 --> 00:19:00,811
It's a newsletter for the radical
right. What did he ask her?

258
00:19:01,013 --> 00:19:03,447
Why she parties with drug dealers.

259
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:07,248
- Did she talk to him?
- Gina put her in the car.

260
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:10,604
David Arbor's a good friend.
He's not a dealer.

261
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:14,886
- Can you nip that in the bud?
- I can talk to a few people.

262
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:19,046
He only takes drugs.
Zoey is trying to help.

263
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:22,723
Zoey was bringing his car keys
she confiscated.

264
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,969
- Carol!
- Guy drives a Porsche.

265
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:30,122
I'm coming. I drove my boyfriend's
Porsche. Backed it into a pond.

266
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,972
- Lost your privileges?
- And boyfriend.

267
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,169
- It's a good car, though.
- Yeah.

268
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,808
- Hey, Toby.
- Hey there, Margaret.

269
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:47,322
- Are you okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

270
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,922
You don't usually say, "Hey there."

271
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:53,887
- What do I say?
- You growl something inaudible.

272
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:58,132
Not today. You should turn
that frown upside down.

273
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,403
Let a smile be your umbrella.

274
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:04,208
Now you're scaring
the crap out of me, Toby.

275
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:08,565
Hey, Bobby. Hi, Janet.

276
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:14,647
Tax dollars shouldn't go to shipping
students to private schools.

277
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:19,290
How are you getting around separation
of church and state on that?

278
00:20:19,493 --> 00:20:22,724
We have people who
are experts on that.

279
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,163
- I've noticed.
- Anything else?

280
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:28,524
- Oh, yes.
- We've been here for an hour.

281
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:32,123
Vouchers provide help
for only a few students.

282
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,732
We offer a solution.

283
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:38,802
You offer a lifeboat to the few
for whom vouchers make a difference.

284
00:20:39,013 --> 00:20:43,723
That makes sense. I just think
if you can save even one kid--

285
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,401
- You can save more than one kid.
- How?

286
00:20:46,613 --> 00:20:52,131
By asking Congress to approve a lot
more money for public education.

287
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,925
What?

288
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:58,604
Public education has been
a public policy disaster for 40 years.

289
00:20:58,853 --> 00:21:02,687
Having spent $4 trillion
on public schools since 1965...

290
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:08,365
...the result has been a steady
decline of student performance.

291
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:14,404
But don't worry, the House is on
the case. I feel better already!

292
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,691
- Wow.
- What?

293
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:22,681
For a guy who's trying to date me,
that was pretty snotty.

294
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,773
Hang on. These are office hours.

295
00:21:26,013 --> 00:21:29,926
I would've had
a whole different attitude.

296
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,169
- Thank God.
- That Hill meeting?

297
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:35,968
I'd love to keep talking,
but I have this meeting.

298
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,408
- I canceled it.
- Why?

299
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,403
You asked me to.

300
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,561
Yes, I did.

301
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,763
I'll get back to you.

302
00:21:51,573 --> 00:21:56,283
Danny? You hear anything about
Edgar Drumm talking to Zoey?

303
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,445
You never tell me
you like my suspenders.

304
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,123
- Drumm.
- He asked her about drug dealers.

305
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,732
That's what I heard.

306
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:07,731
She said she didn't know
Arbor was there.

307
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,685
- What?
- It's Edgar Drumm.

308
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,361
- Danny.
- It's Edgar Drumm. No one--

309
00:22:12,613 --> 00:22:16,049
- Yeah.
- What?

310
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:19,684
- Nothing.
- What?

311
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:24,364
Nothing. Those really are
nice suspenders.

312
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:31,047
- Special Field Order Number 15.
- What?

313
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:36,930
Slavery reparations aren't
anything new. January 16, 1865.

314
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:40,125
General Sherman issued
Field Order Number 15.

315
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:44,087
A half million acres
from South Carolina to Florida...

316
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:47,569
...were divided up
and given to freed slaves.

317
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:51,931
He also granted them the use
of various Army supplies--

318
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,408
Mules. 40 acres and a mule.

319
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:59,323
Yes, but the order was rescinded
four years later by Johnson.

320
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:04,369
During the Newark riots, you could
hear the looters shouting:

321
00:23:04,573 --> 00:23:08,088
"That was my 40 acres.
I'll be back for the mule!"

322
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:12,042
- Catchy.
- If you guys had paid up on time.

323
00:23:12,253 --> 00:23:16,724
A lesson well learned.
Let's talk about your confirmation.

324
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,924
Absolutely.

325
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:22,842
And while we're on the subject
of the Civil War...

326
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:28,923
...let's remember the 600,000 whites
who died over the issue of slavery.

327
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:33,092
- Is that why they died?
- It's why a lot of them died.

328
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:36,012
There's no other place in history...

329
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:39,410
...where an event like that
has occurred.

330
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:43,566
So let's leave it at that
and move on, okay?

331
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:45,684
- Except to say this:
- What?

332
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,682
- Nothing.
- What?

333
00:23:51,893 --> 00:23:54,088
Let's move on.

334
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,925
You got two seconds?

335
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:03,569
For you I have
all the time in the world.

336
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,644
- What?
- His day of jubilee.

337
00:24:05,853 --> 00:24:09,402
- He never sustains a good mood.
- You are dedicated.

338
00:24:09,613 --> 00:24:11,683
And you are other nice things.

339
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,242
- Can I see you inside?
- You bet.

340
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,170
I feel like I've lost 180 pounds.

341
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:21,649
I'm smiling, I'm laughing.

342
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:26,688
I am enjoying the people I work with.
I gotta snap out of this.

343
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:29,327
What's on your mind?

344
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:35,529
Help me get the Chinese to give us
a new panda bear to replace Lum-Lum.

345
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,885
That did the trick.

346
00:24:43,093 --> 00:24:44,765
- Hey!
- Hey, what's up?

347
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:46,372
C.J. wants to see me.

348
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,969
I talked to her.
She said she'll talk to Danny.

349
00:24:50,173 --> 00:24:52,733
- You could've kissed me.
- In the dorm.

350
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:54,764
- Chicken.
- When I kiss you...

351
00:24:55,013 --> 00:24:58,323
...I wanna be three miles away
from the Oval Office.

352
00:24:58,533 --> 00:25:01,366
Stacy says you're afraid
to show affection.

353
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:04,650
Tell Stacy to meet me
at Union Station.

354
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:09,927
Does C.J. have a problem? I wonder
what she wants to see me about.

355
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,364
I'm not afraid
of being affectionate in public.

356
00:25:21,413 --> 00:25:25,645
- See?
- Hey, Zoey. I'll get her.

357
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,768
- C.J.? Zoey.
- Thanks.

358
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,408
- Hi.
- Thanks for stopping by.

359
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:37,446
- Carol, can you get the door?
- Sure.

360
00:25:37,653 --> 00:25:42,852
You heard I talked to a guy.
I know I'm supposed to just walk away.

361
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:46,523
- He pushed your buttons.
- David isn't a drug dealer.

362
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:51,363
Did you tell him you didn't know
David was gonna be at the party?

363
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:54,889
I need to know why you lied to him.

364
00:25:55,093 --> 00:25:58,972
- I didn't.
- And why you're lying to me right now.

365
00:25:59,173 --> 00:26:03,007
If you didn't know,
why'd you have his car keys?

366
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:12,049
Mr. Clieg is being detained
by field agents in Albuquerque.

367
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:16,166
Mr. Hogabom threatened
to blow up the Smithsonian...

368
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:19,490
...unless Zoey Bartlet
agreed to meet him.

369
00:26:19,693 --> 00:26:25,643
Mr. Hogabom is in custody.
The Smithsonian remains open. Kelly?

370
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:29,562
The newest sorority stunt
is to get a picture with Zoey.

371
00:26:29,813 --> 00:26:32,725
Here's hoping our threat
is Kappa Kappa Gamma.

372
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,845
We're adding some hate groups
to the list.

373
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:40,763
The Aryan White Resistance,
the Christian Defense League...

374
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:44,050
...and Central New York White Pride.

375
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:50,362
Sir, the most recent letters have been
signed off with the slogan "14 Words."

376
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,490
What does that stands for?

377
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:56,163
"We must secure the existence of white
people and a future for white kids."

378
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,692
Right. What else?

379
00:26:57,933 --> 00:27:02,051
Two death threats were received
against Zoey and Charlie.

380
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:08,362
They were made with letters cut
from <i>Resistance Magazine.</i>

381
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:11,610
The magazine recruits younger people.

382
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:15,203
Right, and the letters
have used the phrase:

383
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,768
"Following the voice of blood."

384
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:23,093
It's the title of a Graveland record,
a band popular among skinheads.

385
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:27,292
I'm convinced we're looking
for two 15-year-old boys.

386
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:29,609
Everybody, hit the pictures.

387
00:27:29,813 --> 00:27:34,933
See who looks familiar from
the rope lines. It could be anyone.

388
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:38,523
Gina, C.J. Cregg's outside.
She wanted to step in.

389
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,166
- Sure.
- Hi.

390
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:42,841
They told me you were
having a briefing.

391
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:45,163
- I just need a minute.
- Coffee?

392
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,888
I'm fine. I need to talk
to you about last night.

393
00:27:49,093 --> 00:27:52,847
- Okay.
- Could you describe what, if any...

394
00:27:53,053 --> 00:27:57,808
...contact Zoey might've
had with David Arbor last night?

395
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,931
- No, I'm sorry.
- I don't understand.

396
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:04,887
I can't discuss the behavior
of my protectee.

397
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:09,803
Zoey's not in trouble. I'm trying
to straighten out a discrepancy.

398
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,732
I understand.

399
00:28:12,653 --> 00:28:15,451
There's a story
that Zoey's involved with.

400
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,292
I need you to tell me what you know.

401
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:23,567
I can't protect her if she feels
she's gotta do things behind my back.

402
00:28:23,813 --> 00:28:27,726
- I can't discuss her behavior.
- Okay. Thanks.

403
00:28:28,613 --> 00:28:34,290
The thing with the reporter this
morning was fast, it was physical.

404
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:38,202
She's 19, and she thought
her father was in trouble.

405
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:41,445
Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.
Sorry about--

406
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,087
- No problem.
- I'll see you later.

407
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:49,449
You sure about coffee? I'm looking
through a photo album of Nazis.

408
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:52,966
- Why?
- I'm on a break.

409
00:28:54,573 --> 00:28:55,892
See you later.

410
00:28:56,853 --> 00:29:02,769
It occurs to me that you attended
a private high school and college.

411
00:29:03,053 --> 00:29:04,042
Your point?

412
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:09,208
Liberals have no problem with
rich kids going to private schools.

413
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:13,964
No problem with middle-class kids
going to parochial schools.

414
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:18,052
But letting poor public school
students choose alternatives...

415
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,126
...would destroy
public education?

416
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:25,121
Boston Latin is still
the best secondary school here.

417
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,893
But they're not all Boston Latin.

418
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:32,564
Since when are liberals the other guys
in your conversations?

419
00:29:33,173 --> 00:29:38,770
- Excuse me. Hi, Mal. You got a second?
- Absolutely. Excuse me.

420
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,766
Edgar Drumm ambushed Zoey after lunch.

421
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:47,807
She said she didn't know Arbor
was there. She did.

422
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,443
- Why lie?
- Spend enough days around reporters.

423
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:55,692
We make sure the president
doesn't get involved.

424
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,566
- When he hears--
- You have to sit on him.

425
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:03,972
- I'm not gonna be able to.
- You can't back down. Get in his face.

426
00:30:04,213 --> 00:30:09,082
Get in the president's face?
That's your advice? Okay.

427
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:12,524
Does anyone else
have any advice that could--?

428
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:16,772
It's your job.
It's what he needs you to do.

429
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:21,525
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

430
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:27,968
I'd like to see Mallory socially,
but I can't get her past this fight.

431
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:32,812
Tell her you wanna
continue over lunch.

432
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,731
That's very good advice.

433
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,891
Certainly better than
"get in his face."

434
00:30:38,093 --> 00:30:40,766
- I'm going back.
- I'll check the want ads.

435
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:42,571
Good luck!

436
00:30:44,653 --> 00:30:48,009
- A panda bear to replace dim sum.
- Lum-Lum.

437
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,649
- Do you mean Hsing-Hsing?
- That was his name.

438
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:56,131
He was given to us as a gift from
the Chinese when Nixon--

439
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:59,211
- I know.
- Then Hsing-Hsing got lonely.

440
00:30:59,413 --> 00:31:02,928
The Chinese sent a mate.
I think its name was Ping.

441
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:04,691
- Ling.
- Ling.

442
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:06,611
- Maybe Ping.
- Whatever.

443
00:31:06,813 --> 00:31:10,089
Ping or Ling dies,
Hsing-Hsing mourns...

444
00:31:10,293 --> 00:31:14,127
...and for Hsing-Hsing
it seemed unendurable.

445
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,210
I know exactly how he felt.

446
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:21,931
Hsing-Hsing succumbed to liver disease
and passed away earlier this year.

447
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:25,967
As a symbol to signal
how serious we are...

448
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:31,606
...about our relationship with China,
we might ask them for another bear.

449
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:35,362
I think as a symbol
of China's seriousness...

450
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:40,209
...they could stop running over
their citizens with tanks.

451
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:43,291
Have them send a bear!
What's the problem?

452
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:49,363
Pandas are very rare. There are maybe
a thousand, and only in China.

453
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:51,410
- We only need one.
- Two!

454
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,651
- It'll get lonely.
- Have them send two.

455
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:57,413
China's not inclined to give us gifts.

456
00:31:57,613 --> 00:32:01,526
Get us two regular bears,
black paint, white paint.

457
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:05,169
The wildlife lobby
was nervous about you?

458
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:08,962
I know, I'm Mr. Wildlife. Mandy!

459
00:32:16,573 --> 00:32:21,522
- What made you think I'm interested?
- Josh said you were my man.

460
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,362
- Josh said I was your man?
- Yes.

461
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:33,841
- I'm impressed how much you've grown.
- What do you mean?

462
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:39,207
There was a time if you got played
by Josh, you'd wanna get back at him.

463
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:43,088
- "Played"?
- He used you to have fun with me.

464
00:32:43,293 --> 00:32:46,763
- He's gotta deal with Breckenridge.
- He played me?

465
00:32:46,973 --> 00:32:52,525
But it's good to see you
get past that. Played like a $2 banjo.

466
00:32:56,853 --> 00:33:00,209
- Help me.
- Do what?

467
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:04,929
Cause Josh pain.

468
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:08,482
Okay.

469
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:11,969
- Hey, Dad.
- Yeah. Hold on, please.

470
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,449
Sam asked me to lunch.
I need your permission.

471
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:19,009
- What do you need my permission for?
- Sam?

472
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:23,769
She always asks permission
before she has lunch with fascists.

473
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:27,170
- He's in favor of school vouchers.
- He's not.

474
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,852
- Yes, he is.
- No.

475
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,692
- I read the paper.
- It's opposition prep.

476
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:32,962
Opposition prep?

477
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:36,882
Before a debate, the smart guys
take the other side.

478
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,693
You argued with me. Why?

479
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:42,771
- You made an appointment.
- Take it outside.

480
00:33:42,973 --> 00:33:47,046
- You drove a wedge between us.
- Now you're boring me.

481
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:51,366
Education is the silver bullet.
Education is everything.

482
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:57,284
We need gigantic, monumental changes.
Schools should be palaces.

483
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:01,042
The competition for the best teachers
should be fierce.

484
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:04,563
Schools should be free
to its citizens...

485
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:08,766
...like national defense.
That's my position.

486
00:34:09,973 --> 00:34:13,204
I just haven't figured out
how to do it yet.

487
00:34:14,773 --> 00:34:17,241
You stood there
and argued with me.

488
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:22,243
We can continue.
We're gonna have lunch?

489
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:26,763
- You're taking over?
- I'm taking over.

490
00:34:28,813 --> 00:34:34,365
- You may go have lunch with a fascist.
- Come along, Sam.

491
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:39,765
- You're doing fine.
- Okay.

492
00:34:46,053 --> 00:34:49,807
Mr. President. Your lunch
with Mr. Girardi got canceled.

493
00:34:50,053 --> 00:34:54,205
It's the first time anyone's
canceled since I took office.

494
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:57,962
Mr. Girardi was taken
to the hospital with pneumonia.

495
00:34:58,173 --> 00:35:02,007
- He did have a good excuse.
- What are you reading?

496
00:35:02,253 --> 00:35:06,405
<i>Rules of Civility and Decent</i>
<i>Behaviour</i> by George Washington.

497
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:07,648
The Washington?

498
00:35:07,853 --> 00:35:11,926
The rules were drawn
from an English translation.

499
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:15,523
Washington copied them down
when he was 14.

500
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:21,683
"Sitting down, keep your feet firm and
even without putting one on the other.

501
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:27,172
Put not off your clothes
in the presence of others."

502
00:35:27,373 --> 00:35:31,161
What a tight-ass little priss
he must've been.

503
00:35:32,253 --> 00:35:33,322
Yes, sir.

504
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:37,291
Do you think I could
take Washington?

505
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:40,644
- Take him at what, sir?
- I don't know. A war.

506
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:44,084
Could you have taken
Washington in a war?

507
00:35:44,293 --> 00:35:48,002
You'd have the Air Force,
and he'd have the minutemen?

508
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:52,365
- Minutemen were good.
- I think you'd probably take him.

509
00:35:52,653 --> 00:35:55,645
- C.J.'s here.
- You can send her in.

510
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,366
- C.J. !
- Mr. President.

511
00:35:58,613 --> 00:36:04,210
"Put not your hands to any part
of the body not usually covered."

512
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:07,803
I do what it takes to keep
the press corps happy.

513
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:11,369
Yeah, you're right. What's going on?

514
00:36:11,853 --> 00:36:14,162
Don't blow your stack, all right?

515
00:36:14,373 --> 00:36:17,649
- What is going on?
- Zoey lied to a reporter.

516
00:36:17,853 --> 00:36:18,842
What?

517
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,443
She was asked,
"Should you party with dealers?"

518
00:36:22,653 --> 00:36:26,965
She said she didn't know
David Arbor was there. She did.

519
00:36:27,213 --> 00:36:28,328
Why did she lie?

520
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,489
- She didn't have to.
- Then why?

521
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:33,161
- Sometimes girls lie.
- She never has to.

522
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:35,847
- She knows.
- Apparently she doesn't.

523
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:40,564
Give her a break.
This thing's happened to her friend.

524
00:36:40,773 --> 00:36:43,446
Edgar Drumm's shouting at her.
She choked.

525
00:36:43,653 --> 00:36:46,247
A reporter talked to her on campus?

526
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:51,368
Put the press in the briefing room.
Tell them I'm coming over.

527
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:54,810
- No, sir.
- We have been over this!

528
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:57,083
They are not to talk to her.

529
00:36:57,293 --> 00:37:00,126
- It was Edgar Drumm.
- I don't give a damn.

530
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,933
- I'll talk to the press.
- You can't.

531
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:07,809
This is about the first daughter.
You're not going down there.

532
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:11,892
Only you, me, Charlie and Zoey
know she was lying.

533
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:14,971
It stays that way.
It's a non-story!

534
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:18,370
You go down there,
and it's a big story!

535
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:30,362
I just sit in my office and fume?

536
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:34,970
Yes. If anybody asks, you haven't
heard anything about it.

537
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,846
- Fine.
- Mr. President.

538
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:41,409
Did you know he jumped out at Zoey?

539
00:37:41,613 --> 00:37:44,207
Excellent.
I haven't heard anything.

540
00:37:44,613 --> 00:37:45,966
Very good.

541
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:50,291
- I could take George Washington.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:52,927
- Anything else?
- No, sir.

543
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:57,172
- Thank you, C.J.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

544
00:38:01,293 --> 00:38:04,683
We gave 1.2 billion
to Japanese-Americans...

545
00:38:04,933 --> 00:38:06,651
...who were in camps.

546
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:09,965
Bring me a living slave,
you got a case.

547
00:38:10,173 --> 00:38:14,963
I've got a case without that.
But I'm just a civil rights expert.

548
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:21,282
The committee is gonna be looking
for a certain degree of practicality.

549
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:26,647
In order to raise $1.7 trillion
we'd have to sell Texas and the Navy.

550
00:38:26,853 --> 00:38:29,606
I'm willing to give you a break.

551
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:32,532
We'll take our money
in tax deductions.

552
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:37,443
How about taking it in affirmative
action and the Civil Rights Act?

553
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:40,372
Three things we wouldn't have needed--

554
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:44,009
I'd love to give you money,
but I'm short on cash.

555
00:38:44,213 --> 00:38:49,162
The Birkenau SS officer forgot to give
my grandfather his wallet back.

556
00:38:49,373 --> 00:38:53,161
- Your beef's with the Germans.
- You're damn right.

557
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,171
What the hell are we talking about?

558
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,769
We have laws in this country.

559
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,965
You break them, you pay your fine.

560
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:18,526
You break God's laws,
that's a different story.

561
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:24,046
You can't sell a civilization into
slavery. No money makes up for it.

562
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:29,088
All you have to do is look 200 years
later at race relations.

563
00:39:29,293 --> 00:39:33,206
- Yes.
- No amount will make up for it.

564
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,011
You got a dollar?

565
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:44,883
- Yeah.
- Take it out. Look at the back.

566
00:39:48,293 --> 00:39:52,844
The seal, the pyramid,
it's unfinished.

567
00:39:53,053 --> 00:39:56,443
With the eye of God looking
over it and the words:

568
00:39:56,653 --> 00:40:00,692
"He, God, favors our undertaking."

569
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:04,932
The seal is meant to be unfinished
because this country is.

570
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:09,843
We're meant to keep doing better,
to keep debating.

571
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:13,409
We're meant to read books
by great scholars...

572
00:40:13,613 --> 00:40:18,562
...and talk about them, which is
why I lent my name to a dust cover.

573
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:23,565
I wanna be your assistant attorney
general for civil rights.

574
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:30,008
I'll do an outstanding job. You got
any problem with me saying that?

575
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:33,211
- No.
- Good.

576
00:40:33,413 --> 00:40:37,531
- You hungry? Let me buy you lunch.
- Yeah, okay.

577
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:45,568
Jeff, there'll be a lot of meetings
before your confirmation.

578
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:50,762
- Why don't you let me get lunch?
- Yeah, okay.

579
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,482
