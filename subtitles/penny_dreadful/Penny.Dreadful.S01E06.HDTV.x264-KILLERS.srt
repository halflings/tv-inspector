Because the truth is unendurable.

347

My late wife, Hannah,

she of the pale blue dress
with the embroidered flowers,

349

she did not succumb to a disease precisely.

350

351

heart and cut off her head.

355
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,074
Ah.

356

Have you considered an institution?

357
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:01,681
I went to take a look at one.

358
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:04,950
It was a prison with people
in big rooms waiting to die.

359
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:07,320
Do you hold out hope for her end?

360
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:09,188
I hold out dignity.

361
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,261
I would pay for a private
asylum in the country.

364
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:24,503
She will need opiates
before long, for the pain.

365
00:27:26,406 --> 00:27:29,008
She will cease being who she is.

368
00:27:43,857 --> 00:27:45,825
Why this ship?

369
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,426
It came from Cairo four months ago

370
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,628
and has been in quarantine since,

371
00:27:49,662 --> 00:27:51,897
for what they're vaguely describing as

372
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:56,001
"typhus or an unknown foreign disease".

373

You recall the hieroglyphic
tattoos we discovered?

374
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:00,372
Those were Egyptian.

375
00:28:00,406 --> 00:28:04,210
That, and the fact the ship's
in quarantine, is suggestive.

376
00:28:04,544 --> 00:28:05,878
Of what?

377
00:28:07,214 --> 00:28:08,747

Aestheticism, Ludditism,

Why have you told me this?

516
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:04,288
Because you would have come
to the same place without me.

And then?

518

You would have pursued it.

519
