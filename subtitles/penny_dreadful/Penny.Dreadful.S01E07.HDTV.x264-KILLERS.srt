1
00:00:07,368 --> 00:00:09,502
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

2
00:00:09,536 --> 00:00:11,904
There are tremors around us.

3
00:00:11,938 --> 00:00:13,373
Hidden music.

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,742
Some might be more attuned
to them than others.

5
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,744
What do those people do,

6
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:19,711
those who have been chosen?

7
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:21,680
Amunet and Amun-Ra.

8
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:25,217
If they ever came together, Amunet
would become the mother of evil.

9
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:26,451
You are not Sir Malcolm.

10
00:00:26,486 --> 00:00:27,787
Serpent.

11
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:30,089
Deceiver, Prince of
Darkness, Devil of the Pit?

12
00:00:30,123 --> 00:00:31,423
You've always been drawn

13
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:32,925
to the dark whisper.

14
00:00:32,959 --> 00:00:35,560
There are things within us all
that can never be unleashed.

15
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:37,296
Where've you been all night?

16
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,830
I went out with Mr. Gray.

17
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,432
He's a devil, that one.

18
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:41,933
The medal around my neck.

19
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:43,168
Would you wear it for me?

20
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:45,170
"No more let Life divide

21
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,806
"what Death can join together."

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,575
You're pretty goddamn sure you
know what's going on all the time.

23
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,911
There are things you can't control.

24
00:00:52,945 --> 00:00:56,480
At the end of the day, the only
thing we have is the people we trust.

25
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:57,682
And you trust her?

26
00:00:57,716 --> 00:00:59,750
You better start doing the same,

27
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,853
or get ready to lose a lot of battles.

28
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,387
Vanessa, I have a lot to tell you.

29
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:05,489
I haven't been honest with you about...

30
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,650
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

31
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:09,659
To be beautiful is to
be almost dead, isn't it?

32
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:12,278
Mmm...

33
00:03:12,313 --> 00:03:15,582
The lassitude of the perfect woman,

34
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:17,867
the languid ease,

35
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:20,153
the obeisance,

36
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,655
spirit-drained,

37
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:24,424
anemic,

38
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:28,660
pale as ivory and weak as a kitten.

39
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:34,233
There's a brisk trade for
photographs of dead women,

40
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:35,985
did you know that?

41
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:39,654
In certain quarters.

42
00:03:41,157 --> 00:03:44,527
The corpses are improved with cosmetics,

43
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:47,996
then posed in postures of abject surrender

44
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:50,565
and photographed.

45
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,135
The men circulate the pictures

46
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,637
and pleasure themselves.

47
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:59,073
Mmm, such exquisiteness.

48
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,609
Vanessa?

49
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:07,115
Do you hear me?

50
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,750
Of course.

51
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:12,686
Last evening, you went into a...

52
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:18,358
a spell, or a fit of a
kind, unlike previously.

53
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:19,861
Did I?

54
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,830
How arresting.

55
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:25,432
It was unnatural.

56
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:28,602
Do you not remember?

57
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,074
You've been asleep since.

58
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:34,458
Who dressed me?

59
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,927
Oh. Sembene and myself.

60
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,130
Did you make the tea then?

61
00:04:39,164 --> 00:04:40,731
What?

62
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:42,366
No. Sembene did.

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,300
And you dressed me?

64
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,736
Yes.

65
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,871
Like when I was a girl?

66
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:50,874
Oh, no. You didn't dress me as a girl.

67
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,909
How silly of me.

68
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,445
You weren't there to dress me, were you?

69
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,481
You were away on some trek or other.

70
00:04:58,816 --> 00:05:00,683
Who could keep them straight?

71
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,485
We tried to follow your
progress on that map

72
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,421
in the solarium with little red pins

73
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:09,258
but you were in terra incognita.

74
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,645
That's where you said you were going.

75
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:16,231
What adventure in those words.

76
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,401
Do you feel you are there again... Father?

77
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,272
Mina?

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,878
Somewhat.

79
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,449
Fat Mother wept, of course.

80
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,719
Is there anything more comical
than a fat woman weeping?

81
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:39,388
It never quite comes off.

82
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,856
You loathed her fatness.

83
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,792
Unlike those other women.

84
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:49,097
But fat Mother wept because she
missed you, and feared for you.

85
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,833
Wept and wept and then
she bit into her pillow

86
00:05:51,867 --> 00:05:53,201
so we wouldn't hear her,

87
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:55,469
and then she turned to
laudanum to sleep at all.

88
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,825
Poor fat thing.

89
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:08,649
Tell me about the other women.

90
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,919
Not Mrs. Ives, I know all about her.

91
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,954
You might have attended
the funeral at least.

92
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:15,873
For decency's sake!

93
00:06:22,197 --> 00:06:23,931
You stop this right now.

94
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,700
Ooh, it's that face, is it?

95
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:29,203
The hard face for the niggers.

96
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,671
Scare them into obeying.

97
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:34,541
The porters and slaves.

98
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:36,543
But we were speaking of the women.

99
00:06:36,577 --> 00:06:38,878
They were as follows...

100
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,913
The whores in Zanzibar when you landed,

101
00:06:40,948 --> 00:06:43,250
mostly North-African so almost white.

102
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,218
Then the native women along the way.

103
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:47,186
They enjoyed you pawing at them.

104
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,888
Or you convinced yourself they did.

105
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,190
You made Peter fuck them
to prove he was a man.

106
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:53,426
He didn't enjoy it, but he
would do anything for you.

107
00:06:53,461 --> 00:06:56,495
Except make a proper off
spin bowler like you wanted.

108
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,998
So on you went, tribe to tribe,

109
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,433
father and son, fucking the Maasai,

110
00:07:01,468 --> 00:07:03,770
the Mamohela, the Bangweulu...

111
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:06,037
the Bantu, the Burundi!

112
00:08:38,195 --> 00:08:40,964
Honestly, I'm sorry they've troubled you.

113
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:43,599
I'm quite well again.

114
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,735
And where did you receive
your medical degree, Dr. Ives?

115
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:50,423
Would you excuse us?

116
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:53,509
Go on, Sir Malcolm.

117
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:56,045
He fears for my modesty I think.

118
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,553
May I make a discreet examination?

119
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:07,289
Ah, discretion always.

120
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,065
What happened to your lip?

121
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,135
Sembene thought it
necessary to "sedate" me.

122
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:24,873
You've a steady pulse.

123
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:28,175
Yes, I believe I am still alive.

124
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,195
Would you come into the light for me?

125
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,824
And look up

126
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,427
to the left,

127
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:48,329
to the right.

128
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,197
I fear I'm not looking my best.

129
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:51,665
Nonsense.

130
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:53,867
Your visual responses
are perfectly adequate.

131
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,769
High praise.

132
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,437
No wonder you're not married.

133
00:09:59,774 --> 00:10:01,341
May I listen to your heart?

134
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:04,711
Such as it is.

135
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,083
- It's cold.
- I'm sorry.

136
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:11,918
I always forget that with the living.

137
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:15,721
Deep breaths.

138
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:22,128
What happened downstairs?

139
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,531
I couldn't rightly say.

140
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,534
Then wrongly say.

141
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:29,402
I don't remember.

142
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,739
It's a shambles.

143
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:35,324
Is it?

144
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:38,310
There was violence.

145
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:40,079
There usually is.

146
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:41,747
When's that?

147
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,549
When I go away.

148
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:44,650
Where do you go?

149
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,218
I don't know!

150
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:53,525
Meaning you will soon bring in an alienist.

151
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,976
No.

152
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:57,696
I don't favor that.

153
00:10:58,664 --> 00:10:59,931
Nor I.

154
00:11:04,837 --> 00:11:07,171
You must eat something.

155
00:11:07,206 --> 00:11:09,173
I'm not hungry for soup.

156
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,575
Well, I'm sure they will
give you anything you like.

157
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,678
Cornish game hen,

158
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,082
expertly carved

159
00:11:17,116 --> 00:11:19,683
by a beautiful boy in a restaurant.

160
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:23,721
You have very clean hands.

161
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,456
Yes, I suppose so.

162
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,892
Do you value cleanliness?

163
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:30,961
I suppose I do.

164
00:11:30,996 --> 00:11:32,796
That's why you're a virgin.

165
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,666
Or maybe not.

166
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,434
Who can tell about such things?

167
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:38,669
Such hidden things.

168
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:42,305
Such secrets we all have, don't we, Doctor?

169
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,511
There's a line from Shelley that haunts me.

170
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,813
A single line, from Adonais.

171
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:52,649
I can't seem to get it out of my head.

172
00:11:56,354 --> 00:11:58,421
"No more let Life divide

173
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,090
"what Death can join together."

174
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:08,298
Your clean hands are trembling.

175
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:09,832
Are you afraid?

176
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:11,968
Not of you.

177
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:14,537
You think you know a greater demon?

178
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,405
Tell me of him,

179
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:18,407
or shall I tell you?

180
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,585
Is the examination over?

181
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:31,620
It has not yet begun.

182
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:46,902
I've called Mr. Chandler to assist us.

183
00:12:46,936 --> 00:12:50,272
It has happened before,
but never to this extent.

184
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,341
She fights it as best she can.

185
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,843
What brings on the fits?

186
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,078
I don't know.

187
00:12:56,112 --> 00:12:57,645
Emotion of some kind.

188
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,879
What brought on this one?

189
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,648
I don't know.

190
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,285
I must ask you a difficult question.

191
00:13:05,554 --> 00:13:08,089
Has she experienced
sexual trauma in her life?

192
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:09,824
I've no idea.

193
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,225
Is she intact?

194
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,229
I wouldn't have thought so.

195
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,764
I place no judgment on that.

196
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:19,533
I have no interest in your judgment.

197
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:23,470
Miss Ives is manifesting a deep
psychosexual responsiveness.

198
00:13:23,504 --> 00:13:25,840
I would say the root of
her condition lies there.

199
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,975
In guilt.

200
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,712
Something or someone has triggered it.

201
00:13:31,746 --> 00:13:34,914
Well, last night she
went out with a young man.

202
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:36,400
All right.

203
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,985
Let's imagine this.

204
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:40,554
She has an erotic encounter with this man.

205
00:13:40,588 --> 00:13:41,688
Perhaps her first, we don't know.

206
00:13:41,723 --> 00:13:44,057
And it evolves into some
sort of sexual extremity

207
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:47,927
or perversity that produces
feelings of guilt or shame.

208
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,297
That might stimulate a psychological break

209
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,766
or dissociation which...

210
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,180
Did you bring your weapons?

211
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,881
- Yes.
- Come.

212
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:13,209
My God.

213
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,739
Mr. Chandler.

214
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,993
Forgive me. I am not myself.

215
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,397
My dear Miss Ives.

216
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,835
Can I help you in any way?

217
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,138
You have no idea how I fight this thing,

218
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,239
but it is...

219
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:46,642
adamantine.

220
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,646
What thing?

221
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,883
This thing inside me.

222
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:15,337
No one has taken my hand
so sweetly for many years.

223
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:28,850
May I ask you a question, Mr. Chandler?

224
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,618
Of course.

225
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:38,926
Did you fuck him or did he fuck you?

226
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:41,963
The beautiful boy of our dreams.

227
00:16:41,997 --> 00:16:43,231
The irresistible one.

228
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:44,998
You know who I mean.

229
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,654
He fucked you, didn't he?

230
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:59,980
Goddamn, did you enjoy it?

231
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,218
I think we'll tell Brona.

232
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,554
Yeah.

233
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:10,357
We'll tell Brona.

234
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:12,592
Of course,

235
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,128
she already knows the boy.

236
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:17,397
Didn't she tell ya?

237
00:17:17,432 --> 00:17:19,199
Oh, I'm so sorry.

238
00:17:19,233 --> 00:17:21,901
He fucked her while she bled.

239
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:23,369
I don't need to tell you

240
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:25,705
how much she enjoyed it.

241
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,907
Ask her to show you the pictures.

242
00:17:27,942 --> 00:17:29,491
The sedative, Doctor.

243
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:31,478
Ah.

244
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:34,280
Is the child killer back for more?

245
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,716
No sons for you to kill here, Malcolm!

246
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,785
Help me! Help me.

247
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:41,820
Keep your hands off me, virgin doctor!

248
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:42,955
Restrain her!

249
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,160
Leave her!

250
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:49,895
You imbeciles!

251
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:51,297
Leave her to me!

252
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,399
You men, you men, you men!

253
00:18:23,095 --> 00:18:24,562
What's wrong with her?

254
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:26,697
She's been possessed by the Devil.

255
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,401
Oh, fuck me.

256
00:18:30,435 --> 00:18:32,336
Or a devil. Who can say?

257
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,672
There is a pantheon I believe.

258
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,374
Well, you're a doctor. Do something!

259
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:40,077
This is a bit beyond my usual practice.

260
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:42,279
There is, I believe, a
larger plan at work here.

261
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:45,382
Something beyond even the
monstrousness we have witnessed.

262
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,552
I spoke to an Egyptologist

263
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,287
who suggested the creature we seek

264
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:54,491
might believe Miss Ives to be an
incarnation of the goddess Amunet.

265
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,262
Should that creature take hold of her

266
00:18:58,296 --> 00:19:01,264
it would unleash untold horrors.

267
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,302
For Christ's sake, we
gotta get her a priest.

268
00:19:06,336 --> 00:19:07,704
Don't be insulting.

269
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:10,206
Might as well call a witch
doctor or an old gypsy woman.

270
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,608
Shut the fuck up.

271
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,377
No priest. We cannot bring
anyone else into this.

272
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,013
So what's the plan?

273
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:20,015
We keep her alive while
she fights this thing.

274
00:19:21,418 --> 00:19:24,120
We show her she is not alone.

275
00:19:24,154 --> 00:19:26,322
Remember what you said to me?

276
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:30,058
"At the end of the day, the only thing
we really have is the people we trust."

277
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:34,129
She trusts us.

278
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:43,505
Will you stay and help us?

279
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,275
You know I will.

280
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:55,217
Did you understand the
words she said to me?

281
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:56,585
It was Arabic.

282
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,920
She said, "Let me die."

283
00:21:50,196 --> 00:21:51,862
Mr. Chandler.

284
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,033
Miss Ives.

285
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:58,036
You're awake.

286
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,904
So it would seem.

287
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:04,174
How long have I been asleep?

288
00:22:05,176 --> 00:22:07,144
A week more or less.

289
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:12,617
Though you do wake up and
get feisty every now and then.

290
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:15,686
I can only imagine.

291
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,357
Is there water?

292
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:38,574
I'm not going to hurt you.

293
00:22:40,844 --> 00:22:42,845
It gets pretty rough sometimes.

294
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:48,285
Our friend, the doctor, thinks
we might have to restrain you

295
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:50,720
to keep you from hurting yourself.

296
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,672
He would, wouldn't he?

297
00:23:01,064 --> 00:23:02,098
You don't know what it's like

298
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,233
having this thing inside me.

299
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,035
Always...

300
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,769
scratching.

301
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:12,641
That's an awful word, but
that's what it feels like.

302
00:23:12,676 --> 00:23:16,545
An animal scratching to get out.

303
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,764
Should we get you a priest?

304
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:22,184
Someone to talk to? Would that help?

305
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,920
I don't know,

306
00:23:24,954 --> 00:23:27,255
I've fallen from the faith.

307
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:32,194
But, yes. Yes.

308
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,101
Then we will.

309
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,407
I don't remember what happens really,

310
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,794
but some things I do.

311
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:53,163
You've been kind.

312
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,750
Everybody.

313
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,484
Not like you.

314
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:03,824
I might have fallen in love with you.

315
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,110
You don't mind me saying that?

316
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,063
You still might.

317
00:24:11,532 --> 00:24:13,717
Don't let me hurt anyone.

318
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:16,335
I won't.

319
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:18,071
They won't stop me.

320
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,106
They haven't the heart for it.

321
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,808
But you do.

322
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:28,581
When the moment comes, look into my eyes,

323
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,818
and pull the trigger.

324
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:37,390
And send you to heaven?

325
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,525
If you believe in that.

326
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:41,026
Oh, I do.

327
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:47,567
But I believe in the other place more.

328
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:53,471
'Course, I know that place pretty well.

329
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,411
You might say it's where I was flung

330
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:03,415
when your fucking cunt
of a God cast me out.

331
00:25:05,084 --> 00:25:07,518
You don't recognize
your old friend, Vanessa?

332
00:25:14,193 --> 00:25:15,527
So it's this game again?

333
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,095
I thought you liked games.

334
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,131
You certainly did with Mr. Gray.

335
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:21,333
Am I meant to give you a name again?

336
00:25:21,367 --> 00:25:22,901
Is it Satan now?

337
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:26,003
Or do you fashion yourself
Lucifer, the Fallen Angel?

338
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,338
That's how you fashion me.

339
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,206
How pitiable you are!

340
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,810
Forever hiding your face
in the guise of others.

341
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,077
Are you afraid?

342
00:25:35,514 --> 00:25:37,048
Always.

343
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:42,853
But do you know what I fear most of all?

344
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:46,823
A life thwarted.

345
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:51,329
Greatness promised, but never achieved.

346
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:53,965
If your goal is to have
me surrender to you,

347
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,166
that day will never come.

348
00:25:57,034 --> 00:25:59,035
I could kill you.

349
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,904
Choke out your life.

350
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,073
Seize up the heart.

351
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:08,979
Then do it!

352
00:26:11,949 --> 00:26:13,816
You can't resist me forever, darlin'.

353
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,952
But I can... now.

354
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:23,993
Say I kill them downstairs.

355
00:26:25,363 --> 00:26:26,696
Do it!

356
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,064
My soul remains my own.

357
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:32,334
Tell me what you want of me
right now. No more evasions.

358
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:37,356
I want you to be the mother of evil.

359
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,379
I want you to rule the darkness with me.

360
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:45,146
At my side.

361
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,982
Looking over a black,

362
00:26:48,518 --> 00:26:50,952
scorched, dead world.

363
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:53,489
Where there is no more pain,

364
00:26:53,523 --> 00:26:56,558
because there are no more hearts to feel.

365
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,594
We have eaten them all, thee and me.

366
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:02,963
And together we will conquer God.

367
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:06,684
Topple him from his bloody throne,

368
00:27:07,537 --> 00:27:09,654
and rule in his stead.

369
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,041
Everlasting.

370
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,998
Darkling,

371
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,769
listen.

372
00:28:28,031 --> 00:28:29,798
Have you thought about my offer?

373
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:31,733
Coming to Africa?

374
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,635
Don't need the glory.

375
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,206
Don't underestimate the value of prestige.

376
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,241
For Christ's sake! What
are you trying to prove?

377
00:28:40,276 --> 00:28:41,810
That you're still young?

378
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:44,112
That you're still relevant?

379
00:28:44,146 --> 00:28:45,547
Or are you just running away again?

380
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:47,549
Something you know intimately.

381
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,217
- Don't.
- Getting angry?

382
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:50,452
Fuck you!

383
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:52,554
That mysterious past of yours.

384
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:53,989
How far can you run?

385
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,724
You know what, I have a father!
I don't need another one!

386
00:28:55,758 --> 00:28:57,325
And you had a son and you killed him.

387
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:59,359
Am I missing anything?

388
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:10,104
Lord, are we ever
getting out of this house?

389
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,639
Do you know why I must go to Africa?

390
00:29:12,673 --> 00:29:14,341
I don't care.

391
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:17,010
Yes, you do.

392
00:29:17,778 --> 00:29:20,113
I buried my son Peter

393
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:22,448
on the shores of Lake Tanganyika.

394
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,352
He was like a skeleton.

395
00:29:28,089 --> 00:29:31,124
The insects had gotten to him.

396
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,362
I carried him to the grave and put him in.

397
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:40,299
He weighed practically nothing.

398
00:29:42,236 --> 00:29:44,236
And then I left,

399
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,974
because I still had to survey
the northern end of the lake

400
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:50,743
to ascertain if any of the outlets

401
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:53,178
might be the source of the Nile.

402
00:29:53,212 --> 00:29:56,948
It's a fever, this Nile
quest, as I told you.

403
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:03,521
I am returning to bring my son's body home.

404
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:05,907
At least that's what you tell yourself.

405
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:08,009
Yes, that's what I tell myself.

406
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:09,861
You're not that good.

407
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,948
I know.

408
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,797
We must restrain her
or she'll kill herself.

409
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,467
Don't let me hurt you! Please! Quickly!

410
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,314
Morphine?

411
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,183
Yep.

412
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:26,051
Is it an addiction?

413
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,620
Yes.

414
00:31:28,654 --> 00:31:30,289
Caused by what?

415
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,292
Pain.

416
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:45,469
My turn upstairs.

417
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,463
How is she?

418
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,735
Sleeping, I think.

419
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,303
Good.

420
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,106
The best thing.

421
00:32:58,275 --> 00:33:00,009
And for you, too.

422
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,846
So what the hell do we do now?

423
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,648
I'm going to try a
transfusion in the morning,

424
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,917
some vitamins, essential proteins.

425
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,821
That'll keep her alive to fight on anyway.

426
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,791
"Fight on."

427
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:18,660
But for all our efforts,
we may have to let her go.

428
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:20,713
Go where?

429
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,536
Do you believe in God?

430
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,137
No.

431
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,426
I wish I did.

432
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:42,583
I believe in everything but God.

433
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,852
I have to tell you something,

434
00:33:48,891 --> 00:33:51,759
I'm not sure Sir Malcolm
is being honest with us.

435
00:33:54,296 --> 00:33:56,564
- About what?
- Miss Ives.

436
00:33:56,598 --> 00:33:57,698
I know he doesn't want her to die,

437
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:00,635
but I'm not quite sure
why he wants her to live.

438
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:02,286
He cares for her.

439
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,940
She's like a daughter.

440
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:07,858
No. She's not.

441
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:10,210
That's the problem.

442
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:17,116
You know the saddest thing I ever saw?

443
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:20,387
When the army pacifies a native tribe,

444
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:22,989
they take the children away.

445
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,792
They cut off their hair,

446
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:29,329
which is a source of spiritual
strength to them, you see.

447
00:34:31,065 --> 00:34:33,599
They take away their medicine bags,

448
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,070
they give them new names.

449
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:39,305
John Smith. William Sherman.

450
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,911
Then they ship them
East to boarding school.

451
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:46,546
Awful.

452
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,481
That's not the worst.

453
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:52,751
Sometimes a John Smith or
William Sherman would escape

454
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,421
and make it back to their home tribe.

455
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,459
Well, they've forgotten their language,

456
00:35:01,761 --> 00:35:03,395
their stories.

457
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,600
They are unwelcome.

458
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:11,469
So what do they do?

459
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,839
They don't fit in either world.

460
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:16,675
Like Miss Ives?

461
00:35:18,478 --> 00:35:20,111
Like Miss Ives.

462
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:24,015
So what do they do?

463
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:28,119
They roam and they die.

464
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,108
Oh, it's snowing.

465
00:36:03,355 --> 00:36:05,389
Can I ask you a favor?

466
00:36:12,263 --> 00:36:13,797
It's heavier than you thought.

467
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:15,699
You'll get used to that.

468
00:36:15,733 --> 00:36:17,333
The trick is not pulling the barrel up

469
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:20,270
when you're aiming because of the weight.

470
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,339
Point the gun down,

471
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:28,578
and carefully pull back the
hammer with your other hand.

472
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:35,251
So lethal.

473
00:36:35,286 --> 00:36:37,887
You'll get used to that too.

474
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:40,122
Now raise the gun and point it down there.

475
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:44,860
Now put your finger on
the trigger very gently,

476
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:47,462
like you're touching a lady's neck.

477
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:54,903
Well, like surgery, then.

478
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,007
Now this is going to be very loud.

479
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:00,075
When I tell you,

480
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:04,079
I want you to take an easy
breath out and then an inhale.

481
00:37:04,113 --> 00:37:06,014
At the top of the inhale,

482
00:37:06,048 --> 00:37:08,016
I want you to gently squeeze the trigger.

483
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,885
Don't jerk it, just gently squeeze.

484
00:37:12,655 --> 00:37:13,988
Easy exhale...

485
00:37:15,424 --> 00:37:16,557
and inhale.

486
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,194
Fire.

487
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,895
All right!

488
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,663
Again?

489
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,499
Go crazy, Dr. F.

490
00:37:32,207 --> 00:37:34,341
Take it easy, Annie Oakley.

491
00:37:34,676 --> 00:37:36,076
You do it.

492
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,112
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Go on.

493
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:39,480
Look, I was a professional sharpshooter.

494
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,515
You know you want to.

495
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:49,022
Whoo!

496
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,859
What about a rifle? Do you have a rifle?

497
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:58,866
Sir Malcolm is inquiring about the noise.

498
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,434
Uh-oh. We're in trouble with Dad.

499
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:08,932
This is good.

500
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:19,108
I picked up the rudiments of cooking

501
00:39:19,143 --> 00:39:21,011
on the trail back home.

502
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,649
Always thought myself a
dab hand at the spices.

503
00:39:28,986 --> 00:39:30,420
In America, yes?

504
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,622
New Mexico Territory mostly.

505
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,158
But all over really.

506
00:39:36,426 --> 00:39:40,229
California, all the way to the Pacific.

507
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,768
When I first saw the ocean,

508
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:49,072
I thought it must be a lake.

509
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,507
Nothing could be so large.

510
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:55,577
Not even the Mountains of the Moon.

511
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,199
So, what's your story?

512
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,117
I have no story.

513
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:03,786
Is that so?

514
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,888
Looking at you, here in London,

515
00:40:09,425 --> 00:40:11,459
I would think you have a story.

516
00:40:11,794 --> 00:40:13,027
No.

517
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:15,196
I have a theory.

518
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:18,967
I think Sir Malcolm saved your life

519
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,852
and you owe him.

520
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,904
That's why you're here.

521
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:27,308
Or I saved his and now
he is my responsibility.

522
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,277
Guess it comes down to much the same thing.

523
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,182
We all owe each other in the end.

524
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,652
Like her.

525
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,088
Like her.

526
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,659
You should call a priest.

527
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,230
Do you believe in God?

528
00:40:50,632 --> 00:40:53,299
I believe in everything.

529
00:41:38,111 --> 00:41:40,212
Vanessa, can you hear me?

530
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,917
Vanessa...

531
00:41:51,824 --> 00:41:53,742
Vanessa, can you hear me?

532
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:57,195
Yes.

533
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:02,266
I know you're very tired and
that you just want to sleep,

534
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,302
but I think you can help us.

535
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,573
You're now in a very special place.

536
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:12,410
Between our world and another,

537
00:42:12,444 --> 00:42:15,413
perhaps between life and death itself.

538
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:18,982
As is our Mina.

539
00:42:20,051 --> 00:42:21,786
You must be close to her.

540
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:25,923
Reach out to her.

541
00:42:27,126 --> 00:42:28,659
Find her.

542
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:33,664
Don't...

543
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:36,299
You must. We might never
have this chance again.

544
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:39,603
All of this...

545
00:42:39,638 --> 00:42:42,139
All of this... You wanted it.

546
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,207
No.

547
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,010
You allowed it to continue.

548
00:42:46,044 --> 00:42:47,978
Please, just try.

549
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,188
How cruel you are.

550
00:43:11,101 --> 00:43:12,568
Find her.

551
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:23,045
Get the fuck away from her.

552
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:30,819
Whatever game you think
you're playing I've had enough!

553
00:43:30,853 --> 00:43:32,188
We need to end this.

554
00:43:32,222 --> 00:43:33,955
- Ethan, hold on.
- We have to get her a priest.

555
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,357
Tonight. Right now!

556
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:36,792
We can bring no one else into this.

557
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:38,093
What might she do to them?

558
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:40,429
- Like that?
- You know she is not always like that.

559
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:41,863
She is dying.

560
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:43,098
The battle's over. We lost.

561
00:43:43,132 --> 00:43:45,133
Or it won. Who gives a fuck?

562
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:47,035
It's time to do what she wants.

563
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,536
She wants to die.

564
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:50,238
Then let her.

565
00:43:50,973 --> 00:43:53,742
You mean a priest for the last rites?

566
00:43:53,776 --> 00:43:55,010
Yes.

567
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:57,545
Or for the ritual of exorcism.

568
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,846
Stop it!

569
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,782
She's a Catholic. If she
believes in it, it might help her!

570
00:44:01,817 --> 00:44:03,851
Have you not a single
shred of decency left?

571
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,353
You know nothing!

572
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:07,521
Is that what happens when you
murder your way across a continent?

573
00:44:08,457 --> 00:44:09,724
Stop it!

574
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:11,226
Stop it!

575
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,728
You've got a girl dying in there.

576
00:44:13,762 --> 00:44:16,764
Not some monster with fangs.

577
00:44:16,798 --> 00:44:19,633
You want a daughter? There she is.

578
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,378
Get the priest.

579
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:37,917
Sir Malcolm, I swear to Christ

580
00:44:38,253 --> 00:44:40,454
if she's right,

581
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:43,389
if you let all this happen so
that you could manipulate her,

582
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:46,392
I'll rip your throat out.

583
00:45:30,236 --> 00:45:32,971
Will you give me something?

584
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:36,691
- What?
- To stay awake.

585
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:55,526
This is a cocaine derivative.

586
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,829
They used to give it to me as a child.

587
00:45:59,097 --> 00:46:00,264
I had asthma.

588
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,899
Did it work?

589
00:46:01,934 --> 00:46:03,134
Yes.

590
00:46:04,937 --> 00:46:08,672
But it left a taste for narcotics.

591
00:46:10,107 --> 00:46:12,575
The manipulation of the
body through science.

592
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:16,513
In Africa I was famous for eschewing drugs.

593
00:46:16,548 --> 00:46:18,749
Form of weakness, I thought.

594
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,120
My son died there because
we lost our medicine,

595
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:25,188
or the porters ran off with it,

596
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:26,957
I don't remember.

597
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:33,095
God, I honestly don't remember.

598
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:39,236
I left him at base camp and went off.

599
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,470
When I returned, he was dead.

600
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:47,877
He had asked me to name
a mountain after him.

601
00:46:49,713 --> 00:46:51,814
The Murray Mountains in the Congo.

602
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:55,518
When the time came to claim the range,

603
00:46:55,552 --> 00:46:58,688
and affix a proper English
name to it, I mean...

604
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,593
I wasn't thinking of him.

605
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:08,863
I named it for myself.

606
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:15,504
No, Doctor.

607
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:19,740
I haven't a shred of decency left.

608
00:47:36,158 --> 00:47:37,391
Thank you.

609
00:47:39,395 --> 00:47:42,196
Father Matthews, Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

610
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:44,232
- Doctor.
- Father.

611
00:47:44,266 --> 00:47:45,533
Thank you for coming.

612
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,835
It is a duty to which I am accustomed.

613
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,369
Um, where is the woman?

614
00:47:49,404 --> 00:47:51,071
Before we go up, there's
more we should tell you.

615
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,306
Come this way, please.

616
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,874
Uh, Sir Malcolm, with respect,

617
00:47:53,909 --> 00:47:56,677
I need only know if she's been
through the sacrament of baptism

618
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:59,680
and is in good standing
with the Holy Church of Rome.

619
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:01,114
And thereby hangs a tale.

620
00:48:01,149 --> 00:48:03,116
Uh, it's rather more complicated than that.

621
00:48:03,151 --> 00:48:04,618
We believe...

622
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:07,921
have cause to believe

623
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:11,591
that she is being
controlled by another force,

624
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:14,127
a power beyond our understanding.

625
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:16,661
It's our hope that you might be able

626
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:18,898
to make progress where we have failed.

627
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:22,702
You are talking about
the ritual of exorcism?

628
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:24,270
Yes.

629
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:27,173
It's forbidden by canon law

630
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:30,142
without the express permission
from the Church of Rome.

631
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,911
It will not be forthcoming.

632
00:48:31,946 --> 00:48:33,045
Meet her at least.

633
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,714
I can deliver extreme unction,

634
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:36,048
I can hear her confession

635
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:38,084
and I can administer the last rites.

636
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,052
More than that is impossible.

637
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:41,320
Give her the last rites

638
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:44,122
and get the fuck out of this
house, you ridiculous man.

639
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,330
I will do my duty and nothing more.

640
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,000
Come this way.

641
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,988
Do what you're here for.

642
00:49:54,391 --> 00:49:55,858
Get him a chair.

643
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:32,194
Do you understand my words?

644
00:50:53,015 --> 00:50:54,848
Are you a Roman Catholic?

645
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,686
Do you follow the teachings of Mother Rome

646
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:01,688
and her ministers on Earth?

647
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:08,828
What's her name?

648
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:10,297
Vanessa.

649
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,403
My name is Father Matthews.

650
00:51:17,438 --> 00:51:20,040
Do you know why I'm here, Vanessa?

651
00:51:23,077 --> 00:51:27,713
You were baptized and
confirmed in the Church of Rome?

652
00:51:29,883 --> 00:51:32,818
Are you prepared to take extreme unction

653
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:35,254
and to make your confession?

654
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:39,124
I knew.

655
00:51:39,493 --> 00:51:42,261
I knew a Matthew.

656
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,532
Dr. Christopher Matthew Banning.

657
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:50,702
He tortured me with water too.

658
00:51:51,805 --> 00:51:55,141
I... I knew another Matthew.

659
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:57,342
In the ancient days.

660
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,746
He was a tax collector.

661
00:52:00,781 --> 00:52:04,315
He died near Hierapolis.

662
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:07,752
It was very hot and sunny.

663
00:52:07,787 --> 00:52:10,755
I nailed him on the sticks upside down

664
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,225
so he would come to me faster,

665
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:14,926
so he would see it.

666
00:52:36,014 --> 00:52:37,448
Get him out!

667
00:52:38,684 --> 00:52:39,950
Get him out!

668
00:52:44,189 --> 00:52:47,692
Get him out! Get him out!

669
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:01,371
Vanessa...

670
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,574
I know you're still there.

671
00:53:06,211 --> 00:53:08,262
I'm not gonna leave you.

672
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:12,214
Vanessa.

673
00:53:16,053 --> 00:53:18,154
Vanessa, please!

674
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,874
I beg you.

675
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:40,943
Now.

676
00:53:44,147 --> 00:53:45,547
Please.

677
00:53:48,451 --> 00:53:49,952
Please.

678
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:56,291
I beg you...

679
00:53:57,827 --> 00:53:59,194
Do it.

680
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,155
There cannot be a happy end,

681
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:24,460
for claw will slash and tooth will rend.

682
00:57:24,494 --> 00:57:26,061
There cannot be a happy end...

683
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,732
for claw will slash and tooth will rend.

684
00:57:30,766 --> 00:57:32,701
There cannot be a happy end,

685
00:57:32,735 --> 00:57:36,070
for claw will slash and tooth will rend.

686
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:38,507
There cannot be a happy end,

687
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:41,342
for claw will slash and tooth will rend.

688
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,960
You should be in bed.

689
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:03,163
I know where Mina is.
