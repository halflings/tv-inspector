1
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,418
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

2
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:10,952
Her gifts make her vulnerable.

3
00:00:10,986 --> 00:00:13,321
They also make her desirable.

4
00:00:13,356 --> 00:00:14,423
Vanessa...

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:16,658
Help me.

6
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:17,759
What happened to Mina?

7
00:00:17,793 --> 00:00:19,561
She became embroiled with a creature.

8
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:21,095
Now she has become his slave,

9
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,197
hovering between our world and his.

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,699
They are all about me.

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,400
And what's your part in all this?

12
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:27,802
My part is my own.

13
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:29,437
I lost a son in Africa.

14
00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:31,673
Father mine, let me come with you.

15
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:33,741
I'll prove myself a proper explorer.

16
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:35,577
Peter loves you, Father.

17
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,845
Amunet, girl?

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,815
No, much older.

19
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:45,086
Amunet was the consort of Amun-Ra,

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,121
the original serpent prince.

21
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:48,822
He was sustained by feeding

22
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:50,291
on the souls of others.

23
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:52,126
I would not tell Miss Ives this.

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,260
Who wants to know they're
hunted by the devil?

25
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:56,429
What's happened?

26
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:57,530
It came after you.

27
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:58,899
I think it was all a ploy.

28
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,634
But it was Mina who led me to him.

29
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:02,202
That she may be your enemy.

30
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,369
Can you blame her?

31
00:01:03,404 --> 00:01:04,537
Where's Vanessa?

32
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:05,872
I want Mother.

33
00:01:05,907 --> 00:01:07,074
Why do you want her?

34
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,709
Why does everyone want her?

35
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,012
But for my transgression,
would any of this have occurred?

36
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,148
We cannot unmake the past.

37
00:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,550
We shall live with our guilt, you and I.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000

39
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,584
My dearest Mina,

40
00:03:00,618 --> 00:03:02,385
my darling friend.

41
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:08,156
I began these letters when
I recovered from my illness.

42
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,192
At first, I composed
them perhaps every month.

43
00:03:12,028 --> 00:03:14,830
Then weekly and now daily.

44
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:18,434
Soon I will, no doubt,
give up all other occupation

45
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,402
and simply write.

46
00:03:20,437 --> 00:03:23,705
The ending of one letter becoming
the beginning of the next,

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,141
an endless ribbon of words.

48
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,152
I write in hope that one
day you will answer me

49
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:39,954
and that everything can
again be like it was...

50
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,959
Though I know that can never be.

51
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,105
I don't remember clouds when we were young.

52
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,142
Were there any, my dearest Mina?

53
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:03,878
Just beyond the horizon, perhaps?

54
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,847
Or was it all seashore and sandcastles?

55
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:09,016
Such a thought is naive, I know.

56
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,218
But aren't memories always that?

57
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:14,220
Let's go in and go terribly far out.

58
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,757
We mustn't. We'll get in trouble.

59
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,258
You're afraid.

60
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:21,461
No, I'm not. Then come in with me.

61
00:04:21,496 --> 00:04:23,229
How far do you think we could swim?

62
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,500
Far as we want. Everywhere.

63
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:28,168
And what would we do when we got there?

64
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:29,502
Everything.

65
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:33,339
I think we should go in and
go as far out as we can see.

66
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:36,075
No, we shouldn't.

67
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,044
Will you always be afraid, Mina mine?

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:03,001
Were ever two families closer than ours?

69
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:07,206
I don't remember a day that gate
between our homes was closed.

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,724
Until the day it closed forever.

71
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,358
Hello, Mrs. Murray. Gorgeous
day for the homecoming.

72
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,092
We're all at sixes and sevens.

73
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:30,061
Children are in the solarium.

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,351
Good morning, Mr. Andrews.

75
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:41,738
Good morning.

76
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,543
Good morning.

77
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:49,230
Good morning, Peter.

78
00:05:50,882 --> 00:05:52,649
God, still at that monkey?

79
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,951
As much as I try, it just looks...

80
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:56,553
- Dead.
- He's not an "it,"

81
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:57,755
he's a "he."

82
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:58,955
Give him a name.

83
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,024
Van, he's a stupid dead monkey.

84
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:02,626
You have to give them names

85
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,895
or they'll never come to life.

86
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,931
It's like a witch's spell.

87
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:14,905
This is Ariel from the Shakespeare.

88
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,208
You're forever working on
things that eat other things.

89
00:06:18,242 --> 00:06:20,210
I think you're bloodthirsty.

90
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:23,013
I'm bloodthirsty. She's just ghoulish.

91
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:26,849
I think Mr. Andrews has the
most luxurious mustaches.

92
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,552
- I know, he's gorgeous.
- And so tall.

93
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,589
I'm sure I'll marry a tall man.

94
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:35,725
I couldn't love someone stunted,

95
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,560
it'd be too embarrassing at balls.

96
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:39,829
- What sort of man will he be?
- Hmm...

97
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,496
Over 6 feet at least.

98
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,899
With mustaches he waxes daily

99
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:45,734
and tiny feet for dancing.

100
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:47,903
What about you?

101
00:06:47,938 --> 00:06:49,871
Anything but one of
father's dreadful solicitors.

102
00:06:51,808 --> 00:06:54,409
Then, of course, you're
going to marry Peter.

103
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,479
Everyone says so.

104
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,481
I shan't be here to marry you, Van.

105
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:00,982
Where will you be?

106
00:07:01,016 --> 00:07:02,717
In Africa with father.

107
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:05,053
Are you sure you want to be an explorer?

108
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:07,489
Well, I can't be making
stuffed monkeys my whole life.

109
00:07:19,601 --> 00:07:22,170
Be careful with those bags.

110
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,425
- Father!
- Hello, Peter.

111
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,077
Father!

112
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,878
And there's my girl.

113
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,580
Hello!

114
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,682
You're so thin.

115
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,650
I can feel your ribs this time.

116
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,051
And you haven't worn your hat.

117
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,353
Oh, you've caught me out.

118
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:41,589
That was the first thing I lost.

119
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,223
- What was the second?
- My way.

120
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,212
Hello, Gladys.

121
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:55,919
None of that, dear.

122
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,339
What did you bring me?

123
00:08:00,608 --> 00:08:02,642
Well, let's see...

124
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,810
What have we got here?

125
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,512
Now...

126
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:09,649
Ugh.

127
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:11,885
- What is it?
- It's a serval.

128
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,254
Genus Leptailurus from the
shores of Lake Tanganyika.

129
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,789
- How gorgeous.
- Thank you, Father.

130
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,392
Now, I'm as hungry as a crocodile.

131
00:08:20,827 --> 00:08:22,861
Have you put on a proper feast?

132
00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:40,812
Excuse me?

133
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:44,082
Those festive homecomings I remember most.

134
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,283
They were our true holidays.

135
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,656
My mother and father were always
welcome company at your table.

136
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:57,362
Your father would return to us
with rare gifts and a sunburn.

137
00:08:57,396 --> 00:09:01,032
Now, would anyone like to hear about
my encounter with the cannibals?

138
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,201
Yes? Good.

139
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:06,171
But rarest of all were
his tales of adventure,

140
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:08,206
I'm sure much edited for our ears.

141
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,407
...when we suddenly heard a cry...

142
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,110
Nyame.

143
00:09:13,144 --> 00:09:15,046
Peter's eyes would light up.

144
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,849
Such a marvelous future he
imagined alongside his father.

145
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,685
Before we knew it we were tangled up

146
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:23,520
in ropes and nets, and there they were.

147
00:09:23,555 --> 00:09:29,059
Shouting, waving their spears,
chanting, "Nyame! Nyame! Nyame!"

148
00:09:29,094 --> 00:09:31,728
- Nyame means "meat."
- Oh!

149
00:09:31,762 --> 00:09:35,565
Flesh. Food. Us.

150
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:38,502
That's just awful.

151
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:46,142
Shall we begin?

152
00:09:46,176 --> 00:09:49,079
But for all our kinship, my Mina,

153
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:51,214
we were not completely alike.

154
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:53,049
The mysteries of my Catholic church

155
00:09:53,084 --> 00:09:55,318
were alien to you and your family.

156
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:59,922
Had I been older, I would have seen more.

157
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,857
Beneath the laughter,

158
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:06,061
beneath that great, easy
outpouring of conversation,

159
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:08,731
it wasn't tension exactly, was it?

160
00:10:08,765 --> 00:10:11,800
Not amongst two such congenial families.

161
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,437
No.

162
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:16,939
It was more a tremor of something.

163
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:19,808
Like words hollered down a bottomless pit

164
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:23,278
that come back occluded and more complex.

165
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,847
Adulthood, maybe.

166
00:10:36,925 --> 00:10:41,530
And on that terrible night,
that night it happened,

167
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:44,832
did anything particularly
important happen at the dinner?

168
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,602
No, not that I recall.

169
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,047
Honestly, I thought I was going to find
you and Peter around the next corner,

170
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,715
playing some trick on me.

171
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,661
My mother.

172
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:16,930
Your father.

173
00:11:18,966 --> 00:11:20,668
More than the shock,

174
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:23,836
the sinfulness, the forbidden act,

175
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,638
there was this.

176
00:11:26,908 --> 00:11:28,641
I enjoyed it.

177
00:11:31,746 --> 00:11:33,747
Something whispered.

178
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,181
I listened.

179
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,589
Perhaps it has always
been there, this thing,

180
00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,326
this demon inside me.

181
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,061
Or behind my back, waiting
for me to turn around.

182
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,811
I didn't tell you what I saw.

183
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:07,679
How could I?

184
00:12:09,182 --> 00:12:11,816
There was no need for
you to grow up so fast.

185
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,218
- Tomorrow, we should go into town.
- Yes.

186
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:19,891
You could not have endured
it. Or so I told myself.

187
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:24,095
Perhaps I was just cherishing
the secrecy of it as a hidden sin.

188
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:27,799
But in me, there was a change.

189
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,634
I marked it from that
night in the hedge maze.

190
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,956
Perhaps it was always there.

191
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,480
Little acts of wickedness.

192
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:45,916
Harmless, of course.
Something any girl would do.

193
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,969
I told myself it was no more than mischief.

194
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,689
But I knew it was more.

195
00:12:51,723 --> 00:12:53,190
Of course I did.

196
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,739
♪ Cold blows the wind ♪

197
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:12,309
♪ To my true love ♪

198
00:13:12,343 --> 00:13:16,429
♪ And gently drops the rain ♪

199
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:23,720
♪ I have never had but one true love ♪

200
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:28,658
♪ And in Greenwood he lies slain ♪

201
00:13:28,693 --> 00:13:31,361
And as we grew up, and you grew lovelier,

202
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:34,931
it was no wonder to me that
you met your gentleman first.

203
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,934
Or that he had luxurious mustaches.

204
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:40,736
Such a gallant young officer.

205
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,905
What a handsome couple you were.

206
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,641
Found you.

207
00:13:51,481 --> 00:13:52,581
Thank you.

208
00:13:54,951 --> 00:13:58,687
It was the season of
Peter's inadequate beard,

209
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:02,691
I watched your courtship
with Captain Branson flourish.

210
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:05,693
All the stratagems of advance and retreat.

211
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:09,931
I always thought of
myself as the stronger one.

212
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:12,467
But here, you were so valiant.

213
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,685
How could he not be conquered?

214
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,474
I think you set your future at that table.

215
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:23,310
He spoke of India and
suddenly I saw you going.

216
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:25,346
When would I see you again?

217
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:28,249
Isn't India so terribly far away?

218
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:30,618
What would I do?

219
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:32,152
Marry Peter?

220
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,491
God, how I envied you.

221
00:14:39,995 --> 00:14:41,961
Perhaps I even hated you.

222
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:50,437
How was it possible that you,
always so meek and obliging,

223
00:14:50,471 --> 00:14:53,673
were to have this greatest
of adventures before me?

224
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:57,043
You would know love, you
would know a man's touch,

225
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:00,980
while I, the courageous
one, knew nothing of life.

226
00:15:02,784 --> 00:15:04,117
Mina, my dear.

227
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:21,000
Of course, he's a fine
man. I've no doubt of that.

228
00:15:21,035 --> 00:15:23,403
He'll make a proper husband.

229
00:15:23,437 --> 00:15:24,971
But I hate to think of her out in India

230
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:28,241
with all that heat and those filthy wogs.

231
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,409
What do you think Africa will be like?

232
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:33,345
Oh, God, Van. Don't mention that.

233
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:37,282
Every time I try and talk with
father about it, he shies away.

234
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,753
Maybe you shouldn't ask anymore.

235
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,972
It's all I've ever dreamed
about. You know that.

236
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,525
My father and I off on an adventure,

237
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,978
blazing some daring new trail.

238
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,165
Perhaps...

239
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,533
What?

240
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:59,204
Perhaps then, I wouldn't be
such a disappointment to him.

241
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,274
I was never the son he wanted.

242
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:05,944
Always ill, never good at games.

243
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,114
A disappointment.

244
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,183
He needed someone more like...

245
00:16:13,218 --> 00:16:14,552
Me?

246
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,057
You'll be all alone when I go.

247
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,610
Mina in India, me with Father.

248
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,563
That'll be sad for you.

249
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:27,998
But I suppose...

250
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:47,484
The minister's coming at seven
and mother wants us there.

251
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,737
You know how she is about time.

252
00:16:59,296 --> 00:17:01,231
If I could only go back now,

253
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:02,965
I would run after him and say,

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,767
"Don't go. Don't go to Africa.

255
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,170
"You'll never survive, you're too weak.

256
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:08,938
"You're beautifully weak, Peter.

257
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:11,641
"I love you for your weakness."

258
00:17:11,675 --> 00:17:16,812
For at that moment, Mina, I
saw the future crystal clear.

259
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:35,096
I tried to pray that
night. God didn't answer me.

260
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,466
But another did.

261
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,769
Soon, child.

262
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:46,507
What games we will have.

263
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:21,274
You were never happier than that weekend.

264
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,094
On the following morning
you would be married.

265
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,280
One more night as Miss Mina Murray

266
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,750
before you became Mrs. Charles Branson.

267
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,118
All right.

268
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,585
Bye-bye.

269
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:37,791
You didn't seem to mind this loss of self.

270
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:42,929
Perhaps I minded it for you.

271
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:22,250
You've found me out.

272
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,437
Last night of freedom, eh?

273
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:32,194
Would you like to see
something interesting?

274
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,495
No.

275
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:52,797
My Mina?

276
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:54,598
Your Mina.

277
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:56,600
Although you'll be relieved to know

278
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,853
she only worked with the
most pacific of animals.

279
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:03,340
This is her squirrel.

280
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,427
Which are yours?

281
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:08,212
Not the docile ones.

282
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:10,346
That doesn't surprise me.

283
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,955
I've always felt you have to name a thing

284
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:20,724
before it comes to life,

285
00:20:21,526 --> 00:20:23,459
like a witch's spell.

286
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:26,445
His name is Ariel.

287
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,307
The most challenging bit is the eyes.

288
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:40,810
They're glass, of course,

289
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:43,311
so by nature are dead and dull.

290
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,616
But that wouldn't do for my great predator.

291
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,686
So I put mirrors behind the
glass eyes, so they would spark.

292
00:20:52,989 --> 00:20:54,323
You see?

293
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,293
It's like they're alive.

294
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,996
They are.

295
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:09,337
I would put mirrors

296
00:21:09,372 --> 00:21:11,806
behind the entire world if I could.

297
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,283
There, there.

298
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,905
Vanessa!

299
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,323
Vanessa, come back!

300
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,727
- This is obscene! You mustn't!
- How can I not?

301
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,429
Have you no shame?

302
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,614
Get upstairs this instant!

303
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,702
How dare you speak to me of shame?

304
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,505
Get upstairs yourself and
make amends to my father.

305
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,074
I have to see her.

306
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,859
To do what?

307
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:52,946
Make this right.

308
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:04,441
I always thought my traveling
would kill my family.

309
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,442
Being away so long.

310
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,212
My thoughtlessness...

311
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:14,316
I never imagined it would
be a cruel little girl.

312
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,689
When the illness came, it was absolute.

313
00:24:54,723 --> 00:24:57,225
I was aware of almost nothing.

314
00:24:57,259 --> 00:24:59,894
The doctors were at a loss to explain it.

315
00:24:59,928 --> 00:25:02,964
Because, you see, it was inexplicable.

316
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:21,782
Thank you. Thank you.

317
00:25:21,817 --> 00:25:23,717
I... I have her. I have her.

318
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:33,327
You must eat.

319
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,887
They don't think it's epilepsy anymore.

320
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:46,155
Did I tell you that?

321
00:25:50,411 --> 00:25:52,913
Dr. Kingston doesn't know what to think.

322
00:25:52,947 --> 00:25:54,898
Ridiculous little man.

323
00:25:57,151 --> 00:25:58,584
They fear...

324
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:03,473
They fear that, perhaps, it's your brain...

325
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:07,993
Something inside you.

326
00:26:10,964 --> 00:26:13,165
What else...

327
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:16,368
What else? Um, Mina's gone.

328
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,805
She didn't want to stay here.

329
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:23,242
Should we not talk of Mina?

330
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:26,945
I don't know.

331
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,283
I don't know.

332
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:37,622
We don't talk to the
Murrays, or they to us.

333
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,094
I tried going over there.

334
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:44,028
I was not welcome.

335
00:26:44,797 --> 00:26:47,999
Sir Mal... Sir Malcolm...

336
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:02,613
They don't know what's
wrong with you, darling.

337
00:27:07,185 --> 00:27:08,819
The seizures...

338
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:11,121
The seizures are so terrible.

339
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:18,662
We shall be consulting
a specialist in London.

340
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:22,665
You always liked London.

341
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,836
So, perhaps the change...

342
00:27:28,006 --> 00:27:30,473
We've booked rooms at the Strand.

343
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,776
There's a...

344
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,845
There's a clinic nearby that are well known

345
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:37,313
for treating women's disorders.

346
00:27:37,348 --> 00:27:38,848
An asylum.

347
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:49,659
I am not mad, Mother.

348
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:55,297
I am not unhappy.

349
00:27:57,433 --> 00:27:59,401
You should let me die.

350
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:30,364
Vanessa,

351
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,636
do you understand what I've said?

352
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:43,944
I think it best if you
stepped outside, Mrs. Ives.

353
00:28:43,978 --> 00:28:45,179
I'll stay.

354
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:46,914
I must speak frankly to your husband.

355
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:48,716
I'd like to stay.

356
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,452
This form of catatonia
is not unknown to me.

357
00:28:51,486 --> 00:28:54,322
The unusual physical exertions
are manifestations of...

358
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:56,424
They were not exertions.

359
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:59,359
She was being tormented.

360
00:28:59,393 --> 00:29:01,095
I have seen epileptic seizures

361
00:29:01,129 --> 00:29:02,996
that have broken bones, Mrs. Ives.

362
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:05,132
None of this impossible, just rare.

363
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,937
Hysteria of a psychosexual
nature can be treated.

364
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:11,839
The treatments involve narcotics

365
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:14,241
and escalating hydrotherapy.

366
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:17,076
Cold water reduces
circulation to the brain,

367
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:21,046
thereby reducing the
metabolism and motor activity.

368
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,482
The agitation and mental trauma will slow

369
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:24,916
and then cease.

370
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:28,053
I've seen it work, Mr.
Ives, you can have no doubt.

371
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:30,789
And what if it doesn't work?

372
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:32,891
If we see no improvement,

373
00:29:32,925 --> 00:29:35,293
there are surgical options open to us.

374
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:36,894
Yes.

375
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:41,466
Let's do that.

376
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,569
Mr. and Mrs. Ives, please
leave the room immediately.

377
00:29:53,312 --> 00:29:56,197
It is very good to hear
your voice, Vanessa.

378
00:29:59,251 --> 00:30:02,286
I'm Dr. Christopher Banning
and I hope to help you.

379
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:03,854
Your parents have...

380
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:05,556
I want to be out there.

381
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:07,658
You will be.

382
00:30:07,692 --> 00:30:09,026
We have a lovely garden that...

383
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,895
I prefer the ocean.

384
00:30:12,463 --> 00:30:15,015
Have you seen someone who's drowned?

385
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,068
I have.

386
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,904
Not a dog or a cat.

387
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:22,039
Not enough soul in a dog or a cat.

388
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:23,790
I mean a man.

389
00:30:25,209 --> 00:30:26,943
A hundred men.

390
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:30,046
A slave ship.

391
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,183
Yes. More than anything.

392
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,085
Pulled right down, with
the men still chained.

393
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:41,190
Souls in torment who now find
themselves in greater torment.

394
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,496
Have you seen that, Dr.
Christopher Matthew Banning?

395
00:30:54,471 --> 00:30:57,405
Vanessa, it's very important
to me that you sit down now.

396
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,180
Who's Vanessa?

397
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:46,820
Mrs. Ives, may I step in?

398
00:35:48,123 --> 00:35:49,389
Of course.

399
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:52,759
Mr. Ives.

400
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:54,293
Peter.

401
00:35:54,328 --> 00:35:56,295
I've come to say goodbye.

402
00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,499
I'm, um, off to Africa with my father.

403
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,138
- May I see her?
- I...

404
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:07,040
- Yes.
- ...don't think...

405
00:36:07,574 --> 00:36:09,008
Stay here.

406
00:36:10,277 --> 00:36:11,444
You...

407
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:13,579
You mustn't be shocked.

408
00:36:13,614 --> 00:36:15,381
She's much changed.

409
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:27,392
Van...

410
00:36:29,996 --> 00:36:31,280
Oh, Van...

411
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,569
Will she die?

412
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,089
If there is a God.

413
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,509
Is she always like this?

414
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:45,877
No.

415
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:48,980
There are episodes of activity.

416
00:36:51,484 --> 00:36:52,717
May I sit with her?

417
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:54,619
Yes. Of course.

418
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,912
Does she know me?

419
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:25,683
We don't know.

420
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:27,885
But talk to her, it's meant to help.

421
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,857
Hello, Van.

422
00:37:35,193 --> 00:37:36,793
It's Peter.

423
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:38,611
Closer, I'm afraid.

424
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:50,172
It's Peter.

425
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,861
I'm off to Africa.

426
00:37:58,649 --> 00:38:00,667
Can you believe it?

427
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:05,020
Finally having that
adventure we talked about.

428
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,391
Very excited.

429
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:15,231
I walked by the shore yesterday

430
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:17,166
where we used to swim.

431
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:24,706
You should have kissed me.

432
00:38:30,813 --> 00:38:33,949
Will you kiss me now?

433
00:39:00,175 --> 00:39:02,443
You're going to die there.

434
00:39:04,413 --> 00:39:06,580
You're going to die there.

435
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:43,349
Peter.

436
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:45,818
Good luck on your trip.

437
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:48,686
And thank you for coming.

438
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:56,794
Of course.

439
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,930
Peter,

440
00:39:58,965 --> 00:40:01,099
what did she say to you?

441
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:06,421
I couldn't make her out.

442
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,780
Do you know Keats?

443
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:16,504
The poet, I mean, Keats, the poet.

444
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,142
I can't speak.

445
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:22,912
I'm too weak.

446
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:24,679
No, you're not.

447
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:30,518
You are not here.

448
00:41:31,787 --> 00:41:33,522
And yet...

449
00:41:39,062 --> 00:41:40,762
Who are you?

450
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:43,798
You are not Sir Malcolm.

451
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:46,535
You have to name a thing
to make it live, don't you?

452
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:52,440
And shall I name you?

453
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:54,742
Only if you want me to live.

454
00:41:54,777 --> 00:41:56,377
Serpent.

455
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:58,680
Is that what you mean?

456
00:41:58,714 --> 00:42:02,149
Enchanter, Deceiver, Prince
of Darkness, Devil of the Pit?

457
00:42:02,184 --> 00:42:05,252
Have you such contempt for your old friend?

458
00:42:07,322 --> 00:42:11,025
So, the Keats...

459
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,160
Four lines from Ode to a Nightingale

460
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:15,796
have always struck a chord with me.

461
00:42:16,564 --> 00:42:18,732
Keats was dying when he wrote them,

462
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:19,867
and he knew he was dying,

463
00:42:19,901 --> 00:42:23,136
which adds to the
piquancy, don't you think?

464
00:42:24,806 --> 00:42:26,406
Would you like to hear them?

465
00:42:27,074 --> 00:42:28,509
Do I have a choice?

466
00:42:28,543 --> 00:42:29,610
Vanessa, please.

467
00:42:29,644 --> 00:42:32,613
You've always had a choice.

468
00:42:32,647 --> 00:42:35,181
You allowed all this to happen.

469
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:38,785
Hell, you sought it out and fucked it.

470
00:42:42,589 --> 00:42:44,824
You could have shut the door at any time.

471
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:46,058
You still can.

472
00:42:46,727 --> 00:42:49,061
Right now. Will you?

473
00:42:52,766 --> 00:42:54,199
Yes.

474
00:42:54,234 --> 00:42:57,703
And give up everything
we could have together?

475
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:01,556
The true knowledge of man's
virtue, as well as his sin.

476
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,759
The power.

477
00:43:04,945 --> 00:43:07,112
The sight beyond this world.

478
00:43:07,147 --> 00:43:09,415
I want nothing beyond this world.

479
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,250
Don't lie to me.

480
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:17,356
You've always been drawn to the deep ocean,

481
00:43:18,925 --> 00:43:21,125
to the dark whisper,

482
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:25,897
a mirror behind the glass eyes.

483
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:31,269
To life at its fullest.

484
00:43:32,572 --> 00:43:34,773
Will you close that door now?

485
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:39,911
So, the Keats.

486
00:43:39,946 --> 00:43:42,380
The lines from Keats.

487
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:43,981
Yes.

488
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:47,985
"Darkling, I listen

489
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:53,858
"and, for many a time I have been
half in love with easeful Death,

490
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,262
"Call'd him soft names
in many a mused rhyme

491
00:43:58,297 --> 00:44:04,134
"To take into the air my quiet breath."

492
00:44:17,848 --> 00:44:20,417
So the darkness spoke.

493
00:44:20,818 --> 00:44:22,285
Yes.

494
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:27,089
But you listened.

495
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,237
May the soul of Claire Ives

496
00:45:16,272 --> 00:45:18,406
and the souls of all the faithful

497
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,642
departed through the mercy of God

498
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:21,976
rest in peace.

499
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,579
- Amen.
- Amen.

500
00:46:34,281 --> 00:46:35,881
Sister.

501
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:40,052
I do not blame you.

502
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:43,322
Whatever sin,

503
00:46:43,357 --> 00:46:45,823
it has been forgiven in your suffering.

504
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,228
So much suffering.

505
00:46:52,465 --> 00:46:54,666
It is more than I deserve,

506
00:46:55,635 --> 00:46:57,869
but I can't forgive myself.

507
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:00,605
There's so much to say.

508
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,239
Or so little.

509
00:47:08,213 --> 00:47:10,515
I'm married now.

510
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:12,450
Can you imagine that?

511
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:15,453
He's a lawyer,

512
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:18,021
in the employ of Mr. Hawkins of Essex.

513
00:47:19,992 --> 00:47:21,058
He doesn't have a mustache

514
00:47:21,093 --> 00:47:23,760
like my gallant Captain Branson,

515
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:28,632
but Mr. Harker's a good
man and he loves me.

516
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:38,208
I'm happy for you.

517
00:47:41,212 --> 00:47:42,946
And our poor Peter.

518
00:47:43,581 --> 00:47:45,081
I'm so sorry.

519
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:47,918
If only you had run after
him that day in the maze,

520
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:53,356
and held him tight, and told him not to go

521
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:55,908
and that you loved him for his weakness.

522
00:47:57,261 --> 00:47:58,994
How do you know about that?

523
00:48:01,398 --> 00:48:03,966
I know about many things now, Vanessa.

524
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:07,804
The master has taught me much.

525
00:48:11,508 --> 00:48:13,609
Things no one should ever know.

526
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:15,895
Help me.

527
00:48:17,948 --> 00:48:19,715
Save me from him.

528
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:20,916
Please.

529
00:49:13,602 --> 00:49:15,469
Mina needs our help.

530
00:49:16,671 --> 00:49:18,505
Will you let me in?

531
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:25,211
And there's nothing more?

532
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:26,546
No.

533
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:31,451
You believe you can reach out to her again?

534
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:33,152
Or she to me.

535
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,555
I know you do not credit it.

536
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:38,557
You know nothing of me.

537
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:49,035
Do you know how many men I've killed?

538
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:52,370
In Africa we walked in blood every step.

539
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,008
There was a time I would
gladly have killed you.

540
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:01,462
There may come a time when I gladly shall.

541
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:06,651
But for now, I can make use of you.

542
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:09,454
- And no more?
- What else?

543
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:11,356
Forgiveness?

544
00:50:13,225 --> 00:50:16,961
Go to your Roman church for
that, you'll find none here.

545
00:50:24,603 --> 00:50:26,504
Have you imagined for one moment

546
00:50:26,538 --> 00:50:28,605
what this has been for me?

547
00:50:30,576 --> 00:50:35,012
An unforgivable transgression
that has marked me for life.

548
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:37,748
You think you've suffered.

549
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,984
You think you know blood.

550
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:42,953
You think you've walked on corpses.

551
00:50:42,988 --> 00:50:47,524
Spread them from here to the
horizon and I have walked further!

552
00:50:48,626 --> 00:50:52,662
You weak, foul, lustful, vainglorious man.

553
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:55,999
How dare you presume
to speak to me of death?

554
00:50:58,936 --> 00:51:01,437
Then we shall speak of it together.

555
00:51:08,278 --> 00:51:09,813
Yes.

556
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:12,581
We will follow it to Mina.

557
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:16,486
Yes.

558
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:18,588
And then?

559
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:21,090
You will be done.

560
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,858
I will walk on.

561
00:51:27,864 --> 00:51:30,499
I'll have Sembene prepare a room.

562
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,102
This is your home now.

563
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:44,013
There is no exculpation I expect of you.

564
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:47,615
My guilt is my own and
that I carry with me.

565
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:51,019
It is my present and my future.

566
00:51:51,054 --> 00:51:54,589
It has damned me well beyond
this short life of mine.

567
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:02,897
But I will not rest until you are safe.

568
00:52:04,266 --> 00:52:06,968
There is no other purpose in my life.

569
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,840
I shall love you always.

570
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,709
Your dearest friend, Vanessa.

571
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,117
Postscript.

572
00:53:32,152 --> 00:53:33,818
Your father loves you very much

573
00:53:33,853 --> 00:53:36,455
and would do anything to save you.

574
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:39,258
But I love you in a different way.

575
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:44,228
I love you enough

576
00:53:44,964 --> 00:53:45,997
to kill you.

577
00:53:56,508 --> 00:54:01,508
