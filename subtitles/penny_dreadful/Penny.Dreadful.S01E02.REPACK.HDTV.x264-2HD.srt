1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,142
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

2
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:13,922
What might I do for you?

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,500
I have a need for a gentleman

4
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:18,390
who's not hesitant to engage
in dangerous endeavors.

5
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:20,192
- This is the individual?
- Yes.

6
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:21,293
We're looking for someone.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,662
Do not be amazed at anything you see.

8
00:00:33,806 --> 00:00:35,607
- It's not her.
- She's not here.

9
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,375
Is there another creature like that?

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,511
Tell me what this is all about?

11
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,113
Sir Malcolm's daughter
was taken by a creature

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,582
such as the one we killed.

13
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:46,118
To save her, I would murder the world.

14
00:00:46,185 --> 00:00:48,220
- Join me, Doctor.
- Why me?

15
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:50,021
Because you were unafraid
to pull back the skin

16
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,823
and look beneath.

17
00:00:51,858 --> 00:00:53,024
Hold on, what's this?

18
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,226
The source of the writing,

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,394
it's from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

20
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:57,829
The body you bought was not human.

21
00:00:57,864 --> 00:00:59,898
- Are there more?
- At least one.

22
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:02,334
You seem to be a free thinker
who might imagine a world

23
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:05,237
where science and
superstition walk hand in hand.

24
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:10,642
My name is Victor Frankenstein.

25
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:14,846
Carnage. It's like a battlefield.

26
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:18,817
Damn him that did it. Right to hell.

28
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:47,025
- Take the topsail down!
- Wait for the next tide!

29
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:42,313
One of those nights, has it been?

30
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:44,215
Do you have any whiskey?

31
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:46,584
The more pertinent question
might be as follows:

32
00:05:46,619 --> 00:05:48,920
Do you have money?

33
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:54,626
Much as you like, friend.

34
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:49,247
We should give you a name.

35
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,152
You're a form of new
mankind, so... perhaps Adam?

36
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,957
No.

37
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,960
Theological connotations
aren't very "us" are they?

38
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:05,396
I know, you shall choose your own name.

39
00:07:05,464 --> 00:07:07,799
My mother taught me many things.

40
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,602
Among the most useful,

41
00:07:10,636 --> 00:07:13,104
is one must always have
Shakespeare close to hand.

42
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:31,222
Your turn.

43
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,809
Proteus.

44
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,516
Proteus.

45
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:04,422
Proteus.

46
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:26,778
No. I'm sorry, I... I
have to leave you now.

47
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,746
I won't be long.

48
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:31,482
I have an appointment to make some money.

49
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:34,452
After all, I have two mouths to feed now.

50
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:38,890
No, no, you stay.

51
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,191
I'll be back presently.

52
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:43,561
Mm... P... Proteus. Mm...

53
00:08:43,596 --> 00:08:46,898
Shh... shh... it's all right.

54
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:51,869
I'll be here again before you know it.

55
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:26,004
Good evening. Can I help you?

56
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,048
Well, nice to meet you too.

57
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:51,329
And you.

58
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:56,134
What happened to your hand?

59
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:58,369
Long story.

60
00:09:58,404 --> 00:10:00,638
Lucky it's early.

61
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,575
Challenging night.

62
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,578
Aren't you mysterious?

63
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:09,747
Other than the damnable goddamn sailors,

64
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:13,184
we don't get your kind in here much.

65
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,986
You mean Americans?

66
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,020
That'll serve.

67
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,591
I was employed here in
the entertainment business.

68
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:21,993
Jesus, you're not actor are you?

69
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,062
Not precisely.

70
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:28,199
Praise the lord for that.
I knew an actor once.

71
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:30,267
Always sucking up the
oxygen from the room, he was.

72
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,569
I was ever faint.

73
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:37,075
Are you still in the theater?

74
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:39,010
- I don't think so.
- What trade do you have then?

75
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:41,979
Well, I could shoot the ace out
of a playing card at fifty paces.

76
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,981
Well, that'll come in useful, I'm sure.

77
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,116
You'd be surprised.

78
00:10:45,184 --> 00:10:47,985
Not much surprises me.

79
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,224
I see you live here, I take it?

80
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:56,194
Upstairs. It's palatial.

81
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,231
You been in London long?

82
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,533
A couple of years.

83
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:04,035
I came in search of those green pastures

84
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,403
you hear tell about.

85
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,040
I tried it in the looming trade

86
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:11,442
but it's all industrial
now with the big machines.

87
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,311
I worked over in a factory in Shoreditch,

88
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:17,115
but 'twas a dispiriting endeavor.

89
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,952
One by one, we were all
replaced by better new machines.

90
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,154
It's no harm.

91
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:24,455
There is always a way to make a living

92
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:27,058
when you've a bit of flesh, isn't there?

93
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:28,659
I couldn't say.

94
00:11:28,694 --> 00:11:31,429
I'll bet you could.

95
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:38,035
Me lungs are buggered.

96
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:43,867
I'd like to say it was from the dire
working conditions of the factory.

97
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:47,578
It's more likely God being
a right playful fucker.

98
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:50,848
I'm Ethan Chandler.

99
00:11:54,253 --> 00:11:55,486
Brona Croft.

100
00:11:55,554 --> 00:11:57,088
Brona?

101
00:11:57,122 --> 00:11:58,389
It's Gaelic.

102
00:11:58,457 --> 00:11:59,657
What does it mean?

103
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,161
Sadness.

104
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,702
Thank you for the breakfast, Mr. Chandler.

105
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:14,071
Properly fortified.

106
00:12:14,106 --> 00:12:15,506
I'm off to look for work
that a machine can't do...

107
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:18,476
yet anyway.

108
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:23,114
You have any rooms available?

109
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,595
He's here.

110
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:40,798
Unbutton the top of your dress.

111
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:54,345
Doctor Frankenstein, thank you for coming.

112
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,948
You remember Miss Ives?

113
00:12:57,015 --> 00:12:59,217
- How do you do?
- Doctor.

114
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,552
This way.

115
00:13:03,555 --> 00:13:05,556
And how go your researches, Doctor?

116
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:08,726
Oh! I would say distinctly promising.

117
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,362
You are unusually jovial, sir.

118
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,831
The caprices of science, Miss Ives.

119
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:19,136
God.

120
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:29,747
How did you remove the skin?

121
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,782
Carrion beetles.

122
00:13:31,817 --> 00:13:33,951
- Essex?
- Suffolk.

123
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:36,587
Fair enough.

124
00:13:36,622 --> 00:13:40,791
It won't last forever, so let's get to it.

125
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:43,361
- Blood, you say?
- If you would.

126
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:46,564
Have you translated the hieroglyphics?

127
00:13:46,598 --> 00:13:48,065
I went about it.

128
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,220
They're apparently from the
Egyptian Book of the Dead.

129
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,802
Do you know it?

130
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:55,172
Not intimately,

131
00:13:55,207 --> 00:13:57,408
but I've studied theology over the years.

132
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:59,577
The Ancient Egyptian
religions were unique in a way.

133
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:01,212
They had a singular goal.

134
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:02,680
Not transmutation to an afterlife,

135
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:05,483
but something even more profound:

136
00:14:05,517 --> 00:14:07,618
Eternal life.

137
00:14:07,653 --> 00:14:09,821
But I'm no expert.

138
00:14:09,938 --> 00:14:12,023
Well, we're seeing a
specialist, Friday in fact.

139
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,625
I'll let you know what we discover.

140
00:14:14,693 --> 00:14:17,228
Oh, that won't be necessary.
I'm only a dabbler.

141
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:20,231
Romantic poetry, Doctor?

142
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,734
Man does not live only
in the empirical world.

143
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:28,139
We must seek the ephemeral or why live?

144
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,641
"If this belief from heaven be sent,

145
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:32,843
if such be nature's holy plan... "

146
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:36,247
"Have I not reason to lament... "

147
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,616
"What man has made of man."

148
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,394
Well, I can confirm that it's human blood,

149
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,162
or at least vertebrate.

150
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:46,998
It has the standard
erythrocytes and thrombocytes.

151
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:51,602
The more unusual properties
are beyond my expertise.

152
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,304
You'll want to speak to a hematologist.

153
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:56,908
Then I'll engage one and
you'll consult with him.

154
00:14:56,975 --> 00:14:58,209
I'm not sure that I have
the time. My own work...

155
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:01,078
No, you will.

156
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:03,781
Your remittance. I hope it's satisfactory.

157
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,885
I'm sure it will be.

158
00:15:10,055 --> 00:15:13,624
Good afternoon, Sir Malcolm. Miss Ives.

159
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,627
Oh! If you discover anything
pertinent in the hieroglyphics,

160
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:18,296
let me know.

161
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,830
Or even something ephemeral.

162
00:15:27,439 --> 00:15:29,640
What was all that poetry?

163
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:32,643
Our young doctor has a secret.

164
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:42,119
I'm thinking I may have to look elsewhere.

165
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,854
A line has to be drawn.

166
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:46,958
Well, I can only apologize.

167
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,159
Perhaps you can help me with somebody else.

168
00:15:48,226 --> 00:15:49,660
I'll see what I can do.

169
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:36,507
Thank you so much for coming.

170
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:42,480
My name is Dorian Gray.

171
00:16:52,157 --> 00:16:55,493
Inspector, Sir Malcolm Murray is outside.

172
00:16:55,527 --> 00:16:58,529
Well, show him in.

173
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:05,136
Sir Malcolm, how do you do? Sit down.

174
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,405
Inspector Galsworthy, pleasure to meet you.

175
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,106
This is my man, Sembene.

176
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:11,342
How may I be of service?

177
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,344
I wish to know more about
the Spitalfields' murders.

178
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:14,745
So do many people.

179
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,847
I'm not "many people."

180
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:19,617
Nonetheless, our
investigations are private.

181
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:23,220
A couple murdered on the
street in hackney a month ago,

182
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:26,357
then a family slaughtered in
the heart of the Metropolis.

183
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:27,758
You need all the help I can give you.

184
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:29,026
Can you help?

185
00:17:31,396 --> 00:17:32,763
Are these from Spitalfields?

186
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:34,432
Uh, they're not for the faint-hearted.

187
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:37,635
My hearts never fainted.

188
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:39,537
They were Welsh, in the vegetable trade,

189
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:41,338
mother and daughter.

190
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:43,404
Not an enemy in the world that we know of.

191
00:17:43,472 --> 00:17:45,606
He took an arm and... some
of the internal organs.

192
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,974
Which organs?

193
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,976
Liver, kidney,

194
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,778
and some of the reproductive matters.

195
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,379
And you have no suspects?

196
00:17:52,414 --> 00:17:55,816
A hundred, and none.

197
00:17:55,851 --> 00:17:58,219
Now that the newspapers and
penny dreadfuls have taken it up,

198
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,121
we have lunatics coming out
of the woodwork to confess.

199
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:02,022
Every man-jack in the east end

200
00:18:02,057 --> 00:18:03,924
pointing the finger at everyone else.

201
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:06,727
Were they drained of blood?

202
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,929
Excuse me?

203
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,831
Were they drained of blood?

204
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,199
No.

205
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,637
How old was she, the daughter?

206
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:19,106
Seven.

207
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,308
What was her name?

208
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:23,844
Charlotte.

209
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:27,047
Charlotte.

210
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,619
Is it the Ripper, back again?

211
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,922
Unlikely. He only did whores.

212
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:36,223
When the next one occurs,

213
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:38,926
I shall need to see the
crime scene immediately.

214
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,727
Will there be a next time?

215
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:42,062
Assuredly.

216
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:43,631
Thank you for your time, Inspector.

217
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,465
When I have information to share with you,

218
00:18:44,533 --> 00:18:48,235
I promise I shall.

219
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,037
I'll tell you one thing though,
and you can take it to heart,

220
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:50,938
if you don't change your tactics,

221
00:18:50,972 --> 00:18:53,974
you'll never stop him.

222
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,076
You see, you're hunting for a man;

223
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:59,847
you need to start hunting for a beast.

224
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:25,105
Would you remove your corset, Miss Croft?

225
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,393
There's blood.

226
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:43,891
Is it consumption?

227
00:19:49,164 --> 00:19:51,332
Shall I go, sir?

228
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,902
Not unless you want to.

229
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:09,116
May I?

230
00:20:13,655 --> 00:20:16,557
Sir, you shouldn't.

231
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,925
I don't know the word.

232
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:20,928
I mean, my sickness, sir.

233
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:31,171
Expose your plates, Mr. Frawley.

234
00:20:31,206 --> 00:20:33,540
You don't mind?

235
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,975
No.

236
00:21:39,274 --> 00:21:42,443
I've never fucked a dying creature before.

237
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:45,245
Do you feel things more deeply, I wonder?

238
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:48,615
Do you feel pain?

239
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,419
- Do you?
- Find out.

240
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,859
Excellent. Stamp this for me, will you?

241
00:22:34,863 --> 00:22:37,264
Cable for you, sir.

242
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,511
"Ethan, it's time for you to come home.

243
00:22:50,545 --> 00:22:53,280
You can't run away forever.

244
00:22:53,314 --> 00:22:54,715
I can handle your legal problems.

245
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,684
The Federal Marshall has been paid.

246
00:22:57,719 --> 00:23:00,888
Stop your foolishness and do as I instruct.

247
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,123
Your father."

Do you recognize that? That animal?

257
00:24:03,184 --> 00:24:05,185
Whale.

258
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:09,156
Yes, it's a whale. A sea creature.

259
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,592
Whale.

260
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:17,364
Whale. Hunting.

261
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,475
It's all right. Shhh... calm down.

262
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:34,381
Did you... did you kill a whale?

263
00:24:36,084 --> 00:24:38,685
You know the word.

264
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:44,825
- Proteus...
- Perhaps this was your trade.

265
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:50,631
You could've been a
whaler as I am a doctor.

266
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:51,945
You needn't feel ashamed of that.

267
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,293
Kill.

268
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,862
Yes, I know.

269
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,101
As you grow up,

270
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:05,205
you'll learn we all do
things which cause us shame.

271
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:07,874
Sins we have committed.

272
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:26,393
Thank you, Proteus.

00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:12,372
Sir Malcolm. Miss Ives.

279
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,274
I'm so glad you could attend.

280
00:26:14,342 --> 00:26:16,376
Thank you for coming to my wee fête.

281
00:26:16,411 --> 00:26:18,378
Thank you for having us.

282
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:21,381
I have the additional
photographs in my coach.

283
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:23,784
How forthright he is.

284
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:26,186
Must have served him
well in Darkest Africa.

285
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:29,389
Uh, my wife is somewhere about,

286
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,191
close by the gin, I would hazard.

287
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:32,893
In the parlor, perhaps.

288
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,195
Why don't you make an introduction?

289
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:37,397
Of course, Sir Malcolm.

290
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:39,766
Come along. Let's just stroll,

291
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,769
see what wickedness we can find.

292
00:26:51,512 --> 00:26:53,213
Come!

293
00:27:01,456 --> 00:27:03,790
You're too sweet.

294
00:27:31,219 --> 00:27:33,153
My name is Dorian Gray.

295
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:35,655
Vanessa Ives.

296
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,859
It's a pleasure, Miss Ives.

297
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:41,428
I couldn't help but notice your skepticism.

298
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:43,263
Am I skeptical?

299
00:27:43,331 --> 00:27:44,865
About the room.

300
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,067
Rather aggressive in the chinoiserie

301
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:49,236
and geographically
capricious to say the least.

302
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,037
In this one room,

303
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:56,243
there's Japanese, Siamese,
Egyptian, Balinese,

304
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:59,479
and something I take to be
last season's Panto of Aladdin.

305
00:28:01,582 --> 00:28:03,283
Are you a friend of Mr. Lyle's?

306
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:04,684
Never met him before tonight.

307
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:07,187
It was more of a... random invitation.

308
00:28:07,255 --> 00:28:08,455
Do you get many of those?

309
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:11,258
Entirely.

310
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,692
You could say "no."

311
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,262
I never say "no."

312
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,800
I wasn't skeptical about the room.

313
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:23,470
What then? Shall I guess?

314
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:26,773
Have on, Mr. Gray.

315
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,711
You do not belong here.

316
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,182
Even less than I.

317
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:37,818
You are not frivolous.

318
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:41,221
Your eye is careful and appraising.

319
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,889
This is not a careful room,

320
00:28:42,924 --> 00:28:46,526
although there is much to appraise.

321
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:50,797
That can divert you for only so long.

322
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:53,600
You do not like it here.
You are closed to it.

323
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,138
Yet...

324
00:28:58,172 --> 00:28:59,439
you're the only woman in this house

325
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:01,208
not wearing gloves.

326
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:06,046
Your hands want to touch,

327
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:09,149
but your head wants to appraise.

328
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:12,619
Your heart is torn between the two.

329
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,923
You were skeptical because you thought...

330
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:19,759
This was going to be a wasted evening,

331
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:23,830
but now you're not so sure.

332
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:29,069
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

333
00:29:29,136 --> 00:29:31,771
Your attention pl...

334
00:29:31,806 --> 00:29:34,174
please, you must pay attention to me.

335
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:37,344
My friends, our guest of honor has arrived.

336
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:41,381
May I present the renowned... Madame Kali!

337
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:49,890
So come along, come along around the table.

338
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:52,158
Those of you without fear,

339
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:54,794
we need at least eight people of courage.

340
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,196
Well done, well done, well done.

341
00:29:56,264 --> 00:29:57,864
Excellent! Sit.

342
00:29:57,899 --> 00:30:01,001
Sir Malcolm, take a seat. Splendid.

343
00:30:01,035 --> 00:30:03,770
Sit. Sit.

344
00:30:17,685 --> 00:30:19,219
Gentlemen, please remove your jewelry.

345
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,221
What's going on?

346
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:23,189
Ladies, please remove your gloves.

347
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:25,592
I believe we're about to
commune with the spirits.

348
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,833
This is such fun.

349
00:30:33,868 --> 00:30:35,802
Please... join hands.

350
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:40,707
Join hands...

351
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:45,211
I ask forbearance.

352
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:49,215
I ask you to suspend your disbelief

353
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:57,057
and imagine your minds floating
in the darkness of time.

354
00:30:57,091 --> 00:31:00,560
Let your imaginations be liberate

355
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:03,129
and roam with me

356
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:08,134
back in time to the ancient seas.

357
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,839
Back in time to the time
before when the spirits walked,

358
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:16,843
when the sun was new
and the old gods walked.

359
00:31:16,877 --> 00:31:19,746
I call forth Mut, mother goddess.

360
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,549
I call to the speakers of the dead.

361
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:25,885
Come to me, come to me.

362
00:31:37,131 --> 00:31:41,968
What summoned me?

363
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:49,676
I speak for the dead.

364
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:54,080
For the undying.

365
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:09,295
There's another here.

366
00:32:17,004 --> 00:32:25,004
There's... another... here.

367
00:32:25,746 --> 00:32:27,414
What does she mean?

368
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:29,516
Amunet...

369
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,720
Amunet...

370
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,924
Amunet.

371
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,160
Amunet. Serpent. Hidden one.

372
00:32:40,227 --> 00:32:41,561
Know your master. Your lover. Your master.

373
00:33:19,366 --> 00:33:22,802
Father.

374
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:24,917
Father, mine, let me come with you.

375
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:26,906
What a ripping time we'll have.

376
00:33:26,974 --> 00:33:28,975
Let me come with you.
It'll be an adventure.

377
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,777
You'll teach me!

378
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,812
I'll prove myself a proper explorer.

379
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,014
Peter loves you, Father.

380
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:44,424
But Father, if the porters go,

381
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,226
how are we to survive?

382
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:48,495
I'm not frightened, I'm not.

383
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:53,032
What an adventure. It's
so green, so beautiful.

384
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,635
But the porters are dying
and I can't go on, I'm sick.

385
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:58,438
Is it the dysentery?

386
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm bleeding.

387
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:04,444
Oh God, I'm bleeding.
I'm shitting blood now.

388
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:09,115
I have no more clean trousers. I'm sorry.

389
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,919
I'll stay at base camp. You go. Leave me.

390
00:34:12,953 --> 00:34:15,121
Will you name a mountain after me?

391
00:34:15,156 --> 00:34:16,923
Are you proud of me?

392
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,260
Go!

393
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,037
Goodbye.

394
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:36,142
I'll see you soon, Father.

395
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,679
Father.

396
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:52,258
Cold.

397
00:34:57,164 --> 00:35:02,101
♪ close the window, my true love ♪

398
00:35:02,136 --> 00:35:07,473
♪ and gently drops the rain ♪

399
00:35:07,508 --> 00:35:14,113
♪ I have never had but one true love... ♪

400
00:35:14,148 --> 00:35:19,452
I am... weak.

401
00:35:22,523 --> 00:35:26,893
Can't feel my hands.

402
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:28,194
There's no water.

403
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:33,199
I can't swallow.

404
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:38,938
You knew I was dying...

405
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:41,040
didn't you, Father?

406
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:50,216
Did you name a mountain after me?

407
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,692
Oh!

408
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:45,204
Amunet, girl? No, much older.

409
00:36:49,243 --> 00:36:52,912
Father, Mina's waiting.

410
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,081
No!

411
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,150
Shhh...

412
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:08,995
I wonder...

413
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:12,705
I wonder when was the moment you knew

414
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:15,802
you wanted to fuck her?

415
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:18,237
Why were you not more discrete?

416
00:37:18,272 --> 00:37:21,240
Vanessa heard you. The two of you.

417
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:23,409
She heard you fucking and she was curious.

418
00:37:23,444 --> 00:37:25,045
She walked closer, she rounded the corner

419
00:37:25,112 --> 00:37:26,612
and discovered you, the two of you,

420
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:30,116
you know, fucking. Fucking her cunt.

421
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:33,619
Vanessa saw that.

422
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:38,458
Fucking animal.

423
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:41,728
You man. You animal.

424
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,864
You man. You animal.

425
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:48,034
Betrayer! Creature!

426
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:53,272
I look into his eyes and
they are red with blood

427
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,842
like from Peter's ass.

428
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,044
His lips are red like blood from her cunt

429
00:37:58,078 --> 00:37:59,946
when you fucked her.

430
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,383
His teeth are sharp like
yours when you bit her cunt

431
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,452
and it's so cold and dark
and wet like the jungle.

432
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:10,690
Like tears, I am crying.
I am so afraid, Father.

433
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:14,594
Find me! Find me! Save me! Save me!

434
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:26,852
Breakfast, Miss Croft?

435
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:31,691
Our usual repast?

436
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:35,094
I won't say "no."

437
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,395
And call me Brona, will ya?

438
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:37,897
The way you say that is ridiculous.

439
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:41,200
"Mizz Croft."

440
00:41:41,268 --> 00:41:45,771
There's no "Z" in it. Just
being laconic, I suppose.

441
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:48,174
- Oh, like all Americans.
- Precisely.

442
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,009
So how goes the job hunt?

443
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:53,512
Employment on your feet is hard to come by.

444
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,581
I've found a bit of a sideline though.

445
00:41:57,918 --> 00:41:59,819
Photographic subject, don't you know.

446
00:41:59,886 --> 00:42:01,721
For the calendars and such?

447
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:05,024
If you keep your calendar in a whorehouse.

448
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:09,295
The pictures are a tad risquz.
What will the bishop think?

449
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:12,898
And what about you?

450
00:42:12,933 --> 00:42:14,734
Don't you need to be pursuing work?

451
00:42:14,768 --> 00:42:19,805
I have work. I am a maritime supervisor.

452
00:42:22,242 --> 00:42:24,744
I sit here and make sure
all the boats get past okay.

453
00:42:24,778 --> 00:42:26,145
Almost had a collision last night.

454
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:28,614
It was thrilling.

455
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:33,119
- You eaten?
-  No.

456
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:34,020
Let me buy us some real breakfast.

457
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,325
I've got to sleep, but thanks.

458
00:42:41,528 --> 00:42:43,729
Well, how about dinner tonight?

459
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,367
You're not mistaking me
for a sweet little debutante

460
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:49,769
at the summer fair, are you?

461
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:51,137
That kind never did take my interest.

462
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:52,938
Oh, you like things back-alley.

463
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:54,640
I like things to be what they are.

464
00:42:56,977 --> 00:43:00,346
Then dinner it is. Anywhere but here.

465
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,947
Well, I don't know London much.

466
00:43:01,982 --> 00:43:04,450
I do.

467
00:43:26,106 --> 00:43:27,973
I'm not asking her back.

468
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,113
Although she put Madame
Kali to shame, I must say.

469
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:37,216
It was a riveting performance.

470
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:41,420
The dilettantes among
the company were outraged,

471
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,022
but if one is to engage

472
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:45,224
with the primordial forces of darkness,

473
00:43:45,258 --> 00:43:51,497
one must expect a bit
of... social awkwardness.

474
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:53,632
Although the language...
tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk!

475
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,634
My apologies.

476
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:59,004
My wife... mortified,

477
00:44:01,308 --> 00:44:03,843
although the gin helped.

478
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:07,613
All right, then, let me see them.

479
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:12,418
Yes, these are the three I've seen.

480
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,822
You have had some of this
translated, haven't you?

481
00:44:16,857 --> 00:44:19,658
- No.
- No?

482
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:20,926
This figure, the snake-headed one,

483
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:22,862
that's Amunet,

484
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:25,064
who performed a spectacular
star turn last night.

485
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:26,866
Who is she?

486
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,467
A goddess: "The Hidden One."

487
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:29,869
Why "The Hidden One"?

488
00:44:29,936 --> 00:44:31,871
Because despite her outward divinity,

489
00:44:31,905 --> 00:44:36,642
she had a monster within her,
not unlike your Miss Ives.

490
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,458
This is new.

491
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:53,993
What do you mean?

492
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,961
This hasn't been seen before by anyone.

493
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:59,465
- How do you know?
- Because it's impossible.

494
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:01,667
Is there more of this? More pictures?

495
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:03,803
- Yes.
- I'm going to ask you to do something.

496
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,172
Wherever you came across
this, whatever your interest,

497
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:09,809
whatever need... you think you have,

498
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,310
you must forget you ever saw it.

499
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:12,578
First, you tell me why.

500
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:17,516
Amunet was the consort of Amun-Ra,

501
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,919
one of the great gods.

502
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:24,190
He was the first "Hidden One."
The original serpent prince.

503
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:27,126
So named not for any
particular reptilian qualities,

504
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,331
but for the power of rebirth;
like a snake shedding its skin.

505
00:45:32,155 --> 00:45:35,657
Everlasting, perpetual life...

506
00:45:37,894 --> 00:45:43,265
Sustained by feeding
on the souls of others.

507
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:46,001
Amunet and Amun-Ra never
appear in the same incantation.

508
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:49,605
It is inconceivable in pharaonic
religion to conjoin them;

509
00:45:49,672 --> 00:45:53,809
their narratives are
kept completely separate.

510
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,210
- Why?
- Because...

511
00:45:55,278 --> 00:45:56,612
If they ever came together,

512
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:59,114
Amunet would become the mother of evil.

513
00:45:59,148 --> 00:46:01,516
All light would end

514
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,918
and the world would live in darkness.

515
00:46:02,952 --> 00:46:07,022
The hidden ones would emerge and rule.

516
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:12,728
Amunet-Amun-Ra conjoined.

517
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:17,032
This is a spell foretelling
the annihilation of man

518
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,601
and the coming of the beast.

519
00:46:24,374 --> 00:46:28,744
I would not tell Miss Ives this.

520
00:46:28,778 --> 00:46:33,815
After all, who wants to know
they're hunted by the devil?

521
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,778
How long?

522
00:47:02,845 --> 00:47:06,181
Victor, how long do we walk?

523
00:47:06,215 --> 00:47:08,183
Long walk, yes? Victor, yes?

524
00:47:08,217 --> 00:47:10,786
Everything in one day.

525
00:47:10,853 --> 00:47:12,888
One night.

526
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,990
It's coming to night now, not day.

527
00:47:15,024 --> 00:47:17,859
Night. Night. Yes, night.

528
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:21,697
Why are you slow?

529
00:47:21,764 --> 00:47:23,665
Now listen, Proteus.

530
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,802
This is your very first
time outside of this room

531
00:47:26,836 --> 00:47:28,970
and it's all going to
be very new to you, so...

532
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:30,806
try to stay calm, yes?

533
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,874
Yes, Victor.

534
00:47:55,531 --> 00:47:56,698
Don't be frightened.

535
00:47:58,334 --> 00:47:59,801
Here it is.

536
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,743
Everything.

537
00:48:24,927 --> 00:48:28,630
Everything.

538
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,284
- Dog.
- Dog.

539
00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:51,253
Dog. Dog.

540
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:56,691
Spices! Spices from the Orient!

541
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,060
Look at these.

542
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,200
A horse.

543
00:49:09,005 --> 00:49:12,107
Warm.

544
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:14,075
- Hot. Hot-hot.
- Hot.

545
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:20,715
No. No, thank you. No thank you.

546
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,284
- Hat.
- Yeah.

547
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,721
Hat? Hat!

548
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,690
- No. No-no-no.
- Hat.

549
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,614
Chestnut.

550
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,642
Fairy lights.

551
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:24,145
What? No, that's something
called gas lighting.

552
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,381
It's an invisible chemical,
which means you can't see it.

553
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:28,183
It has combustible
properties that produce flame,

554
00:50:28,217 --> 00:50:30,385
thus... illumination.

555
00:50:30,419 --> 00:50:33,688
Victor, fairy lights.

556
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:34,856
Who am I to argue?

557
00:50:46,903 --> 00:50:48,570
Frigate!

558
00:50:58,648 --> 00:50:59,981
Sloop.

559
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:07,088
Scow. Barque. Top sail. Bowline. Jib boom.

560
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,595
Wife.

561
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:17,032
What did you say?

562
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:19,234
On the dock.

563
00:51:19,302 --> 00:51:22,103
Wife.

564
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,210
Doreen.

565
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:36,718
Victor, what am I?

566
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,024
Tell me. Tell me.

567
00:51:45,261 --> 00:51:47,862
- Doctor.
- Sir?

568
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,265
You don't remember. We...

569
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:52,867
met with sir Malcolm and
Miss Ives where you work.

570
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:55,537
The American, of course. How do you do?

571
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,939
Well, thanks. This is Miss Brona Croft.

572
00:51:57,974 --> 00:51:58,573
- Hello.
- Miss Croft.

573
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:04,179
Uh... this is my friend, Mr. Proteus.

574
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,647
Ethan Chandler.

575
00:52:08,117 --> 00:52:10,852
How do you do? My name is Mister Proteus.

576
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:16,291
Oh, and this is Miss Croft.

577
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:18,159
How do you do, Miss Croft?
My name is Mister Proteus.

578
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:27,002
- Fine evening, isn't it?
- Yes. Yes, very.

579
00:52:27,069 --> 00:52:29,004
Enjoy the evening, Mr.
Chandler. Miss Croft.

580
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:31,906
Chestnut?

581
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:34,876
Thank you. That's very kind.

582
00:52:36,746 --> 00:52:38,813
Enjoy the fairy lights.

583
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:41,783
I always do.

584
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:51,926
What?

585
00:53:00,836 --> 00:53:03,304
... And what else?

586
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:07,809
Then we saw the frigate and the sloop.

587
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:12,313
Oh, and the barque.

588
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:22,957
Then we met Mr. Ethan
Chandler and Miss Brona Croft,

589
00:53:23,025 --> 00:53:24,526
our friends on the river...

590
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,162
Well, perhaps not friends,

591
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:28,063
passing acquaintances, more like.

592
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,031
Why?

593
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:32,067
Friends are something different.

594
00:53:32,134 --> 00:53:34,169
They're people you've known for a while.

595
00:53:34,203 --> 00:53:36,738
You're comfortable with, close to.

596
00:53:36,772 --> 00:53:38,773
Like Victor.

597
00:53:38,808 --> 00:53:41,176
Yes.

598
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:42,844
Will I have many?

599
00:53:42,878 --> 00:53:45,046
If you're lucky.

600
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:48,583
I shall have many. Ten.

601
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:51,753
More than ten if we...

602
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:31,893
Your first born has returned... Father.
