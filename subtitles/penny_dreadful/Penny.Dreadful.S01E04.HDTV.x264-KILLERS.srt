1
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,632
Previously on Penny Dreadful...

2
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,433
Is it the Ripper come back?

3
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:15,236
The body you bought, I can
confirm that it's human blood.

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:18,172
The more unusual properties
are beyond my expertise.

5
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:19,641
You'll want to speak to a hematologist.

6
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:21,943
Then I'll engage one and
you'll consult with him.

7
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,312
Would you remove your corset, Miss Croft?

8
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,152
Do you have medicine?

9
00:00:31,186 --> 00:00:32,387
No, who has money for that?

10
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,921
She has consumption.

11
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:35,855
Who doesn't love a lost cause?

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,691
Welcome to the Grand Guignol.

13
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,926
You shall be our new stage rat.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,095
I seek a companion.

15
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,930
Rise and walk with me, creator.

16
00:00:43,964 --> 00:00:45,365
You will make me

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,734
an immortal mate.

18
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,536
I'm trying to rescue my daughter.

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,771
Do you know the name Mina?

20
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,406
I know the name Vanessa.

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,041
I think it's possible the
creature we seek wants you.

22
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:56,376
So I was bait?

23
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,644
Where is your master?

24
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,078
Everywhere.

25
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:00,847
Where is your master?

26
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,383
He's the first real
connection we have to Mina.

27
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:05,185
Even if it means beating him to death?

28
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,553
My name is Dorian Gray.

29
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:08,855
You thought this was going
to be a wasted evening,

30
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:11,124
but now you're not so sure.

31

32
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,476
Why didn't you go in?

33
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:08,680
Don't you like churches?

34
00:06:12,251 --> 00:06:14,052
Well, I suppose I do.

35
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:20,691
I find it an awful chore, the services.

36
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,028
The singing's kind of all right.

37
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,262
Yes.

38
00:06:26,264 --> 00:06:27,531
You won't go in?

39
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:30,534
Why do you think I want to?

40
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,504
The way you look at it.

41
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,073
It's only an old Catholic church.

42
00:06:36,108 --> 00:06:37,708
Right you are.

43
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,409
Where's your mother?

44
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:41,612
Oh, she passed away.

45
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,280
My little brother doesn't know,

46
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:46,315
but Papa told me as I'm
practically a grown-up.

47
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,986
My nanny's over there.

48
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:51,622
She's a beast.

49
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,859
You don't have a sweetie, do you?

50
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,361
Afraid not.

51
00:06:58,563 --> 00:07:01,331
I've a bit of peppermint in my dresser,

52
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,767
but it's very old and I daren't.

53
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,402
Very sensible.

54
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:17,113
We put Mother under the ground.

55
00:07:17,148 --> 00:07:19,082
But I don't think she'll stay there.

56
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:27,623
They never stay, do they?

57
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:30,927
Where do they go?

58
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,662
You know.

59
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,197
Do I?

60
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:36,199
Of course you do.

61
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:41,270
Heaven, silly.

62
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,071
They go to heaven.

63
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:46,375
Unless they go to the other place.

64
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:52,915
Lucy, come along.

65
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:55,851
Don't bother the lady.

66
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:57,086
Good morning, ma'am.

67
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,121
Yes, good morning.

68
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:02,875
Come along.

69
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:32,911
Mr. Gray?

70
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,113
Miss Ives.

71
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:37,816
What an unexpected pleasure.

72
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,703
Have you an interest in botany?

73
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:46,257
All I really seem to know about
plants is how to kill them.

74
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:52,197
Then let me show you
something extraordinary.

75
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,216
I like to see one
extraordinary thing every day.

76
00:09:59,404 --> 00:10:02,473
What I find so fascinating about flowers

77
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:04,309
is their duplicity.

78
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:05,910
Duplicity?

79
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:08,313
Well, their hidden depths, at any rate.

80
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:10,131
Here, look at this.

81
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:15,753
Mmm, it's beautiful.

82
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:17,187
You can do better.

83
00:10:17,222 --> 00:10:18,772
Give me words.

84
00:10:22,293 --> 00:10:25,162
Delicate, subtle fragrance.

85
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,630
Like a berry,

86
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,751
but not a woodland thing. Not a
thing of the forest, something...

87
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,704
of the jungle.

88
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,689
What does it say to you?

89
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,158
Touch me.

90
00:10:39,777 --> 00:10:41,461
With your finger.

91
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:43,162
Softly.

92
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:45,665
My scent on your neck.

93
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,234
Open your lips.

94
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,670
Taste.

95
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:59,245
Atropa belladonna. Deadly nightshade.

96
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,066
- No.
- Afraid so.

97
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:06,502
The berries are quite lethal,

98
00:11:06,536 --> 00:11:08,069
whole thing in fact.

99
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,338
You're a font of useful information.

100
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,807
God!

101
00:11:11,841 --> 00:11:14,275
No one's ever accused me
of being useful before.

102
00:11:17,313 --> 00:11:19,214
It's the adder beneath the rose, isn't it?

103
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:21,817
All of this.

104
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:24,319
They can seem so enticing and luxurious,

105
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:27,138
yet within, there's a dark thing waiting.

106
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:31,359
Things are so rarely what they seem.

107
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:33,828
Which of us does not have
our secrets, Miss Ives?

108
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,602
Ah! Here's what I wanted to show you.

109
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:56,884
Rothschild's slipper.

110
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,820
The rarest orchid on Earth,

111
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,155
and thus the most expensive.

112
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:03,591
It's only found in one place,

113
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:06,561
a particular mountain in Borneo.

114
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:09,145
It can take up to 15 years to bloom.

115
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,390
All that time, perfecting itself.

116
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:16,770
A lifetime for six perfect flowers.

117
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,891
How long will it bloom?

118
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,026
A moment.

119
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,563
Is it poisonous?

120
00:12:29,717 --> 00:12:31,768
Like all beautiful things,

121
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,437
I hope so.

122
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,593
This has been an unexpected
pleasure for me, Miss Ives,

123
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:43,896
but I'm afraid I've another engagement.

124
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,532
You will excuse me?

125
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,235
Oh. Yes, of course.

126
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,569
I'm off to the theater tonight.

127
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,837
More beautiful illusion.

128
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,772
Do enjoy the flowers.

129
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,137
Unusual torpor to be sure.

130
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,775
Maybe it's from the ice.

131
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,113
Take a look, my friend.

132
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,471
Lividity, yes?

133
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:27,940
Yes.

134
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,843
Corpuscular interaction, as you'd expect.

135
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,012
Nothing else of note?

136
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:36,164
I'm not a hematologist,
this is your bailiwick.

137
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,068
Then we shall delve a little deeper.

138
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,672
Would you be good enough to
prepare another slide for us?

139
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:52,531
You have steady hands.
Oh, to be young again.

140
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,283
You have the steadiest hands I've
ever seen, Professor Van Helsing.

141
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,336
A steady heart, perhaps.

142
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,457
We will stain the sample, yes?

143
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,546
My God.

144
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:28,199
What's happening?

145
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,600
There is no real name for the interdiction.

146
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,869
Immodestly, I confess
I invented the solution

147
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:36,139
that makes it visible to us,

148
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:39,409
so I named it after my late wife.

149
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,828
That is Hannah's Wink.

150
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,549
This blood contains a unique property

151
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,718
that prevents coagulation completely.

152
00:14:49,052 --> 00:14:50,086
To what end?

153
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:51,654
Does it have to have an end?

154
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,057
Nature does not create such
rare occurrences with no purpose.

155
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,360
Well, if one had to give a purpose to it,

156
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:00,196
it would assist with hematophagy.

157
00:15:01,132 --> 00:15:03,299
The eating of blood.

158
00:15:29,726 --> 00:15:31,527
How long have you known Sir Malcolm?

159
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:34,630
We only met recently
at a social engagement.

160
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:36,597
When he learned I was a hematologist,

161
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,833
he engaged me to consult with you.

162
00:15:38,868 --> 00:15:41,602
So he didn't tell you
where the blood was from?

163
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:42,671
The subject, I mean.

164
00:15:42,705 --> 00:15:44,505
He didn't have to.

165
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,375
Not when I saw your
reaction to Hannah's Wink.

166
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:51,377
Do you know why he wants us to analyze it?

167
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,962
Sir Malcolm is looking for a cure

168
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,166
for something he doesn't understand.

169
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:58,967
Do you?

170
00:15:59,953 --> 00:16:01,386
Intimately.

171
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:19,988
Excuse me.

172
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,608
We... we'll have to continue later.

173
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,885
Do what you have promised me.

174
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,870
- I am.
- In that house?

175
00:16:37,423 --> 00:16:38,923
My lab is a shambles.

176
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,792
I have to reconstitute my
equipment and furnishings,

177
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,026
all of which takes money!

178
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:43,928
Do what you have promised me.

179
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,930
I'm trying.

180
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,825
It's not an easy thing, this you ask of me.

181
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:51,736
I will need supplies.

182
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,037
Then find them.

183
00:16:53,072 --> 00:16:55,407
I mean a physical subject.

184
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:58,042
Who knows better than I what you mean?

185
00:16:58,077 --> 00:16:59,543
It will take time.

186
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:02,196
Do not temporize, demon.

187
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,632
Be at it!

188
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,240
My bride must be...

189
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:16,994
must be beautiful.

190
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,355
To match her mate?

191
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,489
What a simple thing it
is to snap your neck.

192
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:33,527
You are so fragile, you mortals,

193
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:38,215
such things of skin and air.

194
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,068
Such things of the past.

195
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:46,407
The future belongs to the strong,

196
00:17:47,225 --> 00:17:49,142
to the immortal races,

197
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,995
to me and my kind.

198
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,151
Look upon your master.

199
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:36,389
I wonder what lips yours
have kissed and where.

200
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:38,758
Too many, I'm sure.

201
00:18:40,844 --> 00:18:42,227
That's in the past.

202
00:18:46,982 --> 00:18:48,767
I was engaged once,

203
00:18:50,752 --> 00:18:52,436
back in Belfast.

204
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,400
Riveter in the shipyard he was.

205
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,370
Brutal man with brutal hands.

206
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,238
When he fucked me,

207
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,509
he would put one of those big hands

208
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:14,912
over my face and turn it away,

209
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,706
so he wouldn't have to look into my eyes.

210
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,960
There I was, engaged to him.

211
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,887
Why?

212
00:19:24,922 --> 00:19:27,023
There was no money.

213
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,642
It's what you did. You
married or you whored.

214
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,213
One night,

215
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,617
he was fucking me,

216
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:44,991
and he got really tough
and there was blood.

217
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,629
I went to my mother.

218
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,252
She said to go back and marry him.

219
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,793
Same day I walked down Leopold
Street off the Shankill Road

220
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,728
and fucked a stranger for money.

221
00:20:14,904 --> 00:20:17,072
We've all done things to survive.

222
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,743
There are such sins at my back

223
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:23,278
it would kill me to turn around.

224
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:39,261
I got an idea.

225
00:20:40,497 --> 00:20:42,431
I want to take my lady out on the town.

226
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:43,832
Oh, where is she?

227
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:47,002
Mmm.

228
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:49,938
Get your best duds ready
for tonight, we're going out.

229
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:51,606
My "duds"?

230
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,475
I'm off to work.

231
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:57,545
This work of yours...

232
00:20:57,947 --> 00:20:59,480
you'll be careful?

233
00:20:59,515 --> 00:21:00,882
Oh, hell.

234
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:03,751
Nothing I haven't seen before, darlin'.

235
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:07,789
Steady on, lad.

236
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:10,192
Keep your fucking needles to yourself.

237
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:11,426
Get a scalpel!

238
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,428
Cut me open. Eat up, eat up.

239
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,299
For heaven's sake, will you sedate him?

240
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,300
His chatter is becoming wearisome.

241
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:21,069
Where's Vanessa?

242
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,837
I want Mother.

243
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,538
Why?

244
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,474
Why do you want her?

245
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,744
Why does everyone want her?

246
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:33,347
So nurturing, isn't she, Sir M?

247
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,851
Gentlemen, if you will.

248
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,899
Fuck you, you butcher.

249
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,601
Butchers all.

250
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:58,773
Especially you, you toff wanker.

251
00:22:04,111 --> 00:22:06,846
Oh, this is sad.

252
00:22:09,384 --> 00:22:12,285
No, no, I don't want to sleep.

253
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,720
Why not?

254
00:22:32,907 --> 00:22:35,775
So many monsters.

255
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:45,118
Jesus.

256
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:46,685
Remind me why we're doing this again.

257
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,389
We are seeking a cure.

258
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:51,874
We don't even know what the disease is.

259
00:22:53,027 --> 00:22:54,860
We think the condition
is based in the blood,

260
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,996
so we'll start with transfusion.

261
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:59,565
Out with the old, in with the new.

262
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,234
Roll up your sleeve.

263
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,770
Why?

264
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:07,373
We need a subject.

265
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:09,141
No.

266
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,994
Roll up your sleeve, it won't hurt.

267
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:13,912
That's not a good idea.

268
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,183
Why not?

269
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:19,018
Trust me.

270
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:21,119
I'll do it.

271
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,709
We'll start with a small amount

272
00:23:27,727 --> 00:23:30,429
and work in gradual stages.

273
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:32,364
If there's an improvement, we'll continue.

274
00:23:32,398 --> 00:23:34,166
How will we be able to tell?

275
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:37,785
Well, he won't want to
eat everyone for a start.

276
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:43,808
Honestly, this will hurt a little.

277
00:23:46,745 --> 00:23:48,947
How long do we have to wait?

278
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:51,984
Sembene will alert us when he wakes up.

279
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:53,751
Are these our boys, do you think?

280
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:54,819
The creatures? No.

281
00:23:54,854 --> 00:23:57,155
"Bodies dismembered, limbs flayed."

282
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,656
Sounds awfully familiar.

283
00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:59,757
No blood drained.

284
00:23:59,792 --> 00:24:00,892
For all the bestiality,

285
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,594
it's a fully human act, I think.

286
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:05,229
Had there been more evidence
of cannibalism, then perhaps.

287
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,798
So he didn't consume the flesh?

288
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:09,233
- That's a...
- Would you stop it?

289
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,035
Holy Christ, you're both morbid fucks.

290
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:13,938
My, my. That temper of yours.

291
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:15,740
We're not all bloodless dandies.

292
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,575
- Is that what I am?
- I don't know what you are.

293
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,377
You could not understand it, believe me.

294
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:21,045
My, my. What arrogance.

295
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,014
Thin skin, Mr. Chandler.

296
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:24,949
Gentlemen.

297
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,968
Is there not enough tension in this house?

298
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:35,626
Do you know much about the Nile?

299
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,294
In my profession it's the Holy Grail.

300
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:42,098
The actual scientific value of discovering
the source is negligible of course,

301
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,367
but it's a sort of a fever.

302
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:47,370
Who will claim the prize?

303
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:51,408
Who will trace the Mother
of Waters to its origins?

304
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:56,113
World renown awaits.

305
00:25:01,084 --> 00:25:03,252
Would you like to come
with me, Mr. Chandler?

306
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:05,354
I could use a man with a temper.

307
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,157
Not enough danger for you here?

308
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:18,333
Ohh, gentlemen, you do look solemn.

309
00:25:18,368 --> 00:25:20,502
Oh, we're planning a little holiday.

310
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:22,271
Taking a holiday, are we?

311
00:25:22,472 --> 00:25:23,889
That's jolly.

312
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:25,074
Where?

313
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,877
You shall have to ask
my more robust brother.

314
00:25:27,911 --> 00:25:30,479
I've asked Mr. Chandler
to accompany me to Africa.

315
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:32,714
Oh, that.

316
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,150
Why must you always denigrate my work?

317
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,453
Because you're not really going to go.

318
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:41,356
Leave the mad larks to
the boys, Sir Malcolm.

319
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:43,525
Oh, not me, just him.

320
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,127
I'm bloodless.

321
00:25:45,161 --> 00:25:47,763
The essence of your appeal, Doctor.

322
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:54,953
You've had a long day.

323
00:25:57,073 --> 00:25:59,440
I went to look at something beautiful.

324
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:02,143
He is awake.

325
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,571
Can you hear me, Mr. Fenton?

326
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:19,193
Are you going to beat me?

327
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,695
No.

328
00:26:21,363 --> 00:26:23,164
Oh, thank you.

329
00:26:24,566 --> 00:26:26,467
Did I deserve that?

330
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:37,512
I'm so hungry.

331
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:07,274
I need blood, you fucking devil whore!

332
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:10,477
Give me rats and bats and lungs and guts

333
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:11,645
and flesh!

334
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,947
Give me what I need!

335
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,993
It will be a process.

336
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:29,829
Get him something to eat.

337
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:46,062
Not what you bargained for?

338
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,816
Never is.

339
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:53,320
I know it's disturbing. A terrible thing.

340
00:27:53,354 --> 00:27:55,854
I'm not disturbed by
him. I'm disturbed by us.

341
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:01,343
How far do we go?

342
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:06,465
To that, I dare not hazard an answer.

343
00:28:09,436 --> 00:28:11,770
Enjoy your evening, Mr. Chandler.

344
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,925
I suppose we could get
him some very rare meat.

345
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,262
Or scraps from the butcher's yard,

346
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:39,380
or even the slaughterhouse.

347
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:26,442
Oh, Ethan, I've wanted
to come here forever.

348
00:29:26,476 --> 00:29:28,477
Monstrous little horrors they enact.

349
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,313
Say it like that and you
can get me to do anything.

350
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:31,614
- What?
- "Eatin'."

351
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:33,182
Shut up.

352
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,126
Miss Croft.

353
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:19,660
Five minutes.

354
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:21,562
Five minutes.

355
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:57,130
Let us murder the people tonight.

356
00:31:16,517 --> 00:31:18,951
Travelers all to a sacred place,

357
00:31:18,985 --> 00:31:22,121
indulge with us our act of grace.

358
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:25,024
Presented for you a theatrical feast,

359
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:26,959
which we have entitled

360
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:29,529
The Transformed Beast!

361
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:50,348
Beautiful!

362
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,284
Oh, she's so pretty.

363
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,969
And so are you.

364
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:03,127
In sylvan grove I await my love,

365
00:32:03,162 --> 00:32:05,930
who calls me yet his gentle dove.

366
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,499
Innocent am I and only 15...

367
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:09,633
Eh oop!

368
00:32:09,668 --> 00:32:12,903
unschooled in the ways
of all things obscene.

369
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:14,705
Not for long!

370
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:31,889
Truest love, my most adored,

371
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:34,992
I speak this night of things abhorred.

372
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:37,728
Of evil spirits and fortunes cursed,

373
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:42,332
of blackest night and things far worst.

374
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:45,235
When raven crows and adder hisses,

375
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:48,038
'tis no time for Cupid's kisses.

376
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:51,208
On nights so dreary black and bleak,

377
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:54,211
perforce of villainy must we speak.

378
00:32:54,245 --> 00:32:56,313
But fear thee not, beloved youth,

379
00:32:56,347 --> 00:32:59,816
for we shall surmount all things uncouth.

380
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:03,453
Our deepest love, our fulsome ardor,

381
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,855
now must survive a test much harder,

382
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,691
than any two lovers did hence endure,

383
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:12,596
a test of faith both dire and

384
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:14,264
obscure.

385
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:24,407
But surely love is supernatural,

386
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:27,810
a secret urge and not quite factual.

387
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:31,480
A longing so deep and dark and rare,

388
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:35,217
that only such as we can share.

389
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,692
Was she right, Miss Ives,

390
00:33:42,726 --> 00:33:44,661
that you're not actually going to Africa?

391
00:33:44,695 --> 00:33:48,665
Would my house be full of
cartographic equipment if I were not?

392
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:49,731
When do you head off?

393
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,000
A matter of a few months.

394
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:54,436
I have to attend to some final details.

395
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,005
Like selecting your traveling companions?

396
00:33:58,074 --> 00:33:59,975
Are you jealous, Doctor?

397
00:34:01,077 --> 00:34:03,244
I'm not surprised, certainly.

398
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:07,348
I've never been valued for my athleticism.

399
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:09,976
That was always the sphere of my brothers.

400
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,187
From time to time, though,

401
00:34:12,221 --> 00:34:14,690
one would like to be thought of as capable.

402
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,160
I lost a son in Africa.

403
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:22,562
He was much like you in a way.

404
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,434
Mr. Chandler means nothing to me.

405
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:29,736
He is a finger on a trigger.

406
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,973
You are not.

407
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,522
♪ Cold blows the wind ♪

408
00:34:50,158 --> 00:34:53,293
♪ To my true love ♪

409
00:34:53,328 --> 00:35:00,734
♪ And gently drops the rain ♪

410
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:06,572
♪ I never had but... ♪

411
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:12,212
Master.

412
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,699
Ah, the tempest sounds
close round our ears,

413
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:35,502
and swifter ever the demon nears.

414
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:38,204
I fight with manly fortitude,

415
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:41,240
my spirit still would love exude,

416
00:35:41,275 --> 00:35:43,742
but there grows within a mighty beast,

417
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:49,081
that strains and yearns for quick release!

418
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:52,218
My gentle love, my only charm,

419
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:54,453
your anguish I would soon disarm.

420
00:35:54,488 --> 00:35:56,389
There cannot be a happy end,

421
00:35:56,423 --> 00:36:00,593
for claw will slash and tooth will rend.

422
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:03,596
But to me you can no harm intend.

423
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:07,233
I am your one devoted friend.

424
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:10,002
Inside my skin crawls such a humor,

425
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:12,905
I cannot credit it as something human.

426
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:15,908
Instead a fire grows deep within me

427
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:19,812
that burns and roils and leaps for thee.

428
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:23,348
How can I contain such Promethean flame?

429
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,585
How can I ever this demon tame?

430
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,655
Our time is up.

431
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,457
Our love is dead.

432
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,193
God's nowhere near,

433
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:36,728
for the beast is here!

434
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:46,996
Oh, my God.

435
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,376
Oh!

436
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:53,911
My knees can't take this fucking play.

437
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,189
Excellent!

438
00:37:47,532 --> 00:37:48,666
Ladies and gentlemen,

439
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,335
the next act will begin in 15 minutes.

440
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,953
I thought Miss Ives had gone out.

441
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:12,271
She has.

442
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:14,457
Your man then?

443
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,261
Sembene is off tonight.

444
00:39:19,822 --> 00:39:21,656
She's not here, Master.

445
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,389
Mother?

446
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,067
No, no, no, it's always been that way.

447
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,169
Next week, I'll be out at sea.

448
00:40:09,203 --> 00:40:10,837
Brandy, please.

449
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:12,556
Thank you.

450
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:21,565
Mr. Chandler.

451
00:40:22,517 --> 00:40:24,718
Miss Ives, what a pleasure.

452
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:27,054
This is Miss Brona Croft.

453
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,323
Brona, Miss Vanessa Ives.

454
00:40:29,357 --> 00:40:31,158
How do you do, Miss Croft?

455
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:32,259
Ma'am.

456
00:40:32,293 --> 00:40:35,195
So lovely to meet you at last.

457
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,597
I suppose I shouldn't be
surprised to see you here,

458
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:39,333
being a man of the theater yourself.

459
00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:41,901
Miss Ives.

460
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:45,339
I knew you'd find me.

461
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:47,207
Or did you find me?

462
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:49,709
Hello, I'm Dorian Gray.

463
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:50,844
Ethan Chandler.

464
00:40:50,878 --> 00:40:52,212
This is Miss Brona Croft.

465
00:40:52,246 --> 00:40:53,280
Hello.

466
00:40:53,314 --> 00:40:56,583
Oh. We've met, I believe.

467
00:40:57,452 --> 00:40:59,118
Meet so many people, don't you?

468
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,619
How do you like the show?

469
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:01,887
It's thrilling.

470
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:03,789
There's nothing like the theater, is there?

471
00:41:03,823 --> 00:41:05,491
If you like illusion.

472
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:06,925
And apparently declamation.

473
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,994
You're a fine one

474
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:09,895
to speak of declamation, Mr. Chandler.

475
00:41:09,929 --> 00:41:12,865
When we met, you were tearing
a bit of a passion yourself.

476
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,700
Are you an actor?

477
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,869
I was a sharpshooter in a Wild West show.

478
00:41:16,903 --> 00:41:18,971
That hardly does you justice.

479
00:41:19,006 --> 00:41:20,339
Henry Irving himself

480
00:41:20,374 --> 00:41:23,109
cannot reach your heights
of rhetorical flourish.

481
00:41:24,243 --> 00:41:26,177
Excuse me, I need some air.

482
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:29,347
Excuse us.

483
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:34,452
Brona.

484
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:37,472
What's going on?

485
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:40,325
Don't you worry about me.

486
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:41,692
Are you all right?

487
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:44,362
Go on to your friends, now, won't you?

488
00:41:44,397 --> 00:41:45,430
And if she's your kind of lady,

489
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,398
you can bloody well enjoy her!

490
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:50,218
Let's just go home.

491
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,337
It's a sad spectacle, Ethan,

492
00:41:53,371 --> 00:41:55,606
why don't we just admit it?

493
00:41:57,308 --> 00:41:58,442
Brona, please.

494
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:02,413
You're fucking a skeleton
every night, for Christ's sake.

495
00:42:02,447 --> 00:42:06,283
There's no goddamn future
in it for either of us.

496
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:07,384
Who are we trying to fool?

497
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,885
You want to watch me die?

498
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,387
Fuck, no.

499
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:16,427
Go on, go on! Go in to
your lady friend now,

500
00:42:16,461 --> 00:42:18,429
and have one of your clever chats, you two.

501
00:42:18,463 --> 00:42:20,164
Wake up, son.

502
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,670
From now on,

503
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:29,172
you fuck me like anyone else,

504
00:42:30,608 --> 00:42:32,575
after you've paid.

505
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:47,757
Mr. Chandler.

506
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:49,859
The next act is about to begin.

507
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,395
Mr. Chandler?

508
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:57,133
Are you all right?

509
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,653
You ever wish you could be someone else?

510
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:03,589
Just run away from your life?

511
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:06,693
All the time.

512
00:43:10,313 --> 00:43:12,464
You want to be someone else?

513
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,217
Come with me.

514
00:43:17,654 --> 00:43:19,221
Does it involve a drink?

515
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:21,756
- Many.
- What about Miss Ives?

516
00:43:22,659 --> 00:43:25,144
She doesn't want to be anyone else.

517
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,633
You're on, Mr. Gray.

518
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:41,777
Lovely.

519
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:43,846
After you. We've got all night.

520
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:04,824
I should warn you. This
is not completely legal.

521
00:45:05,259 --> 00:45:07,192
Not my first time.

522
00:45:43,964 --> 00:45:45,997
Fifty here!

523
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,234
Fifty-seven!

524
00:45:53,173 --> 00:45:54,573
Write it down.

525
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:57,509
Eighty-seven!

526
00:45:57,543 --> 00:45:59,211
Eighty-nine, please!

527
00:46:00,346 --> 00:46:02,381
- One-hundred and three!
- Thank you!

528
00:46:02,415 --> 00:46:03,615
Forty-eight!

529
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:06,819
Seventy!

530
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:09,788
Twenty-four!

531
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:12,424
Oh!

532
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,044
One-hundred and three!
One-hundred and three!

533
00:46:33,078 --> 00:46:34,780
That's Flash Jack.

534
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:36,348
The best there is.

535
00:46:36,382 --> 00:46:37,549
A true artist at it.

536
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:40,952
Once killed 120 rats in
six minutes, 10 seconds.

537
00:46:41,386 --> 00:46:42,787
Flash Jack, 74!

538
00:46:42,821 --> 00:46:44,554
May I have 97?

539
00:46:56,635 --> 00:46:57,668
Let's get on with it.

540
00:46:57,703 --> 00:46:59,269
He won last week. He's a good dog.

541
00:47:01,973 --> 00:47:03,140
Fifty-five, on the money.

542
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:14,551
Go on. Go on.

543
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:18,422
Yeah!

544
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:25,628
Yeah!

545
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,201
Go! Go! Go!

546
00:47:51,021 --> 00:47:52,521
Excuse me.

547
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:01,297
Whiskey.

548
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,634
Not your sort of thing, is it?

549
00:48:06,604 --> 00:48:08,738
I say, I was speaking to you.

550
00:48:08,773 --> 00:48:10,373
Don't talk to me.

551
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:12,641
Oh. American.

552
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:16,712
Well, perhaps you don't
understand gentlemen's sport.

553
00:48:16,746 --> 00:48:18,214
You're in Britain now.

554
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:21,049
We do things like we like, you hear?

555
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:24,553
Answer him, you rude thing.

556
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:31,427
Don't touch me.

557
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:34,563
Answer him, you rude thing.

558
00:48:40,938 --> 00:48:42,804
Come on, Jack! Go!

559
00:49:00,522 --> 00:49:02,072
I'm awfully sorry.

560
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,291
I have a temper.

561
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:05,592
Mmm.

562
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,227
I won, by the way.

563
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:08,896
Flash Jack.

564
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,764
Ninety-seven on the nose.

565
00:49:11,432 --> 00:49:13,400
Not that it matters.

566
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:15,769
Why not?

567
00:49:15,804 --> 00:49:17,671
It's not as diverting as it used to be.

568
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,639
Once you get used to something, why bother?

569
00:49:19,673 --> 00:49:22,274
It's just repetition.

570
00:49:22,409 --> 00:49:24,576
You like your cologne.

571
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,846
How do you choose?

572
00:49:27,615 --> 00:49:29,849
Depends on how I feel.

573
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,785
Or how I want to feel, I suppose.

574
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,188
Different aromas make you
feel differently, don't they?

575
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,125
Citrus and sandalwood produce one feeling.

576
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:41,460
Musk and lavender another.

577
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:42,762
Citron.

578
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,731
Jasmine, mint.

579
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:47,466
Each produces a different sensation.

580
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,400
A different you.

581
00:49:51,604 --> 00:49:53,538
I get carried away.

582
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:56,641
Good for you.

583
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,931
Do you like pictures?

584
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:26,371
Mostly the ones of the buxom
ladies that hang above saloon bars.

585
00:50:28,307 --> 00:50:31,042
You play your part to
perfection, Mr. Chandler.

586
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:32,243
What part's that?

587
00:50:32,278 --> 00:50:34,211
Rude, mechanical.

588
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:36,246
Rugged Westerner.

589
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,684
But I suppose we all play parts.

590
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,620
What's yours?

591
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:45,356
Human.

592
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:54,264
Do you know absinthe?

593
00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:56,667
Never had the pleasure.

594
00:50:56,702 --> 00:50:59,270
Then we shall toast your first taste.

595
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,226
To the most mysterious thing in London...

596
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:09,213
Miss Vanessa Ives.

597
00:51:38,276 --> 00:51:40,076
What's happened?

598
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:44,548
It was here.

599
00:51:47,585 --> 00:51:49,319
It came here?

600
00:51:49,354 --> 00:51:50,687
And the boy is dead.

601
00:51:50,721 --> 00:51:52,922
It came after him?

602
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:55,408
The creature was in your room.

603
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,527
It came after you.

604
00:52:01,632 --> 00:52:03,299
I think it was all a ploy.

605
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:07,303
Allowing us to capture
him, bringing him here.

606
00:52:07,337 --> 00:52:10,072
We practically invited it in, didn't we?

607
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:12,074
But it was Mina who led me to him.

608
00:52:12,108 --> 00:52:14,777
Suggesting what, Vanessa?

609
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:16,987
That...

610
00:52:17,981 --> 00:52:21,916
Mina is manipulating me.

611
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,687
That she may be beyond our help.

612
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:27,105
That she may be your enemy.

613
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,759
Can you blame her?

614
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:33,529
I'm not the only one in this house

615
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:34,997
she has a reason to hate.

616
00:52:35,031 --> 00:52:37,466
I betrayed your daughter once.

617
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:40,168
You ignored her your entire life.

618
00:52:40,203 --> 00:52:42,003
So have the courage to face your own sin

619
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:44,388
before you cite mine so easily.

620
00:52:46,008 --> 00:52:47,642
There are times when I wish

621
00:52:47,677 --> 00:52:51,412
Mina had been born with your cruel spirit.

622
00:52:56,686 --> 00:52:59,020
You're the daughter I deserve.

623
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:09,330
So, we'll carry on with this fight.

624
00:53:10,466 --> 00:53:13,367
We can lose every battle, except the last.

625
00:53:25,347 --> 00:53:27,264
Do you have a favorite?

626
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,451
I do.

627
00:53:30,985 --> 00:53:33,053
But it's not in here.

628
00:53:33,988 --> 00:53:37,991
I've seen some pictures
I like a lot actually.

629
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,611
I don't know if they count.

630
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:47,400
There's an Anasazi village in Colorado.

631
00:53:48,636 --> 00:53:52,122
This was an Indian tribe
that died out a long time ago.

632
00:53:54,408 --> 00:53:59,279
They build this town up the side
of the mountain, in the cliffs.

633
00:54:02,516 --> 00:54:04,284
There are some paintings
they left on the walls

634
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:06,386
from thousands of years ago.

635
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:09,489
No people.

636
00:54:10,224 --> 00:54:11,991
Just animals.

637
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,527
The sun.

638
00:54:15,897 --> 00:54:17,464
The moon.

639
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:22,802
Whatever they thought
important enough to, uh...

640
00:54:24,738 --> 00:54:26,305
remember.

641
00:54:30,711 --> 00:54:32,612
Why do you like them?

642
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:35,615
They're primitive.

643
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,217
No.

644
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:42,354
They're honest.

645
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:46,492
Can art be honest?

646
00:54:50,664 --> 00:54:52,682
You're the expert there.

647
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:56,703
I think music can.

648
00:54:56,737 --> 00:54:58,671
Perhaps only music, because

649
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:01,773
it's ephemeral.

650
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:03,742
That's the paradox. Music is a phantasm,

651
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:06,444
but it's true.

652
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,613
You know your music, too.

653
00:55:08,648 --> 00:55:11,649
Oh, I'm bored with them.

654
00:55:13,586 --> 00:55:16,054
I know every groove of every cylinder.

655
00:55:18,624 --> 00:55:20,391
There's nothing new.

656
00:55:22,995 --> 00:55:24,863
There is one though.

657
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:29,200
I would ask if you know Wagner,

658
00:55:29,235 --> 00:55:31,068
but you'd only pretend you don't.

659
00:55:36,675 --> 00:55:38,242
It's the Liebestod

660
00:55:38,677 --> 00:55:40,978
from Tristan und Isolde.

661
00:55:41,813 --> 00:55:45,715
Literally translated,
it means "love-death."

662
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:54,925
This is the very end of the opera.

663
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:57,461
Isolde's lover is dead before her.

664
00:55:59,497 --> 00:56:01,498
They're on a beach.

665
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:05,067
The waves are rolling in and out.

666
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:07,654
You can hear that in the music, can't you?

667
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,841
And her heartbreak, you can hear that.

668
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:59,420
Stop it!

669
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:26,650
