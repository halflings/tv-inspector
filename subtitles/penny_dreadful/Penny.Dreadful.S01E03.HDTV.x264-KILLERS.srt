She was working as a governess

influenced her behavior...

397
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:55,113
and now she has become his slave,

(SNARLING)

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,880
(GROANING)

502
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:09,648
(LAPPING)

503
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,886
Where is your master?

504
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,356
Right behind you.

505
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,927
Don't you feel him in the dark?

506
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:25,830
On the back of your neck,

507
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:28,400
his breath.

508
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,803
(EXHALES) Now one finger reaching out.

509
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,607
Do you not feel it?

510
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,443
Well, you soon will.

511
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:40,279
And then...

512
00:39:40,313 --> 00:39:41,863
And then...

513
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,616
All light will end

514
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,018
and the world will live in darkness.

515
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,489
The Hidden Ones will emerge and rule...

516
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:54,592
Amunet.

517
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,996
Amun-Ra.

518
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,638
Do you know the name Mina?

519
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:08,606
FENTON: I know the name Vanessa.

520
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:10,024
Naughty girl.

521
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,444
Mother will punish you,

522
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:14,829
you cock-sucking whore.

523
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,482
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

524
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,985
- Where is your master?
- Hold on.

525
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,754
Will you beat me, Mother?

526
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,556
Have I been naughty?

527
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,825
I only wanna eat, like all poor creatures.

528
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,460
I am so hungry!

529
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:31,262
Ahh!

530
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,864
SIR MALCOLM: Where is your master?

531
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:34,232
Everywhere.

532
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,367
Where is your master?

533
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,969
I'm so hungry.

534
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:39,236
(GROANS LOUDLY)

535
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,238
Where is your master?

536
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,774
(FENTON WHIMPERING)

537
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:46,778
FRANKENSTEIN: Oh.

538
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:50,214
I'm late to the party.

539
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,817
SIR MALCOLM: He's the first
real connection we have to Mina.

540
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:55,652
It is an invaluable opportunity
we cannot afford to waste.

541
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:57,621
Even if it means beating him to death?

542
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,156
Suddenly sentimental about
bloodletting, Mr. Chandler?

543
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,225
Maybe I don't take to torturing children.

544
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,461
FRANKENSTEIN: Killing
redskins more your line?

545
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:05,796
You know nothing about it.

546
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,999
Whole Indian nations pacified into
nonexistence, what don't I know?

547
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,666
How do you know I was in the Indian wars?

548
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,085
I didn't.

549
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,072
Gentlemen, the matter at hand...

550
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:19,109
SIR MALCOLM: Doctor?

551
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,311
FRANKENSTEIN: As a subject, he's promising.

552
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:24,581
If you seek a cure, you'll need
a subject for experimentation.

553
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,216
A cure for what?

554
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,651
I'll have to make a proper examination,

555
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,987
but I would think the
disorder is not mental,

556
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,855
the physiological symptoms are too marked.

557
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:34,023
I would begin treatment as if it were, say,

558
00:41:34,057 --> 00:41:37,126
Dengue fever or one of the
other rare blood disorders.

559
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,560
Perhaps transfusion.

560
00:41:38,595 --> 00:41:39,929
To what end?

561
00:41:39,963 --> 00:41:41,497
Removing the toxins from his system

562
00:41:41,531 --> 00:41:44,166
and seeing if there are any improvements.

563
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,501
It may be a way to treat your daughter

564
00:41:45,535 --> 00:41:47,402
if she is similarly afflicted.

565
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:48,938
The whole thing's steeped in blood,

566
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,605
so why not start there?

567
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,875
Why not?

568
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,476
You've got a kid chained
up in your basement

569
00:41:54,511 --> 00:41:55,778
and you're talking about
experimenting on him

570
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:56,846
like he's some kind of rat,

571
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,981
when you're not talking
about torturing him.

572
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,800
Then leave this house.

573
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:08,691
We here have been brutalized with loss.

574
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:11,127
It has made us brutal in return.

575
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,564
There is no going back from this moment.

576
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:22,503
If we are to proceed, we proceed as one.

577
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,556
Without hesitation...

578
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:29,543
and with fealty to each other alone.

579
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:33,047
This, we seek, demands nothing less.

580
00:42:35,051 --> 00:42:37,351
It is not for the weak or the kind.

581
00:42:37,653 --> 00:42:39,888
No one in this room is kind.

582
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:42,423
That's why you're here.

583
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:46,561
Now look into each other's eyes.

584
00:42:46,595 --> 00:42:49,664
And pledge to go as far
as your soul will allow.

585
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:56,721
Swear it now.

586
00:43:21,396 --> 00:43:23,764
Give your assent, Mr. Chandler,

587
00:43:23,798 --> 00:43:26,751
or leave this company
and its mysteries behind.

588
00:43:35,644 --> 00:43:37,211
I'm with you.

589
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:41,348
And I with you, Ethan.

590
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:49,222
And since we're compacted,

591
00:43:49,257 --> 00:43:50,490
I have a question.

592
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:53,360
Tonight, in the zoo,

593
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,112
Mina was not there.

594
00:43:56,997 --> 00:43:58,598
- Did you know?
- I feared.

595
00:43:58,633 --> 00:43:59,899
Why?

596
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:02,302
Why?

597
00:44:02,336 --> 00:44:05,805
I think it's possible the
creature we seek doesn't want her.

598
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:06,939
He wants you.

599
00:44:10,144 --> 00:44:11,978
- For what purpose?
- I don't know.

600
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,045
Tell me.

601
00:44:14,181 --> 00:44:15,982
(SIGHS)

602
00:44:16,016 --> 00:44:18,050
- Tell me.
- I don't know.

603
00:44:22,155 --> 00:44:23,355
So I was bait?

604
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,490
Yes.

605
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:32,331
ETHAN: I took a room at the Mariner's Inn

606
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:34,433
on the other side of the river.

607
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:37,135
Why there of all places?

608
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,170
Mmm.

609
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:45,043
What's her name?

610
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,815
Brona.

611
00:44:52,018 --> 00:44:54,652
It means "sadness" in Gaelic.

612
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:56,754
Does she live up to the name?

613
00:44:58,490 --> 00:44:59,891
I can't tell.

614
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:04,930
She has consumption.

615
00:45:07,066 --> 00:45:08,583
Then she will.

616
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:12,603
Who doesn't love a lost cause?

617
00:45:16,108 --> 00:45:18,210
I've spoken to the
hematologist I mentioned before.

618
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:20,378
He's short of funds so
he'll consult with us.

619
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:22,080
Pretty sort of doctors we are,

620
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:23,849
bartering our services like this.

621
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,951
- So you'll come tomorrow?
- Yes.

622
00:45:25,985 --> 00:45:27,452
And I'll bring supplies
for the transfusion.

623
00:45:27,486 --> 00:45:29,554
- You will have money for me?
- Yes.

624
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,824
There is one thing you need to consider.

625
00:45:35,126 --> 00:45:36,594
When you transform a life,

626
00:45:36,628 --> 00:45:38,796
you're making it anew.

627
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:40,732
Whatever happens to
that creature downstairs,

628
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:43,000
we are responsible for it.

629
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,752
It is our burden now.

630
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:49,340
Every action builds another
link that binds us to it.

631
00:45:50,876 --> 00:45:53,002
That chain is everlasting.

632
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:58,132
Work tomorrow, Doctor. Get some sleep.

633
00:46:00,952 --> 00:46:03,053
Who can survive the dreams?
