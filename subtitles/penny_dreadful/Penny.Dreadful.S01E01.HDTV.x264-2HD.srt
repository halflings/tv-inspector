Just about then...

56
00:05:49,936 --> 00:05:52,699
I seen big old Crazy Horse himself,

57
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,266

(Crowd laughs and whistles)

64
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:13,699
General Custer gave the word,

65
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,699
his blond hair flapping in the breeze

66
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,632
like something from myth.

67
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:23,899
Says he: "Stand here and fight, boys,
fight for your very lives!"

68
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,266
(Applause and cheering)

69
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,732

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,666
One of the few survivors who lived

74
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:38,066
to bring you this tale
of pluck and daring.

75
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:41,400
(Applause and cheering)

76
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,483
(Festive music starts)

77
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:46,032
Thanks for coming out today

78
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:48,899
and I hope that I have found
some favor among you

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,666
estimable gentlemen...and ladies.

80
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,999

83
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:05,333
YOUNG WOMAN:
(Moaning and gasping)

84
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:08,017
Yeah!

85
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:09,066
(Moaning and gasping)

86
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,184
(Grunting and gasping)

87
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:11,299
Yeah!

88
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,567
(Moaning and gasping)

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
(Grunting and gasping)

90
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,632
YOUNG WOMAN:
Will I see you again?

91
00:07:22,633 --> 00:07:24,267
(Under his breath)
No.

92
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,066
Would that I could.
Show's heading off to Paris.

93
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,066
So many details to attend to...
You understand.

94
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,066
The life of a theatrical gentleman
is peripatetic, darlin'.

95
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,517
But I was under...

96
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:35,966
(Smothering kiss)

97
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:38,967
(Men chatter nearby,
church bells ring)

98
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,232
Just know that you have made
my visit here truly memorable.

99
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,967
I shall never forget you.

100
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:51,699
Perhaps you'd like to know
my name then.

101
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,732
(Amused snort)

102
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:55,999
(Glasses clink)

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(Footsteps scuff, low hum of chatter)

104
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,517
__

105
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,332
WOMAN:
You didn't tell the truth.

106
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:11,632
By my reckoning, you were a boy
when General Custer died

107
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:14,099
and 'tis well known
there were no survivors.

108
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,132
ETHAN:
What we call a tall tale, darlin'.

109
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,567
WOMAN:
Exceedingly tall.

110
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,866
ETHAN: Vice of my nation.
We're storytellers.

111
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,233
Join me, won't you?

112
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,766
You saw my exhibition?

113
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,966
Highly impressive,
especially your finale.

114
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,667
ETHAN: Well, you gotta leave them
wanting more,

115
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,900
as we say in show business.

116
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,932
And what might I do for you?

117
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:43,367
- I have a need for some night work.
- Oh, honey, don't we all?

118
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,699
I have a need for a gentleman
who's comfortable with firearms

119
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,699
and not hesitant to engage
in dangerous endeavors

120
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,632
or was all that a tall tale as well?

121
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,633
What do you think?

122
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:02,066
Expensive watch,
but threadbare jacket.

123
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,932
Sentimental about the money
you used to have.

124
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:08,766
Your eye is steady,
but your left hand tremors.

125
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:09,932
That's the drink,

126
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:13,199
so you keep it below the table,
hoping I won't notice.

127
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,066
You have a contusion healing
on your other hand,

128
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:20,332
the result of a recent brawl
with a jealous husband, no doubt.

129
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:25,332
Your boots are good quality leather,
but have been resoled more than once.

130
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,866
I see a man who's been
accustomed to wealth,

131
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:30,932
but has given himself to excess

132
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:33,799
and the unbridled pleasures of youth.

133
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,416
A man much more complicated

134
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,833
than he likes to appear.

135
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,166
So, it's a job, this "night work?"

136
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,266
Yes.

137
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,666
Something of a criminal setup?

138
00:09:54,667 --> 00:09:56,032
Would it matter?

139
00:09:56,033 --> 00:09:58,366
- Not at all.
- Then why ask?

140
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,490
Show's heading off to Paris,
pretty soon.

141
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,142
The job's tonight.

142
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:05,067
- Is it a murder?
- Would it matter?

143
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,300
One smile and I say yes.

144
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,767
Meet me at this address
at eleven o'clock.

145
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,966
- I don't know London.
- Then ask a policeman.

146
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,166
You have a name?

147
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,168
WOMAN:
Yes.

148
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:33,066
(Loud buzz of chatter in the streets)

149
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,850
BOY:
Clear off, Johnny!

150
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,633
(Horse whinnies)

151
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,133
(Baby wails)

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,932
Mr. Chandler.

153
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:53,533
I didn't expect you to be on time.

154
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,466
Oh, I never keep a lady waiting.

155
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,366
WOMAN:
Very wise. This way please.

156
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:04,100
(Footsteps clack, cat meows nearby)

157
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:08,299
(Knocks on door)

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,700
(Door clanks open)

159
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:13,100
(Footsteps echo)

160
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,433
(Door slams shut)

161
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:26,367
(Chime tinkles, voices murmur quietly)

162
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:37,500
(Light ringing sound, flame sizzles)

163
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
(Puffing)

164
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:50,567
(Voices murmur quietly,
someone coughs)

165
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,433
(Approaching footsteps)

166
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,366
- This is the individual?
- Yes.

167
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,933
Did you bring your weapons?

168
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:19,999
ETHAN:
One-one minute.

169
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:23,440
What're we doing here?

170
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:24,700
SIR MALCOLM:
We're looking for someone.

171
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,299
More than that,
you don't need to know.

172
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,099
Do not be amazed at anything you see

173
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,100
and don't hesitate.

174
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,300
(Footsteps echo)

175
00:12:43,967 --> 00:12:46,599
ETHAN:
Who exactly are we looking for?

176
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,166
Someone very dear to me
who's been taken.

177

Where is she?

215
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:01,833
Little girls shouldn't play
with toys like that.

216
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,267
WOMAN:
Where is your master?

217
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,884
Closer than you think.

She's not here.

OLDER GENTLEMAN:
There must be another.

WOMAN:
Another creature?

241
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,367
OLDER GENTLEMAN:
Is there another?

242
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,632
Is there another creature like that?

243
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:41,983
SOMNOLENT WOMAN:
(Hisses)

244
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:43,332
ETHAN:
Jesus Christ!

245
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't move, Mr. Chandler.
This night's not over.

246
00:17:46,081 --> 00:17:47,999
Help us, please.

247
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,532

and fill the night)

250
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:05,500
(Squishy, gelatinous sound)

251
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,267
ETHAN:
What is this place?

252
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,566
Where the resurrection men
ply their trade.

253
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,266
The surgeons must supply their
students with ample subjects.

254
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,700
When the legal channels
are exhausted,

255
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:18,266
they're forced to resort
to other means.

256
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:19,924
I'm in need of your services, sir.

257
00:18:19,925 --> 00:18:21,000
PROPRIETOR:
Tisn't from the river?

258
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:22,767
They're useless
once them fishes got 'em.

259
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,932
Not the river, no.

260
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:25,600
PROPRIETOR:
Well, that's a blessing.

261
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:28,933
Bring it round the back and see
if my assistant can take you.

262
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:39,800
(Cart rattles)

263
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,332
OLDER GENTLEMAN:
Your master said you might assist us.

264
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,667
YOUNG DOCTOR:
I have no master.

265
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,067
OLDER GENTLEMAN:
The proprietor out front, I mean.

266
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,233
- Go away.
- I'll pay you for your time.

267
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:53,932
- You'd not afford it.
- You're very proud.

268
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,933
Take it to a slaughterhouse.
I'm not a medical practitioner.

269
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,399
I'm engaged in research.

270
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,366
ETHAN: You're a man with a bloody knife
like everybody else out there,

271
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:02,699
so stop putting on airs.

272
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,967
American?

273
00:19:03,968 --> 00:19:05,232
ETHAN:
You are clever.

274
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,200
Do you know anything
about electrical currents?

275
00:19:07,203 --> 00:19:08,500
Your country is making such strides

276
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:11,332
as we labor in the dark ages
of coal and peat.

277
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,633
Have you any experience
with the principles

278
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,932
and applications of galvanism?

279
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,366
Oh, the usual.

280
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:19,332
Sir, I have urgent need of an necropsy.
Will you assist us?

281
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,932
I am occupied solely in research.

282
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,702
I will not bore myself
with explanations

283
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,054
you could not possibly understand.

284
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:28,333
Now, kindly, stop wasting
my time and get out!

285
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,667
(Footsteps echo lightly)

286
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,932
(Tool clatters)

287
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,167
(Shocked whisper)
My God.

288
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,517
Lividity, null.

289
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,799
Rigor mortis, null.

290
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Notable ocular hyperemia.

291
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:52,799
Ocular reaction, null.

292
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,332
Dental malformation,

293
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,466
not naturally occurring
due to the isotropy.

294
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:57,984
Nature's rarely so neat.

295
00:19:57,985 --> 00:19:59,499
Nature abhors symmetry.

296
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,167
Trauma and penetration
of the chest cavity

297
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,278
through the manubrium
seems the likely cause of death,

298
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,432
but I expect you know that.

299
00:20:05,433 --> 00:20:08,432
Age of the subject
is impossible to determine.

300
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:11,917
The teeth seem barely used,
which seems unlikely given the...

301
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,700
muscular development.

302
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,566
The dermis is unusual.

303
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,550
Seems to lack the normal
cutaneous eccrine pores.

304
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:21,467
Hand me that.

305
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:31,432
(Slicing, cracking sound)

306
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:34,766
Well, I know why
the skin seems peculiar.

307
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:35,800
OLDER GENTLEMAN:
Why?

308
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:36,832
Forceps.

309
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,833
Because it isn't skin.

310
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:40,832
Not as we know it.

311
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,883
It's more like a...

312
00:20:42,884 --> 00:20:44,932
tensile exoskeleton,

313
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,933
along the lines of an insect
or crustacean.

314
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:48,867
He must have been a hearty devil.

315
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,966
ETHAN:
You're not kidding.

316
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,900
Hold on, what's this?

317
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,666
Fascinating.

318
00:20:57,667 --> 00:20:59,832
Hieroglyphics.

319
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,767
YOUNG DOCTOR:
Egyptian?

320
00:21:01,768 --> 00:21:03,700
OLDER GENTLEMAN:
Undoubtedly.

321
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,867
Well, it would appear

322
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:08,633
you have an Egyptian man
of no particular age,

323
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,400
who, at some point
in his indeterminate lifespan,

324
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,467
decided to sharpen his teeth,
cover himself in hieroglyphics

325
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,932
and grow an exoskeleton.

326
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,933
Or you have something else altogether.

327
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,033
Who the fuck are you people?

328
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,466
Do you know Grandage Place
in Westminster?

329
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:29,632

Even her?

GALSWORTHY:
Especially her.

347
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,125
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Doesn't seem right.

348

Where's the dignity in that?

(Constable vomits)

ETHAN:
No thanks.

374
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,332

Rapping on the table?
Voices from the great beyond?

Not precisely.

379
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,332
You're a skeptic.

380
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,021
ETHAN:
Not about everything.

381
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:30,132
Last night, for example.

382
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:33,099
And you want an explanation?

383
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
I think I should see Sir Malcolm.

384
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:42,400
I can speak for him.

385
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:48,099
Do you believe there is
a demimonde, Mr. Chandler?

386
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,299
A half world between
what we know and what we fear?

387
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,732
A place in the shadows,
rarely seen, but deeply felt.

388
00:24:57,733 --> 00:25:00,966
Do you believe that?

389
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,300
Yes.

390
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,766
That's where we were last night,

391
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,666
where some unfortunate souls
are cursed to live always.

392
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:16,666
If you believe in curses, that is.

393
00:25:16,667 --> 00:25:19,333
(Cards rasp)

394
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:26,832
Are you a wise man, Mr. Chandler?

395
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,232
Not especially.

396
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:30,133
A wise man would walk away
from this house

397
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:34,266
and make a concerted effort to forget
everything that occurred last night.

398
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,732
He would not look back.

399
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,166
That sounds like a warning.

400
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:39,899
It's an invitation.

401
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,966
Should you be so unwise
as to entertain the idea,

402
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,832
we have continued use
of a man of your skills.

403
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:46,999
Your kind of man.

404
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,200
ETHAN:
And what kind is that?

405
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:52,399
VANESSA: One of great violence
and hidden depths.

406
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,699
You play your role well,
Mr. Chandler,

407
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,700
but this is not who you are.

408
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,333
Tell me what this is all about.

409
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:09,732
Sir Malcolm's daughter
was taken by a creature

410
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:12,199
such as the one we killed.

411
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,099
We didn't suspect there was another.

412
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,399
There's much we don't know
and must discover.

413
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,832
ETHAN:
And what's your part in all this?

414
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,333
My part is my own.

415
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:33,199
I've been a hired gun before.

416
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,766
Doesn't suit me.

417
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:37,999
There's no exaltation
in killing for gold.

418
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,832
A wise man after all.

419
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,832
Sembene has your money at the door.
He'll show you out.

420
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,833
I hope you enjoy your life
as an actor.

421
00:26:45,836 --> 00:26:48,299
It seems to be what you're suited for.

422
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,766
But if you find yourself
in that demimonde we spoke of,

423
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:56,366
and seek to escape it,

424
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:58,000
you know my address.

425
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:01,999
And what do you seek to escape?

426
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,766
Perhaps the same thing you do.

427
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:08,167
We all have our curses, don't we?

428
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,833
Good day, Mr. Chandler.

429
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,067
Miss Ives.

430
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,766
Before you go,

431
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,899
one last task, if you'll indulge me:

432
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,000
pick a card.

433
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:31,099
No, no, not like that.
Not impulsively, not without thought.

434
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,432
Let them work on you.

435
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,917
Look into my eyes.

436
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:38,400
Believe.

437
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:43,266

SIR MALCOLM:
Was he tempted?

443
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:18,433
VANESSA:
Intrigued, I would say.

444
00:28:18,436 --> 00:28:19,967
SIR MALCOLM:
Then he'll be back.

445
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:24,032
- He's intending to leave town.
- He won't. We won't let him.

446
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:26,650
I'll require you in an hour.

447
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:29,266
We have an appointment.

448
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:31,067
Where are we going?

449
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Amongst dead things.

450
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:40,800

462
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,966
I am extravagantly pleased.
Do show him in.

463
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,800
And stand up straight, Felix.

464
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,633
You look like an orangutan.

465

SIR MALCOLM:
Mr. Lyle.

466
00:29:28,084 --> 00:29:31,032
LYLE:
Sir Malcolm. Oh, it is you!

467
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,299
The photograph in your book
does you no justice, but do they ever?

468
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Say you'll inscribe it for me.
Say you will.

469
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,433
Your book, I mean.
And something deeply personal.

470
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:39,867
It would be a pleasure.

471
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:41,299
This is Miss Vanessa Ives.

472
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,099
Could I be more charmed?
No, I could not.

473
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,000
And what brings you
to the humble confines

474
00:29:47,003 --> 00:29:49,332
of the Department of Egyptian
and Assyrian Antiquities?

475
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:51,033
Though, really, it's only Egyptian.

476
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,432
We don't quite approve
the Assyrians, do we?

477
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:54,732
Sit down, do.

478
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,217
VANESSA:
What are these?

479
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:57,699
LYLE:
Oh, carrion beetles.

480
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,366
We employ them when the usual solvents
are deemed too abrasive.

481
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,532
They eat the flesh, don't you know.

482
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,132
Sorry, my dear, it's a bit
ghoulish to the lay-person.

483
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,432
Very exotic.
Where do they come from?

484
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,632
Actually, Waveney, in Suffolk.

485
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:14,332
VANESSA:
Not exotic at all.

486
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,232
SIR MALCOLM: Mr. Lyle, I was hoping
you could assist me.

487
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,633
I've a bit of hieroglyphics
in need of translating.

488
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:27,533
LYLE: These aren't from a scroll.
What are they?

489
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,567
They're from a tattoo on a corpse.

490
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:35,299
Oh, that's outre.

491
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,066
What have you got for me then?

492
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:39,632
Late hieratic script.

493
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:41,850
18th dynasty, perhaps earlier.

494
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:44,066
It's a standard funerary text.

495
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:46,700
(Agitated chirps,
wings beat furiously)

496
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,200
Conjoined in this fashion,
they translate roughly

497
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:55,032
to an idea meaning "blood cure"
or "blood transformation."

498
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,333
Although there's a theory
it's something

499
00:30:56,336 --> 00:30:58,599
more along the lines
of a malediction:

500
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,032
"A blood curse."

501
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,432
Trust me, those Egyptians
were a bit madcap

502
00:31:02,433 --> 00:31:06,133
when it came to specifics.
It's all very metaphoric.

503
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:11,133
(Ominous music plays)

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,367
- Are there more of these?
- Yes.

505
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:27,466
I should like to see them,
but not here.

506
00:31:27,467 --> 00:31:31,399
The British museum is no place
for actual scholarship, after all.

507
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,599
Perish the thought.

508
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,467
And before I engage
in professional matters,

509
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,699
I feel it is vital to engage
in social congress.

510
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,466
Get to know the sort of people
one is working with, you understand?

511
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:42,666
My wife and I entertain on occasion.

512
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,799
Lavishly, you can be sure,
as she's absurdly rich.

513
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,132
We're having a little fete,
Friday next.

514
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,567
Perhaps you and Miss Ives
could join us?

515
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,732
SIR MALCOLM:
This is a matter of some urgency.

516
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,600
Good heavens, Sir Malcolm,

517
00:31:53,603 --> 00:31:56,066
there hasn't been anything
urgent about the Egyptians

518
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,732
for 2000 years.

519
00:31:57,733 --> 00:32:01,066
And I'm dreadfully busy now,
you understand.

520
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:04,699
Ever so many papyri to translate.

521
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,967
Isn't that a delicious word?

522
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,232
Papyri.

523
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:12,499
Sounds like something eaten
by little Persian boys, doesn't it?

524
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,633
So I shall see you Friday next.

525
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:18,199
As you say.

526
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,266
LYLE:
Grand. It's resolved.

527
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,256
Bring the rest
of the photographs with you

528
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,702
and we'll take a peek.

529
00:32:23,803 --> 00:32:27,066
Entre nous, don't you know?

530
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,199
Such an infinite pleasure
meeting you both.

531
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,828
Our pleasure, Mr. Lyle.

532
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:32,300
Good day, good day.

533
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:35,300
I do assume you know
the source of the writing?

534
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,499
No.

535
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,700
It's from the Egyptian
Book of the Dead.

536
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:51,332
(Footsteps recede,
door clicks shut)

537
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:55,699
(Bell tolls, dog barks,
excited buzz of chatter)

538
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
(Baby wails)

539
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,732
CONSTABLE 1:
Keep clear.

540
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,733
(Low hum of chatter)

541
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:08,399
CONSTABLE:
Stay there.

542
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,232
WOMAN 1: Look at that blood.
Think they suffered much?

543
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:14,366
WOMAN 2: Bloody right, they did.
And that little girl too.

544
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,200
WOMAN 1: She was expecting another,
you know.

545
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:17,533
WOMAN 2:
Don't say it.

546
00:33:17,536 --> 00:33:20,144
WOMAN 1: Just starting to show.
Picking out names, she was.

547
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,700
WOMAN 2:
Is it the Ripper come back?

548
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,700
WOMAN 1:
Who else but old Jack?

549
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:27,566
WOMAN 2: Damn him that did it.
Right to hell.

550
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:31,866
(On-lookers chatter,
dog barks nearby)

551
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:35,867
(Street buzzes with chatter,
baby cries)

552
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:42,100
(Wagon rattles, hooves clop loudly)

553
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:46,466
(Horse snorts)

554
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:49,666
(Men groan and yell nearby)

555
00:33:49,667 --> 00:33:52,766
MAN:
I haven't seen him, Maud!

556
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:57,132
(Door slams heavily,
baby wails, people shout)

557
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:00,133
(Footsteps clomp loudly)

558
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
(Baby cries, man coughs,
low hum of chatter)

559
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,033
(Knocking)

560
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,899
(Loud knocking)

561
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,533
(Door creaks shut, locks latch)

562
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,766
(False door groans shut)

563
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,100
(Knocking)

564
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,132
(Door creaks open)

565
00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:33,333
A delivery for you.

566
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:35,533
From Sir Malcolm Murray.

567
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,767
(Door clunks shut)

568
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:49,633
(Dog barks outside)

569
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:59,922
__

570
00:35:00,123 --> 00:35:03,551
__

571
00:35:05,967 --> 00:35:08,033
(Door closes heavily)

572
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,666
MAN 1:
Concentrating around the north side,

573
00:35:13,667 --> 00:35:16,899
and then moving slowly south, here.

574
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,766
(Men talk quietly)

575
00:35:20,767 --> 00:35:22,700
MAN 1:
That's right.

576
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:25,533
- YOUNG DOCTOR: Sir Malcolm.
- SIR MALCOLM: Doctor.

577
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,499
YOUNG DOCTOR:
So you're the explorer?

578
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,766
I've made one or two
modest discoveries.

579
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,600
There's a Murray mountain
in the eastern regions

580
00:35:34,603 --> 00:35:37,966
of the Belgian Congo,
if you're ever in the vicinity.

581
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,967
Not the tallest mountain,
to be sure,

582
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:41,799
but not the smallest either.

583
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,466
Hmm.

584
00:35:43,467 --> 00:35:45,832
I've spent most of my life
in Africa,

585
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,833
beholding wonders.

586
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,966
I was surprised to get your note.

587
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,800
You seem a man
who holds his secrets fast.

588
00:35:53,803 --> 00:35:55,732
I wasn't going to come.

589
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:58,033
But you couldn't resist.

590
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,666
When you see a river,
you must follow it to its source,

591
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,650
no matter the perils,
no matter those comrades

592
00:36:07,651 --> 00:36:09,466
that fall along the way.

593
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,917
You must know how things work.

594
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:14,366
You must unlock.

595
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,066
You are dissatisfied always.

596
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,799
Are you dissatisfied?

597
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,234
SIR MALCOLM:
I'm seeking.

598
00:36:19,235 --> 00:36:20,666
YOUNG DOCTOR:
What?

599
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,066
Perhaps the same as you.

600
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:23,932
Mm, I seek the truth.

601
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,432
Ah, you're a very young man.

602
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:28,766
I've long since learned
that truth is mutable.

603
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:30,600
Perhaps we view science differently.

604
00:36:30,603 --> 00:36:32,433
- Do we?
- I would never chart a river

605
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:36,067
or scale a peak to take its measure
or plant a flag. There's no point.

606
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,432
It's solipsistic self-aggrandizement.

607
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:41,566
So too those scientists
who study the planets

608
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:44,099
seeking astronomical
enlightenment for its own sake.

609
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,132
The botanist studying the variegation
of an Amazonian fern.

610
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,167
The zoologist caught up
in the endless fascination

611
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:51,832
of an adder's coils.

612
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:55,466
And for what?

613
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:58,034
Knowledge for itself alone?

614
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:00,599
The elation of discovery?

615
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,999
Plant your flag on the truth?

616
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,734
There is only one worthy goal

617
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:09,466
for scientific exploration...

618
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:14,466
(whispers) piercing the tissue that
separates life from death.

619
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,933
Everything else,
from the deep bottom of the sea

620
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:21,034
to the top of the highest mountain
on the farthest planet,

621
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:22,999
is insignificant.

622
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,499
Life and death, Sir Malcolm.

623
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,032
The flicker that separates
one from the other,

624
00:37:29,033 --> 00:37:32,267
fast as a bat's wing,

625
00:37:32,268 --> 00:37:35,499
more beautiful than any sonnet.

626
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,700
That is my river.

627
00:37:37,701 --> 00:37:39,900
That is my mountain.

628
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:45,666
There I will plant my flag.

629
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:48,200
You have the soul of a poet, sir.

630
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:52,000
And the bank account to match.

631
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,566
Now why did you want to see me,
Sir Malcolm?

632
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:58,234
SIR MALCOLM:
You tell me.

633
00:37:58,235 --> 00:37:59,899
Last night, of course.

634
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,432
The body you bought was not,
strictly speaking, human.

635
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:04,466
No.

636
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:06,033
- Did you kill him?
- Yes.

637
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,231
- Are there more?
- At least one.

638
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:09,575
And what is your goal?

639
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,699
To find a cure
for a most rare disease.

640
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,866
Hence, I'm in a position
to offer you employment.

641
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:16,399
You seem to be a freethinker
who might imagine a world

642
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,466
less constrained by what
we think we know of as "truth."

643
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:21,632
You mean the supernatural?

644
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:26,600
I mean that place where science
and superstition walk hand-in-hand.

645
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:32,766
An anatomist of your skill
would be invaluable to my work.

646
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,633
You'll be well paid.

647
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,866
I have no interest in joining
an amateur occultist society.

648
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,767
SIR MALCOLM:
Nor I in forming one!

649
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,767
It is not a game for me.

650
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:51,632
Then stop playing as if it were.

651
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,033
What are you after?

652
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,467
I'm trying to rescue my daughter.

653
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,500
To save her,
I would murder the world.

654
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,532
Join me, doctor.

655
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:12,466
With me, you will behold
terrible wonders.

656
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:16,899
And how much of the world
will we have to murder?

657
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,733
Do you care?

658
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,684
I've only one other question:

659
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:25,466
(whispers) why me?

660
00:39:25,467 --> 00:39:28,952
Because you were unafraid
to pull back the skin

661
00:39:28,953 --> 00:39:31,433
and look beneath.

662
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:36,867
(Dog barks in the distance)

663
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,767

(Exhales forcefully,

689
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:01,566

691
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,066
(Breathing heavily)

(Ice cubes clink)

697
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:35,032
- You've no doubt?
- It was her.

698
00:42:35,033 --> 00:42:37,066
Was it an appeal?

699
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:38,784
I don't know.

700
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:40,499
At first...

701
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,799
there was such a need in her eyes

702
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,278
and then something...

703
00:42:46,204 --> 00:42:48,580
monstrous.

704
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,937
My true friend would do you no harm.

705
00:42:52,038 --> 00:42:54,261
Our nature doesn't change,
only our circumstance.

706
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:56,728
You don't know.

707
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,666
Don't I?

708
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:02,717
Was I not responsible?

709
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:06,367
But for my transgression,
would any of this have occurred?

710
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,966
We cannot unmake the past.

711
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:12,433
We shall live with our guilt,
you and I.

712
00:43:14,433 --> 00:43:18,767
After all this time, she came to me.

713
00:43:20,767 --> 00:43:23,433
I will find her.

714
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,866
There was another thought when
she was so very close to me,

715
00:43:31,867 --> 00:43:34,867
a strange working of memory.

716
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:40,232
I thought of a particular
lion hunt many years ago.

717
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:43,499
You're moving through the tall grass,
getting a glimpse of the prey,

718
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,066
the shoulders mostly, the mane.

719
00:43:46,067 --> 00:43:48,150
You prepare your rifle.

720
00:43:48,151 --> 00:43:50,232
You're very quiet.

721
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,099
And then there's a moment.

722
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,366
The wind changes,
the grass stops swaying.

723
00:43:59,367 --> 00:44:01,993
The lion turns,

724
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:06,329
looks at you.

725
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,532
The moment you realize
you are no longer the hunter,

726
00:44:11,533 --> 00:44:14,933
you are the prey.

727
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:22,967
(Rain pours down, footsteps splash)

728
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:28,866

00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:33,100

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,967

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,833

00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:53,100

00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:58,267

734
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,133
(Keys jingle, lock clicks,
door creaks open)

735
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,100
VANESSA:

736

Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,
sed libera nos a malo. Amen.

743
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:43,622
Pater noster, qui es caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.

744
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:45,660
Adveniat regnum tuum.

Fiat voluntas tua,
sicut in caelo et in terra.
