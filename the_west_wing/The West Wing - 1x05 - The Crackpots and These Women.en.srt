1
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:08,441
<i>Previously, on</i> The West Wing:

2
00:00:08,643 --> 00:00:12,556
You never want people to see
how you make laws or sausages.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,755
- I'm voting no.
- It's all we could get now.

4
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:17,197
You didn't work hard enough.

5
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:20,236
You have to let me protect you
and the president.

6
00:00:20,443 --> 00:00:23,958
The president doesn't hold grudges.
He pays me to.

7
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:26,723
There's no one in the world
I don't hate.

8
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:29,232
Your mom was killed
with a .38 revolver.

9
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:33,356
We haven't had success yet
having those weapons banned.

10
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:35,474
- You want to help us?
- Yes, sir.

11
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:42,952
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:45,756
Oh, yeah!

13
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:49,196
- That's how you do it.
- Game point.

14
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:51,359
- You look winded.
- I'm fine.

15
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:54,282
- You want to sit out?
- Why would I do that?

16
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:56,758
People will be mad if we kill you.

17
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,519
- Game point, let's go.
- Sir--

18
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:02,362
- I'm playing.
- There's no shame in quitting.

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,600
Just admit I'm a better athlete
and slink away.

20
00:01:06,403 --> 00:01:08,314
- Take it out.
- You're playing?

21
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:12,118
- Take the ball out!
- This is a perfect metaphor.

22
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:16,841
After you're gone, and poets
write "The Legend of Josiah Bartlet" ...

23
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,432
...let them make you a tragic figure.

24
00:01:19,643 --> 00:01:22,715
"He had the tools for greatness...

25
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:28,196
...but his better angels were silenced
by his obsessive need to win."

26
00:01:28,403 --> 00:01:31,281
- You wanna play or write my eulogy?
- Honestly?

27
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:33,280
Mr. Grant?

28
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,552
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:41,755
- Who's this?
- I'm making a substitution.

30
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:44,921
- Grant's a new member of my team.
- A ringer.

31
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:47,273
Mr. Grant is a federal employee.

32
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:51,033
It's not that you cheat,
it's how bad you are at it.

33
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:53,843
- I beg your pardon.
- Toby's got a point.

34
00:01:54,043 --> 00:01:55,032
When did I cheat?

35
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:59,759
You told us your tennis partner
worked at the American Consulate.

36
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:02,079
- She did!
- It was Steffi Graf!

37
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:04,751
I admit that she bore a resemblance--

38
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:09,514
You think I won't recognize
Steffi Graf when she's serving at me?

39
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:13,079
She's won championships,
we've seen her photograph.

40
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:17,322
Be that as it may,
Toby, Josh, Charlie...

41
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:20,198
...let me introduce
Mr. Rodney Grant...

42
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:23,759
...from the President's Council
on Physical Fitness.

43
00:02:23,963 --> 00:02:25,635
Game point, let's go!

44
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,879
Whoa, not so fast.

45
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:30,119
Your name sounds familiar.

46
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:34,152
Before you joined up the
Council on Physical Fitness...

47
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:38,197
...which the president would do well
to avail himself of...

48
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:41,761
...is it possible you played
organized ball?

49
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:44,041
I used to play a little.

50
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:46,234
- And where was that?
- I'm sorry?

51
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:49,037
- Where would that be?
- Duke.

52
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:54,802
- This guy was in the Final Four!
- Game point, let's go!

53
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:56,914
I'm taking you to the hole.

54
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:00,241
You got it!

55
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:04,842
Let the poets write about
that, Byron.

56
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:09,043
Charlie, guard the new guy.

57
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:01,112
- We have a staff meeting.
- I'm going.

58
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,998
- I'm just telling you.
- You see that's where I'm going.

59
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,957
- Isn't it adorable?
- That you seek to control me? Love it.

60
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:10,915
- Donald hasn't called.
- Who?

61
00:04:11,123 --> 00:04:13,318
Donald.
From the thing.

62
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:16,071
Can we be clear about my interest...

63
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:19,241
...in the local Gomers that you see...

64
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:22,560
...in the free time you create
by not working?

65
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,799
- Excuse me?
- You work very hard.

66
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,914
- And I am?
- Not controlling.

67
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,875
- You have a meeting.
- Okay.

68
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:31,039
- There's another thing.
- What?

69
00:04:31,243 --> 00:04:33,473
Hang on, here it is.

70
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:37,881
Leo wants you to meet Lacey
from the NSC in his office.

71
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,562
- Thanks.
- What is it?

72
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:43,517
This is the White House,
so it's probably not important.

73
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,078
I want you to read this article.

74
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:48,592
- What's it about?
- Smallpox.

75
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:53,319
- The disease?
- No, the dessert. Yes, the disease!

76
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:56,037
- We do it every month.
- We missed a few.

77
00:04:56,243 --> 00:04:58,803
We try to do it
the first of every month.

78
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,641
Twice in 12 months.

79
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:03,073
- We're behind.
- Behind on what?

80
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:06,719
It's People Who Want
to Discuss Things...

81
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:09,835
...That We Could Care
Less About Day.

82
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,476
That sounds goofy.

83
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:15,471
It's not so bad. Talk to them,
give them a souvenir pen....

84
00:05:16,043 --> 00:05:21,515
- This isn't a waste of time?
- Yes, but it's one of Leo's policies.

85
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:25,113
- Why?
- Sadly, you're about to find out.

86
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:30,078
Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer,
had a big block of cheese.

87
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:34,192
I am making a mental list
of those who are snickering.

88
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:38,874
Even as I speak,
I'm preparing appropriate retribution.

89
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,075
The block of cheese was huge,
over 2 tons.

90
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:45,161
It was there
for anyone who might be hungry.

91
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:50,278
Let's spend our time plotting against
a country that can't defend itself.

92
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,158
Later. Right now I'm talking
about President Jackson.

93
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:57,912
- You're talking about cheese.
- Sam goes on my list.

94
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:01,115
- What about Toby?
- I'm unpredictable.

95
00:06:01,603 --> 00:06:04,515
The White House
belongs to the people...

96
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:07,840
...so Jackson invited those
who wished an audience.

97
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:10,841
Then he made them eat
2 tons of cheese.

98
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:14,194
- In that spirit--
- Mandy doesn't go on the list?

99
00:06:14,803 --> 00:06:17,840
- Mandy's new.
- So it's just me on the list?

100
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:24,155
It is in the spirit of Andrew Jackson
that I ask senior staff...

101
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:29,995
...to meet with people who have
a hard time getting our attention.

102
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:35,118
I know the more jaded among you
see this as beneath you.

103
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:41,720
But listening to the voices of passion
in Americans is beneath no one.

104
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:44,477
Surely not the people's servants.

105
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,243
- Is it Total Crackpot Day again?
- Yes.

106
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,798
Note that Josh isn't on the list.

107
00:06:50,003 --> 00:06:52,278
- You have a thing right now.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:55,395
Hand out those appointments.

109
00:06:55,603 --> 00:07:00,802
- What's up?
- That's for "Total Crackpot Day."

110
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:04,483
Second of all,
this is Jonathan Lacey.

111
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:08,320
Good to meet you.
Mr. McGarry, would you mind?

112
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:13,712
- I know you're busy.
- What can I do for you?

113
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,153
Keep this card at all times.

114
00:07:16,363 --> 00:07:21,118
- If you lose it, you call us.
- Who's "us"?

115
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:24,315
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
I'm with the NSC.

116
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,832
I meant, what's the card do?

117
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:30,081
It says where to go
during a nuclear attack.

118
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:33,196
You're kidding me.

119
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,314
We want you
on Air Force One...

120
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:39,038
...or in an underground bunker
as quickly as possible.

121
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:42,239
Sure. Well....

122
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:47,680
Okay, I don't know what to say.

123
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,441
I guess that's it, then.

124
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:54,000
- If you have questions, call me.
- Sure.

125
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,677
My staff goes with me,
or do they--

126
00:08:01,563 --> 00:08:04,873
Oh, sorry.
You know what, I just got it.

127
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,562
Okay.

128
00:08:07,203 --> 00:08:11,958
I'll stick this right next
to my video club membership...

129
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:16,600
...and there's no reason
my staff ever has to know about it.

130
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:19,556
The best thing to do is
to forget about it.

131
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,834
I'll go now.

132
00:08:36,323 --> 00:08:38,962
The rise in the
Producer's Price Index...

133
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:41,518
...coupled with
the tight labor market...

134
00:08:41,723 --> 00:08:45,033
...have caused inflation concerns.
Are you worried?

135
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:47,882
No, Helen.
Our economy is fundamentally--

136
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,959
I wasn't Helen there.
I was Sandy King.

137
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:56,155
<i>- The Miami Herald</i>?
- She moved to the <i>Sun-Times.</i>

138
00:08:56,363 --> 00:08:59,912
- That sounded like your Helen.
- Are you concerned?

139
00:09:00,283 --> 00:09:03,878
Not at all. Our economy
remains fundamentally strong...

140
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:08,679
...shown by the drop in unemployment.
It's a cause for satisfaction.

141
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:12,512
A solitary spike in the PPI
is not cause for overreaction.

142
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:16,272
Also, there's been no increase
in wholesale prices.

143
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:19,600
If you could see clear
to not answer the question...

144
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:23,716
...like a professor with a stick up
his butt, that'd be good.

145
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:28,075
I am a professor with a
stick up my butt, but I'll do my best.

146
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:30,559
- That's it for the economy.
- Guns.

147
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:33,920
- We don't need to.
- They'll ask about guns.

148
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,796
I know they'll ask,
I'm saying I'm set.

149
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:40,040
- A question or two.
- Is it time for my scolding?

150
00:09:40,243 --> 00:09:42,711
- Are we having this argument?
- Sir?

151
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:45,073
Let's do guns, Sam.

152
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:48,912
Is there any reason to believe
this weapons ban bill...

153
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,240
- ...will have any reduction in crime?
- Yes. Next.

154
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:56,400
Mr. Zeigler, you have a follow-up?

155
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,959
We're lucky to get the question
and you blow it off?

156
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:03,600
- Yes.
- With due respect, may I ask why?

157
00:10:04,243 --> 00:10:07,280
- I'm weak-willed and stupid.
- Let's do this later.

158
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,680
- We talked.
- I talked it over with other people.

159
00:10:10,883 --> 00:10:14,193
- Which people?
- I have lots of other people.

160
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:16,917
We are missing a huge opportunity.

161
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:22,275
What's going on?

162
00:10:25,643 --> 00:10:28,715
- We're doing the thing.
- Why aren't you in there?

163
00:10:28,923 --> 00:10:33,599
- I was just going in.
- How are Toby and the president?

164
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:39,116
- They are having a disagreement.
- A disagreement or a fight?

165
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:43,077
- It certainly has the potential--
- For God's sake, Toby!

166
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,114
There we go.

167
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,682
Let's go in.

168
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:51,601
Josh, let's go in.

169
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:54,795
- Sir?
- I won't say the bill is worthless.

170
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:57,836
If we can just admit
its weaknesses, why not?

171
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:03,322
It'll anger the left, energize the
right and the middle will feel played.

172
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,673
Sorry, did you want to answer?

173
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,522
I'd have said, "Because I said so."

174
00:11:08,723 --> 00:11:11,476
Why take a victory
and declare defeat?

175
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:14,197
Toby, by changing some words--

176
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:17,315
- The world moves on a few words.
- Your point?

177
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:20,162
I have many.
I choose not to make them now.

178
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:24,834
On behalf of everybody here,
let me say that that's a relief.

179
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,034
- Excuse me, Leo.
- Yes?

180
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,199
My cheese appointment is here...

181
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:32,520
- ...but the conference takes priority.
- I agree.

182
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:34,918
No!

183
00:11:35,123 --> 00:11:36,795
You won't get out of it.

184
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:40,359
- This is an important conference.
- It's unimportant.

185
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:45,079
- It's about our future.
- It's about not having one lately.

186
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,438
Sam, go.

187
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,918
- Mr. President?
- We're going too.

188
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:52,957
- Sir?
- We'll pick this up this afternoon.

189
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:56,677
You're from
United States Space Command.

190
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,078
- Few know about us.
- My first time.

191
00:11:59,283 --> 00:12:03,117
- We're a little nerdy, I'll admit.
- You camouflage it well.

192
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,083
- I'm used to that.
- What can I do?

193
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:08,319
- In a nutshell?
- So to speak.

194
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:12,038
We'd like you to pay
more attention to UFOs.

195
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:16,595
- Are we paying any attention at all?
- No.

196
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:20,512
We have enough trouble
with the first lady's Ouija board.

197
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:23,237
I'd like to show the president data...

198
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,401
...on possible
extraterrestrial contact.

199
00:12:26,603 --> 00:12:28,719
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

200
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:33,481
He'll either yell or laugh at me.
Either way is bad for me.

201
00:12:34,163 --> 00:12:37,394
This morning, at 6:35 a.m...

202
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:41,994
...air traffic control in Honolulu
picked up a UFO...

203
00:12:42,203 --> 00:12:45,718
...flying east across the Pacific,
towards California.

204
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:48,312
Navy jets have been in the area...

205
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:51,833
...and have been unable
to establish visual contact.

206
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:53,874
These things go unexplained.

207
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,597
Shouldn't you take this
to the president?

208
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:59,761
- No.
- Again, may I ask why not?

209
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:03,353
There are levels in
our Air Defense Command.

210
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:07,681
To jump from a radar officer to the
president skips levels.

211
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:11,592
- Like what?
- Like the Pentagon and therapy.

212
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:14,840
- Okay, I can see that--
- No hard feelings...

213
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,238
...but I can't ask the president...

214
00:13:17,443 --> 00:13:20,879
...to put down the budget surplus
because of UFOs.

215
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,234
Something's heading east
over the Pacific.

216
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:27,594
It's in and out of our radar,
we can't see it.

217
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:30,875
It's up there right now.
I leave you with that.

218
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:34,837
I hope that you don't feel
that you've wasted your time.

219
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:36,522
Here's a pen.

220
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:40,238
The president isn't wild about
Posner's fundraiser...

221
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,753
...but I think we can't pass.
Where are you on this?

222
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:47,842
Don't worry about me,
you have to worry about Toby.

223
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:51,831
- That's why I'm shoring up support.
- I'm in.

224
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:55,558
They sent pictures
of the Malibu place.

225
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:58,960
- The one from the primary?
- No, he bought another.

226
00:13:59,163 --> 00:14:02,280
Where did Robert Benigni
push me into the pool?

227
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:05,441
That was Larry Posner's old place.

228
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:10,200
- If it gets a vote, isn't it worth it?
- If Benigni could vote here.

229
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:14,601
Since he's Italian, I'm just a wet
girl in a Donna Karan dress.

230
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,363
I'm the only one
who isn't an economist.

231
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:20,202
But it seems to me
the annual budget...

232
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:24,157
...is found either in balance,
in deficit, or in surplus.

233
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,834
I don't know how to tell Congress,
much less 8th grade graduates...

234
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:31,113
...that there's any in-between.

235
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:34,520
He's not talking about anything
being off-budget.

236
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:38,113
- Especially long-term capital outlays.
- You lost me.

237
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:41,235
In 1991, the budget had a
deficit of $22 billion.

238
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:45,197
But the national debt rose
from 5.2 trillion to 5.4 trillion...

239
00:14:45,403 --> 00:14:46,916
...in the same year.

240
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:53,596
That's a debt increase of $188 billion
against a $22 billion deficit.

241
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,202
This is good news.

242
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:59,078
- You knew those numbers?
- He's freakish.

243
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:02,277
- Zoey's coming for dinner.
- She's in town?

244
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:05,998
My daughter's starting Georgetown
after the first.

245
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:08,637
We're done.
My staff is waiting...

246
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:12,279
...and they haven't bothered me
for a few hours.

247
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:15,919
I'm gonna make chili.
I'll make it for everybody.

248
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:19,601
My friends, my daughter,
my beer and some chili!

249
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:22,522
You're gonna be the one to cook?

250
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:28,280
My daughter, Zoey, is down
from Hanover. I'm making chili.

251
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:32,317
- The first lady--
- She's in Pakistan. I eat what I want.

252
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:34,400
- I need ingredients.
- What?

253
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,753
- Chili.
- Don't listen to him.

254
00:15:37,363 --> 00:15:40,912
Mrs. Landingham wrote it down.
Give it to the steward.

255
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,956
And send everyone in.
Thank you, Charlie.

256
00:15:44,163 --> 00:15:46,882
How could you remember
that 10 years ago...

257
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:52,032
...there was a $188 billion debt
increase off a $22 billion deficit?

258
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,838
- God, I was right?
- That's what I thought.

259
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,118
Everyone, come in.

260
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,359
Listen up, everybody.

261
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:05,033
Zoey's down from Hanover,
I'm making chili tonight.

262
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:09,638
- Okay.
- Great. Chili.

263
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,720
Let's do this:

264
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:16,474
Look down at the big seal
in the middle of my carpet.

265
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:20,356
Now, everybody
look back up at me.

266
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,714
Zoey's down from Hanover,
and I'm making chili.

267
00:16:23,923 --> 00:16:25,515
- That's great!
- Terrific!

268
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,600
See how benevolent I can be...

269
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:32,035
...when everybody does what I say?
Now, sit down.

270
00:16:32,403 --> 00:16:35,679
I want this meeting
to last three minutes.

271
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:38,761
I will allow it to last
no more than five.

272
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:41,473
We're going to California soon.

273
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:43,833
Larry Posner wants a fundraiser.

274
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,556
- No.
- Why?

275
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:49,642
The day before,
the president is giving a speech...

276
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:52,994
- ...on violence in film.
- One he shouldn't give.

277
00:16:53,203 --> 00:16:55,159
- That's beside the point.
- So?

278
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,594
- Posner's movies are violent.
- So is <i>The Godfather.</i>

279
00:16:58,803 --> 00:17:03,001
What you mean to say is
Posner's movies are bad.

280
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:05,763
I mean to say,
his movies are indicative...

281
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:09,512
...of a Hollywood that is
excessively, arrogantly violent...

282
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:13,841
...and is promoting violence
and the disrespect of human life.

283
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:18,356
We can't admonish them Tuesday
and cash their check Wednesday.

284
00:17:18,563 --> 00:17:21,714
It's Hollywood.
Who gives a damn?

285
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,517
Hang on a second,
Mr. President.

286
00:17:24,723 --> 00:17:28,193
I'm drafting a speech
for the entertainment industry...

287
00:17:28,403 --> 00:17:33,272
...where we come out and say that
much of their product is corruptive.

288
00:17:33,483 --> 00:17:39,240
Are we doing this because we want them
to take moral leadership seriously...

289
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:43,356
...or because nobody has lost
an election attacking Hollywood?

290
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,236
Why can't we do both?

291
00:17:46,443 --> 00:17:49,594
- It's not hypocritical?
- No, because Sam is right.

292
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:54,354
It's not that Larry Posner's movies
have sex and violence.

293
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:56,281
They suck.
They're terrible.

294
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,953
But people see them
because they have sex and violence.

295
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:04,953
If people stop seeing crappy movies,
Posner would stop making them.

296
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:07,961
Is that strategy working
in the war on drugs?

297
00:18:08,163 --> 00:18:10,961
We are imploring these people...

298
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:14,200
...to step up
and not be quite so casual...

299
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,871
...with the awesome influence
they have.

300
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:21,281
But whenever someone blows thunder
at this ridiculous target...

301
00:18:21,483 --> 00:18:25,158
...it only distracts from the pursuit
of actual solutions!

302
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:27,001
Let me say one thing.

303
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:31,082
If I were an actor or a writer
or a director...

304
00:18:31,283 --> 00:18:34,593
...and someone came at me
with lists of things...

305
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:39,513
...that were American and un-American,
it would sound eerily familiar.

306
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:42,715
Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you?

307
00:18:42,923 --> 00:18:47,951
Nobody ever looks like Joe McCarthy.
That's how they get in the door.

308
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:51,200
We seem to have
wandered off the point a bit.

309
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:54,634
- Yeah, and time's up.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,835
- Chili tonight!
- Yes, sir.

311
00:18:59,363 --> 00:19:02,435
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

312
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,362
- You look a little....
- No, no.

313
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,836
- Know that donut on your desk?
- You ate it?

314
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:10,920
That was predictable, wasn't it?

315
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:15,196
- Any word yet on the....
- The thing's still out there.

316
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:19,312
I had a guy who wants us
to spend more time on UFOs.

317
00:19:19,523 --> 00:19:22,037
- We spend time on UFOs?
- I said that.

318
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:26,122
After the Ouija board....
I'm closing the door.

319
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:28,837
CPC picked this thing up on radar.

320
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,637
- Sam.
- Right.

321
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:35,880
Listen, you're close
with Cathy, right?

322
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:40,874
- I haven't seen her naked.
- That's not what I'm asking.

323
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:45,839
She's like my younger sister,
but she's paid and she frightens me.

324
00:19:46,043 --> 00:19:48,557
But I love her.
It's like you and Donna.

325
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,594
Right.

326
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:55,516
When they gave you the card
and said it's you and not Cathy...

327
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:58,641
...how did you feel about that?

328
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:02,313
- Gave me what card?
- The NSC card with directions.

329
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:04,878
The directions to...?

330
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:08,632
You, C.J., Toby.

331
00:20:08,843 --> 00:20:11,835
When the NSC guy gave you your cards.

332
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:17,957
Josh, what card?

333
00:20:21,403 --> 00:20:23,598
Nothing.

334
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,318
I was thinking of a different....

335
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:29,957
Nothing.

336
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,518
We'd like to tell you about Pluie.

337
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:36,998
- Who's Pluie?
- I'm glad you asked.

338
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,955
- That's Pluie?
- Yes.

339
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:41,040
- Pluie's a wolf?
- She is.

340
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,041
And you're gonna
tell me her story?

341
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,632
For 4 years, scientists
tracked Pluie...

342
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,357
...as she made her way from Alberta...

343
00:20:49,563 --> 00:20:51,235
...up and down the Rockies.

344
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:54,879
She's made 3 round trips
between Canada and Wyoming.

345
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,721
40,000 square miles.

346
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,756
It was an impressive performance...

347
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:04,354
...considering the impediments
of modern life she had to conquer.

348
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:08,351
Highways, housing,
forests denuded of trees.

349
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:13,000
- And the U.S.-Canadian border.
- Sure, no photo ID.

350
00:21:13,803 --> 00:21:15,521
I'm sorry?

351
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:18,120
That was a joke.

352
00:21:18,723 --> 00:21:20,361
Why does Pluie do it?

353
00:21:20,803 --> 00:21:25,923
Wolves have to breed with many packs
to keep from becoming extinct.

354
00:21:26,123 --> 00:21:30,878
If they breed among themselves,
they'll become genetically weaker...

355
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,353
...endangering long-term survival.

356
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:36,077
That helps explain Buckingham Palace.

357
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:39,877
- May we tell you what we propose?
- Sure.

358
00:21:41,243 --> 00:21:44,315
The wolves-only roadway.

359
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,841
The wolves-only roadway?

360
00:21:47,043 --> 00:21:50,922
1800 miles, from Yellowstone
to the Yukon territory...

361
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:53,398
...with highway overpasses.

362
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,676
- An 1800-mile wolves-only roadway?
- Pluie had to--

363
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,761
How do you teach wolves
to follow road signs?

364
00:22:00,963 --> 00:22:03,318
Our scientists
are working on a plan.

365
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:08,551
Pluie's gonna get drunk,
wander off the road and eat my cat.

366
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:14,157
- We don't think that'll happen.
- I don't think this'll happen.

367
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:18,197
Ranchers don't want wolves
returned to the West.

368
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,633
- Ranchers are killers.
- They aren't.

369
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,481
You should take that back.

370
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:27,154
Ranchers face falling stock prices,
rising taxes, drought...

371
00:22:27,363 --> 00:22:29,593
...and people eating less beef.

372
00:22:29,803 --> 00:22:32,522
They want to blame something.

373
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:35,237
I'd rather it be a wolf than us.

374
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:40,198
Pluie was shot and killed
by a rancher last month.

375
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:48,472
I'm sorry to hear that.

376
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,516
I'm not sure you are.

377
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:54,518
How much would it cost?

378
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:58,682
That's the beauty part.
With corporate sponsorship...

379
00:22:58,883 --> 00:23:04,162
...the cost to the taxpayer
is only $900 million.

380
00:23:09,563 --> 00:23:11,793
Seriously, how much would it cost?

381
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,836
If we're gonna do this,
why not do it right?

382
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,476
We're not gonna do it.

383
00:23:16,683 --> 00:23:19,117
Sure, there are
other ways to spend.

384
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:20,472
You think?

385
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,117
What's a better way
to spend the money?

386
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,234
$900 million?

387
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:27,718
Another war plane or S & L bailout?

388
00:23:27,923 --> 00:23:30,391
How about the nine best schools?

389
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:33,561
Let's move on
to the grizzly bear.

390
00:23:39,563 --> 00:23:40,757
Can I talk to you?

391
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:44,518
Did you get him a spot
on Hollywood Squares?

392
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,476
You know Posner's a huge supporter.

393
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,275
I know.

394
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:52,122
- I came to be nice to you.
- Go ahead.

395
00:23:52,643 --> 00:23:56,602
- I don't like going against you.
- I don't either.

396
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:01,957
That's you being nice?

397
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:06,835
I'm glad Rosen
passed on the communications job.

398
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:09,682
They couldn't have
done better than you.

399
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,042
Excuse me?

400
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:16,316
You're a better director
than David Rosen would've been.

401
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,835
That's me being nice.

402
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:22,638
- I asked if I was the first choice...
- Back to this?

403
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,515
...you called me paranoid.

404
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,918
You called me a paranoid nudnik.

405
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:30,877
For the last time, you weren't the
president's second choice.

406
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,835
- And David Rosen?
- What?

407
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,681
Mandy was in my office.

408
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:37,556
She said she's happy
Rosen passed on my job.

409
00:24:37,763 --> 00:24:40,960
We'll start in a few minutes.
Give fair warning.

410
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,912
I don't know anything.
Where is this coming from?

411
00:24:45,123 --> 00:24:48,672
Help me with the gun thing.
Hollywood can wait.

412
00:24:48,883 --> 00:24:50,760
Since when do you need help?

413
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,602
Since I became the kid
raising his hand...

414
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:56,795
...that nobody wants
the teacher to call on.

415
00:24:57,123 --> 00:24:59,512
Just help me, please.

416
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:02,881
I appreciate you
squeezing me in like this.

417
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,721
I was able to cancel someone.

418
00:25:04,923 --> 00:25:07,517
You shouldn't have,
it's not a big deal.

419
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,998
What's not a big deal?

420
00:25:10,603 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm out of practice.

421
00:25:12,683 --> 00:25:15,243
That comes from
not seeing me for months.

422
00:25:15,443 --> 00:25:19,231
The idea would make the people
I work for nervous.

423
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:22,077
Why are you here now?

424
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:24,319
This is gonna sound silly.

425
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:33,481
There's a magazine article--
A magazine article came out...

426
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:39,280
...and it said several countries
have stored the smallpox virus.

427
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:43,921
- Are you afraid you have smallpox?
- No.

428
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,278
Don't laugh.

429
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:53,881
- I have <i>Ave Maria</i> stuck in my head.
- The Schubert?

430
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:58,076
Yeah, I've been humming it
to myself all morning.

431
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:04,761
- Why do you think the <i>Ave Maria</i>?
- Why do you think?

432
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,193
I don't know.

433
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,762
My sister played it over and over,
I don't know how many years ago.

434
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:16,158
- Your sister who died?
- Joanie.

435
00:26:17,003 --> 00:26:20,040
Why did Joanie play
the <i>Ave Maria</i> in her room?

436
00:26:20,243 --> 00:26:23,758
She liked music.
A lot.

437
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:26,394
She wanted to be a conductor.

438
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:30,721
She used to pretend she was
conducting to the music.

439
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,394
Anyway, that, and I was
a little thrown off this morning...

440
00:26:35,603 --> 00:26:37,833
...when they gave me this card.

441
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,603
I was the only one who got one.

442
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:44,591
I mean, of my friends.
That surprised me.

443
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,600
- Joanie, Toby and C.J.
- Joanie?

444
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:49,876
- What?
- You named Joanie in there.

445
00:26:50,683 --> 00:26:53,561
You said you got a card
and Joanie didn't.

446
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:56,118
I meant.... No.

447
00:26:57,843 --> 00:27:01,119
We were just talking about Joanie.

448
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:02,996
What kind of card?

449
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,478
It was....

450
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:08,397
There are things I can't discuss.

451
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:14,235
I'm not withholding anything
I should be emotionally available for.

452
00:27:15,443 --> 00:27:17,798
- Okay.
- Thanks.

453
00:27:19,003 --> 00:27:21,995
Can you talk about it,
but not talk about it?

454
00:27:22,203 --> 00:27:23,955
I gotta go.

455
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:28,361
- Sorry you canceled an appointment.
- But I did cancel.

456
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:33,079
- Take off your coat.
- It was impulsive, I wasted your time.

457
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:37,401
Do you think it's strange
you haven't told me how Joanie died?

458
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:40,037
- I've told you.
- No, you haven't.

459
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:43,121
- Sure, I have.
- No.

460
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,638
It's not a big deal.

461
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:58,522
She was babysitting for me
and there was a fire.

462
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,513
How'd the fire start?

463
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:08,121
I honestly don't remember.

464
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:12,555
Something about a popcorn maker.

465
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:15,721
And the house caught on fire?

466
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:20,674
- Yeah.
- While Joanie was babysitting you?

467
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,513
Why aren't you dead?

468
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:35,117
I ran out of the house.

469
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:42,714
You were just a little boy.
That's what you were supposed to do.

470
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,557
I was knocking,
but you didn't answer.

471
00:29:17,763 --> 00:29:21,153
- I didn't hear the door.
- What are you doing?

472
00:29:21,363 --> 00:29:25,151
I'm ready to brief the president
on the smallpox article.

473
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:29,197
Forget about that for tonight
and come have some chili.

474
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:32,918
An NSC staffer gave me a card
with instructions...

475
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,921
...for what to do
in a nuclear attack.

476
00:29:36,123 --> 00:29:42,119
They want me up in a plane or down
in a bunker. They don't want you.

477
00:29:42,803 --> 00:29:47,160
Or Sam or Toby, for that matter.

478
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:52,915
I didn't want to be friends with you
and have you not know.

479
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,193
Have you been upset about this?

480
00:29:57,643 --> 00:29:59,156
Yes.

481
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:02,918
You're sweet sometimes,
you really are.

482
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:06,593
Of course they don't want me,
I'm a press secretary.

483
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:09,112
They won't be issuing any releases.

484
00:30:09,323 --> 00:30:13,794
Sam and Toby are communications.
And speeches won't be a priority.

485
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:16,801
Come. Have some fun.

486
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:21,158
This is a beautiful piece of music.
Do you know this?

487
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:23,513
I'm Catholic.

488
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:25,919
Hang on, listen....

489
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:31,963
That, right there.

490
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:39,032
It's miraculous.

491
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:46,319
- Schubert was crazy, you know?
- Yes.

492
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:52,157
Do you have to be crazy
to create something powerful?

493
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,240
The Cold War is over. There's--

494
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:58,561
God, C.J.,
it's not gonna be like that.

495
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:03,317
It's not gonna be the red phone
and nuclear bombs.

496
00:31:03,523 --> 00:31:06,321
- What's it gonna be?
- It's gonna be this.

497
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:11,881
Smallpox has been gone for 50 years.
No one has an acquired immunity.

498
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:16,281
It flies through the air.
You carry a 10-foot cloud around you.

499
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:21,034
If 100 people in New York City got it,
you'd have to encircle them...

500
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:24,952
...with 100 million vaccinated people
to contain it.

501
00:31:25,203 --> 00:31:28,832
Do you know how many doses
of the vaccine exist here?

502
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,233
Seven.

503
00:31:31,443 --> 00:31:34,674
100 people get it,
we'll have a global emergency...

504
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:38,512
...that'll make HIV
look like cold and flu season.

505
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:44,836
It's gonna be a test tube with a
rubber cap that's deteriorating.

506
00:31:45,043 --> 00:31:48,240
A guy steps out of
Times Square station--

507
00:31:48,443 --> 00:31:51,321
Smashes it on the sidewalk.

508
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:54,083
There's a world war right there.

509
00:32:01,763 --> 00:32:04,482
We'll make more vaccine.

510
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:09,438
You better hurry.
I'm the only one with a card.

511
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:14,601
- The president is asking for you.
- In a minute.

512
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:17,920
You really are very sweet sometimes.

513
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:29,434
It's all about the fundamentals.
Keep your feet moving on defense.

514
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:32,595
Pass and get open on offense.

515
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:35,522
I am a master of the fundamentals.

516
00:32:35,723 --> 00:32:39,159
That is why my team
thoroughly dominated yours.

517
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:42,799
Didn't hurt having
an ACC Player of the Week.

518
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,439
- Kids don't understand.
- No appreciation for the game.

519
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:47,962
- Are you drunk?
- No.

520
00:32:48,163 --> 00:32:50,597
- Now, why--
- I just like asking.

521
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:53,556
- I tell you--
- Give it up. Where's Zoey?

522
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,242
She's in the kitchen.

523
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:57,832
Wolves don't kill people.
It's a myth.

524
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,954
Now she's become a wolf person?

525
00:33:00,163 --> 00:33:05,521
More people are killed getting change
out of vending machines.

526
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:08,795
People killed last year
by vending machines: four.

527
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:11,756
Number of people killed
by wolf attack: zero.

528
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:13,880
Excuse me.

529
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:16,199
People die from vending machines?

530
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:20,112
- Hey, good to see you.
- Mr. President.

531
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:31,672
I guess we haven't been
getting along too well, lately.

532
00:33:32,283 --> 00:33:33,921
No, I guess not.

533
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:38,275
- I've been irritating you?
- Yes.

534
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:43,192
Was David Rosen
your first choice for my job?

535
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,753
Yes.

536
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:53,235
I'm glad we had this little talk.

537
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,877
I feel a lot better, thanks.

538
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:58,881
We were up all night
on that one, Toby.

539
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:01,438
Me and Leo and Josh.

540
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:05,795
They were screaming at me,
"Governor, it's gotta be Toby."

541
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:09,316
I held my ground
and we went to Rosen.

542
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:14,597
And he wanted to take a partnership
at Salomon Brothers, thank God.

543
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,399
I couldn't live without you.

544
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:22,074
I mean it, I'd be in the tall grass.
In the weeds.

545
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:27,634
I know I disappoint you sometimes.
I can sense it.

546
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:31,313
I only get mad because
you're right a lot of times.

547
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,440
You aren't the kid in class
with his hand up.

548
00:34:36,643 --> 00:34:39,476
Whatever it was you said to C.J.

549
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:43,801
You are a wise
and brilliant man, Toby.

550
00:34:48,323 --> 00:34:53,522
The other night, on the court,
did you mean what you said?

551
00:34:53,723 --> 00:34:58,239
That my demons were shouting down
my better angels?

552
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:00,832
Yes, sir, I did.

553
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:07,881
You think that's
what's stopping me from greatness?

554
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:10,199
Yes.

555
00:35:12,203 --> 00:35:15,036
I suppose you're right.

556
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:18,314
I'll tell you what, though.

557
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:23,995
In a battle between a president's
demons and his better angels...

558
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:27,320
...for the first time in
a long while...

559
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:31,562
...I think we might just
have ourselves a fair fight.

560
00:35:32,603 --> 00:35:34,992
Thank you, Toby.

561
00:35:35,683 --> 00:35:37,514
Now, go away.

562
00:35:48,843 --> 00:35:51,721
- Drop the spoon.
- I knew it was you.

563
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,756
- You look good!
- You look like death!

564
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:56,919
Thanks. I have a new barber.

565
00:35:57,123 --> 00:36:01,560
- I heard you've been nutty today.
- Mind your own business.

566
00:36:01,763 --> 00:36:05,233
- What classes you taking?
- Mind your own business.

567
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:13,483
- Charlie, you met Zoey Bartlet?
- It's a pleasure, ma'am.

568
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:16,273
Let's take it back a moment.

569
00:36:16,483 --> 00:36:19,600
This is a girl.
You don't call her "ma'am."

570
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,363
- Beg your pardon. Did I call you--
- Zoey.

571
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:26,636
- I should call you Zoey?
- If I can call you Charlie.

572
00:36:26,843 --> 00:36:29,152
- The president--
- That's her father.

573
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:32,275
You're forbidden from adding
cumin to the chili.

574
00:36:32,483 --> 00:36:34,553
Check to see if he's nearby.

575
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,598
I have certain instructions.

576
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:41,842
- You're fine.
- Taste this.

577
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:45,956
- Doesn't it need cumin?
- It needs oregano.

578
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,676
Well, let's get to work.

579
00:36:47,883 --> 00:36:49,953
See you guys.

580
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:54,602
Maybe the vending machines
fall on them...

581
00:36:54,803 --> 00:36:57,795
...while they're
getting their change.

582
00:36:58,003 --> 00:37:02,519
We can build schools
and protect wildlife at the same time.

583
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:06,722
- Pluie really got to you?
- He really was very sweet.

584
00:37:06,923 --> 00:37:08,993
Josh, we were looking for you.

585
00:37:10,243 --> 00:37:12,632
- Look at this.
- Look at what, sir?

586
00:37:13,603 --> 00:37:16,117
Nothing makes me feel quite so good...

587
00:37:16,323 --> 00:37:19,599
...as colleagues enjoying each other
outside work.

588
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:23,120
What were you guys
talking about?

589
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,632
We were talking about these women.

590
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,437
We can't get over these women.

591
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:34,077
C.J.'s like a '50s movie star.
So capable, loving and energetic.

592
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:38,595
Look at Mandy over there.
Going punch for punch with Toby...

593
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:42,159
...in a world that tells women
to sit down and shut up.

594
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:45,321
She's already won her battle
with the president.

595
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:48,560
But she's not done.
She wants Toby.

596
00:37:48,763 --> 00:37:51,118
Mrs. Landingham.

597
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:54,315
Did you guys know
she lost two sons in Vietnam?

598
00:37:54,523 --> 00:38:00,314
Why she serves her country is beyond
me, but she's not missed a day's work.

599
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:05,836
There's Cathy,
Donna, and Margaret....

600
00:38:06,043 --> 00:38:09,274
There's something that's
been bothering me.

601
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:13,271
- I know it's an inappropriate time.
- What's on your mind?

602
00:38:13,483 --> 00:38:19,433
I serve the president,
and it's an unforgettable privilege.

603
00:38:19,643 --> 00:38:21,873
I can't keep this.

604
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:25,120
It's a white flag of surrender.

605
00:38:25,323 --> 00:38:28,360
I wanna be a comfort
to my friends in tragedy...

606
00:38:28,563 --> 00:38:30,872
...and celebrate with them in triumph.

607
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:36,682
For the times in between, I wanna
be able to look them in the eye.

608
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:40,842
I wanna be with my friends,
my family...

609
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:43,477
...and these women.

610
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:53,118
Excuse me.

611
00:38:54,403 --> 00:38:57,600
Thank you.
Friends, please.

612
00:38:57,843 --> 00:39:00,118
The chili's ready,
I hope you enjoy it.

613
00:39:00,323 --> 00:39:03,042
Since I told you
you would enjoy it...

614
00:39:03,243 --> 00:39:05,996
...I'm reasonably certain
that you will.

615
00:39:07,683 --> 00:39:09,878
The first lady is in Pakistan.

616
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,961
I'm not entirely sure why,
but I've learned...

617
00:39:13,163 --> 00:39:16,633
...it's a good idea not to
ask too many questions.

618
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:19,994
It seldom leads to anything
but confusion.

619
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:24,754
I miss her very much, but I'm delighted
our daughter is here.

620
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:28,632
You know, she's starting Georgetown
in the spring.

621
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:34,597
This, prior to medical school
and a life of celibacy.

622
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,998
Yeah, right.

623
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:39,398
It's an incredible adventure.

624
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:43,642
Four years full of people and
experiences you haven't dreamed of.

625
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,641
Allow me just one minute of business.

626
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:49,755
I hope by the time
our four years are done...

627
00:39:49,963 --> 00:39:52,602
...we see to it
that anyone who chooses...

628
00:39:52,803 --> 00:39:57,081
...can go to college,
regardless of their economic status.

629
00:39:57,283 --> 00:39:58,921
Here, here.

630
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:05,282
I hear that today was another one of
Leo's "big block of cheese" days.

631
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:10,841
You all start out cynical, but there's
always one or two converts a day.

632
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:14,592
Today was no exception.
C.J. is gonna be up all night...

633
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:19,797
....writing a position paper on the
necessity of wildlife protection.

634
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:24,155
C.J., I don't mind the cost
of this wolves-only highway.

635
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:25,842
It's the segregation.

636
00:40:26,043 --> 00:40:29,353
The ACLU will file a petition
on behalf of reindeer...

637
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,360
...and we're all screwed.

638
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:34,555
Sam Seaborn had a guy
who spotted a UFO today.

639
00:40:34,763 --> 00:40:38,199
He's been thinking about it
ever since.

640
00:40:38,403 --> 00:40:43,033
It wasn't a ship from another planet,
just another time.

641
00:40:43,243 --> 00:40:45,234
An abandoned Soviet satellite.

642
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:49,755
Its booster didn't fire
and it couldn't escape Earth's orbit.

643
00:40:49,963 --> 00:40:54,832
A reminder of a time when two powerful
nations challenged each other...

644
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:58,638
...and then boldly raced
into outer space.

645
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,993
What will be the next challenge...

646
00:41:01,843 --> 00:41:05,040
...that makes us go farther
and work harder?

647
00:41:05,243 --> 00:41:07,916
When smallpox was eradicated...

648
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:12,913
...it was the greatest humanitarian
achievement of this century.

649
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:15,273
Surely we can do it again...

650
00:41:15,483 --> 00:41:19,112
...as when our eyes
looked towards the heavens...

651
00:41:19,323 --> 00:41:23,362
...and with outstretched fingers,
we touched the face of God.

652
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:27,116
Here's to absent friends...

653
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:30,281
...and the ones that are here now.

654
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:10,438

<i>Previously, on</i> The West Wing:

656
00:42:19,332 --> 00:42:23,245
You never want people to see
how you make laws or sausages.

657
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:26,444
- I'm voting no.
- It's all we could get now.

658
00:42:26,692 --> 00:42:27,886
You didn't work hard enough.

659
00:42:28,092 --> 00:42:30,925
You have to let me protect you
and the president.

660
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:34,647
The president doesn't hold grudges.
He pays me to.

661
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,412
There's no one in the world
I don't hate.

662
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,921
Your mom was killed
with a .38 revolver.

663
00:42:40,132 --> 00:42:44,045
We haven't had success yet
having those weapons banned.

664
00:42:44,252 --> 00:42:46,163
- You want to help us?
- Yes, sir.

665
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:53,641
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

666
00:42:54,932 --> 00:42:56,445
Oh, yeah!

667
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:59,885
- That's how you do it.
- Game point.

668
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:02,048
- You look winded.
- I'm fine.

669
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:04,971
- You want to sit out?
- Why would I do that?

670
00:43:05,172 --> 00:43:07,447
People will be mad if we kill you.

671
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,208
- Game point, let's go.
- Sir--

672
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:13,051
- I'm playing.
- There's no shame in quitting.

673
00:43:13,252 --> 00:43:16,289
Just admit I'm a better athlete
and slink away.

674
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:19,003
- Take it out.
- You're playing?

675
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:22,807
- Take the ball out!
- This is a perfect metaphor.

676
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:27,530
After you're gone, and poets
write "The Legend of Josiah Bartlet"...

677
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:30,121
...let them make you a tragic figure.

678
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:33,404
"He had the tools for greatness...

679
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:38,885
...but his better angels were silenced
by his obsessive need to win."

680
00:43:39,092 --> 00:43:41,970
- You wanna play or write my eulogy?
- Honestly?

681
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:43,969
Mr. Grant?

682
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,241
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

683
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:52,444
- Who's this?
- I'm making a substitution.

684
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:55,610
- Grant's a new member of my team.
- A ringer.

685
00:43:55,812 --> 00:43:57,962
Mr. Grant is a federal employee.

686
00:43:58,412 --> 00:44:01,722
It's not that you cheat,
it's how bad you are at it.

687
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,532
- I beg your pardon.
- Toby's got a point.

688
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:05,721
When did I cheat?

689
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:10,448
You told us your tennis partner
worked at the American Consulate.

690
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:12,768
- She did!
- It was Steffi Graf!

691
00:44:12,972 --> 00:44:15,440
I admit that she bore a resemblance--

692
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:20,203
You think I won't recognize
Steffi Graf when she's serving at me?

693
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:23,768
She's won championships,
we've seen her photograph.

694
00:44:23,972 --> 00:44:28,011
Be that as it may,
Toby, Josh, Charlie...

695
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:30,887
...let me introduce
Mr. Rodney Grant...

696
00:44:31,092 --> 00:44:34,448
...from the President's Council
on Physical Fitness.

697
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,324
Game point, let's go!

698
00:44:36,532 --> 00:44:38,568
Whoa, not so fast.

699
00:44:38,772 --> 00:44:40,808
Your name sounds familiar.

700
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,841
Before you joined up the
Council on Physical Fitness...

701
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:48,886
...which the president would do well
to avail himself of...

702
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:52,450
...is it possible you played
organized ball?

703
00:44:53,092 --> 00:44:54,730
I used to play a little.

704
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:56,923
- And where was that?
- I'm sorry?

705
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:59,726
- Where would that be?
- Duke.

706
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,491
- This guy was in the Final Four!
- Game point, let's go!

707
00:45:05,692 --> 00:45:07,603
I'm taking you to the hole.

708
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:10,930
You got it!

709
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:15,531
Let the poets write about
that, Byron.

710
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,732
Charlie, guard the new guy.

711
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:11,801
- We have a staff meeting.
- I'm going.

712
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:15,687
- I'm just telling you.
- You see that's where I'm going.

713
00:46:15,892 --> 00:46:19,646
- Isn't it adorable?
- That you seek to control me? Love it.

714
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:21,604
- Donald hasn't called.
- Who?

715
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,007
Donald.
From the thing.

716
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:26,760
Can we be clear about my interest...

717
00:46:26,972 --> 00:46:29,930
...in the local Gomers that you see...

718
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:33,249
...in the free time you create
by not working?

719
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:35,488
- Excuse me?
- You work very hard.

720
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,603
- And I am?
- Not controlling.

721
00:46:37,812 --> 00:46:39,564
- You have a meeting.
- Okay.

722
00:46:39,772 --> 00:46:41,728
- There's another thing.
- What?

723
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,162
Hang on, here it is.

724
00:46:44,372 --> 00:46:48,570
Leo wants you to meet Lacey
from the NSC in his office.

725
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,251
- Thanks.
- What is it?

726
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:54,206
This is the White House,
so it's probably not important.

727
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,767
I want you to read this article.

728
00:46:56,972 --> 00:46:59,281
- What's it about?
- Smallpox.

729
00:46:59,492 --> 00:47:04,008
- The disease?
- No, the dessert. Yes, the disease!

730
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:06,726
- We do it every month.
- We missed a few.

731
00:47:06,932 --> 00:47:09,492
We try to do it
the first of every month.

732
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:11,330
Twice in 12 months.

733
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:13,762
- We're behind.
- Behind on what?

734
00:47:13,972 --> 00:47:17,408
It's People Who Want
to Discuss Things...

735
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:20,524
...That We Could Care
Less About Day.

736
00:47:20,732 --> 00:47:22,165
That sounds goofy.

737
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:26,160
It's not so bad. Talk to them,
give them a souvenir pen....

738
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:32,204
- This isn't a waste of time?
- Yes, but it's one of Leo's policies.

739
00:47:32,412 --> 00:47:35,802
- Why?
- Sadly, you're about to find out.

740
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:40,767
Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer,
had a big block of cheese.

741
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:44,881
I am making a mental list
of those who are snickering.

742
00:47:45,092 --> 00:47:49,563
Even as I speak,
I'm preparing appropriate retribution.

743
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:52,764
The block of cheese was huge,
over 2 tons.

744
00:47:52,972 --> 00:47:55,850
It was there
for anyone who might be hungry.

745
00:47:56,052 --> 00:48:00,967
Let's spend our time plotting against
a country that can't defend itself.

746
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:04,847
Later. Right now I'm talking
about President Jackson.

747
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:08,601
- You're talking about cheese.
- Sam goes on my list.

748
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:11,804
- What about Toby?
- I'm unpredictable.

749
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:15,204
The White House
belongs to the people...

750
00:48:15,412 --> 00:48:18,529
...so Jackson invited those
who wished an audience.

751
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:21,530
Then he made them eat
2 tons of cheese.

752
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,883
- In that spirit--
- Mandy doesn't go on the list?

753
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:28,529
- Mandy's new.
- So it's just me on the list?

754
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:34,844
It is in the spirit of Andrew Jackson
that I ask senior staff...

755
00:48:35,052 --> 00:48:40,684
...to meet with people who have
a hard time getting our attention.

756
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:45,807
I know the more jaded among you
see this as beneath you.

757
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:52,409
But listening to the voices of passion
in Americans is beneath no one.

758
00:48:52,652 --> 00:48:55,166
Surely not the people's servants.

759
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:57,932
- Is it Total Crackpot Day again?
- Yes.

760
00:48:58,132 --> 00:49:00,487
Note that Josh isn't on the list.

761
00:49:00,692 --> 00:49:02,967
- You have a thing right now.
- Yeah.

762
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:06,084
Hand out those appointments.

763
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:11,491
- What's up?
- That's for "Total Crackpot Day."

764
00:49:12,612 --> 00:49:15,172
Second of all,
this is Jonathan Lacey.

765
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:19,009
Good to meet you.
Mr. McGarry, would you mind?

766
00:49:20,772 --> 00:49:24,401
- I know you're busy.
- What can I do for you?

767
00:49:24,612 --> 00:49:26,842
Keep this card at all times.

768
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:31,807
- If you lose it, you call us.
- Who's "us"?

769
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:35,004
I'm sorry, I thought you knew.
I'm with the NSC.

770
00:49:35,212 --> 00:49:37,521
I meant, what's the card do?

771
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:40,770
It says where to go
during a nuclear attack.

772
00:49:42,372 --> 00:49:43,885
You're kidding me.

773
00:49:44,092 --> 00:49:46,003
We want you
on Air Force One...

774
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:49,727
...or in an underground bunker
as quickly as possible.

775
00:49:50,812 --> 00:49:52,928
Sure. Well....

776
00:49:55,252 --> 00:49:58,369
Okay, I don't know what to say.

777
00:49:58,572 --> 00:50:00,130
I guess that's it, then.

778
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:04,689
- If you have questions, call me.
- Sure.

779
00:50:05,772 --> 00:50:08,366
My staff goes with me,
or do they--

780
00:50:12,252 --> 00:50:15,562
Oh, sorry.
You know what, I just got it.

781
00:50:15,772 --> 00:50:17,251
Okay.

782
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:22,647
I'll stick this right next
to my video club membership...

783
00:50:22,852 --> 00:50:27,289
...and there's no reason
my staff ever has to know about it.

784
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:30,245
The best thing to do is
to forget about it.

785
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,523
I'll go now.

786
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:49,651
The rise in the
Producer's Price Index...

787
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:52,207
...coupled with
the tight labor market...

788
00:50:52,412 --> 00:50:55,722
...have caused inflation concerns.
Are you worried?

789
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:58,571
No, Helen.
Our economy is fundamentally--

790
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:03,648
I wasn't Helen there.
I was Sandy King.

791
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:06,844
<i>- The Miami Herald</i>?
- She moved to the <i>Sun-Times.</i>

792
00:51:07,052 --> 00:51:10,601
- That sounded like your Helen.
- Are you concerned?

793
00:51:10,972 --> 00:51:14,567
Not at all. Our economy
remains fundamentally strong...

794
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:19,368
...shown by the drop in unemployment.
It's a cause for satisfaction.

795
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:23,201
A solitary spike in the PPI
is not cause for overreaction.

796
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:26,961
Also, there's been no increase
in wholesale prices.

797
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:30,289
If you could see clear
to not answer the question...

798
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:34,405
...like a professor with a stick up
his butt, that'd be good.

799
00:51:34,612 --> 00:51:38,764
I am a professor with a
stick up my butt, but I'll do my best.

800
00:51:39,212 --> 00:51:41,248
- That's it for the economy.
- Guns.

801
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:44,609
- We don't need to.
- They'll ask about guns.

802
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:47,485
I know they'll ask,
I'm saying I'm set.

803
00:51:47,692 --> 00:51:50,729
- A question or two.
- Is it time for my scolding?

804
00:51:50,932 --> 00:51:53,400
- Are we having this argument?
- Sir?

805
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:55,762
Let's do guns, Sam.

806
00:51:55,972 --> 00:51:59,601
Is there any reason to believe
this weapons ban bill...

807
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:02,929
- ...will have any reduction in crime?
- Yes. Next.

808
00:52:03,972 --> 00:52:07,089
Mr. Zeigler, you have a follow-up?

809
00:52:07,292 --> 00:52:10,648
We're lucky to get the question
and you blow it off?

810
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:14,289
- Yes.
- With due respect, may I ask why?

811
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,969
- I'm weak-willed and stupid.
- Let's do this later.

812
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:21,369
- We talked.
- I talked it over with other people.

813
00:52:21,572 --> 00:52:24,882
- Which people?
- I have lots of other people.

814
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:27,606
We are missing a huge opportunity.

815
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:32,964
What's going on?

816
00:52:36,332 --> 00:52:39,404
- We're doing the thing.
- Why aren't you in there?

817
00:52:39,612 --> 00:52:44,288
- I was just going in.
- How are Toby and the president?

818
00:52:44,492 --> 00:52:49,805
- They are having a disagreement.
- A disagreement or a fight?

819
00:52:50,012 --> 00:52:53,766
- It certainly has the potential--
- For God's sake, Toby!

820
00:52:53,972 --> 00:52:55,803
There we go.

821
00:52:56,892 --> 00:52:58,371
Let's go in.

822
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:02,290
Josh, let's go in.

823
00:53:02,492 --> 00:53:05,484
- Sir?
- I won't say the bill is worthless.

824
00:53:05,692 --> 00:53:08,525
If we can just admit
its weaknesses, why not?

825
00:53:08,732 --> 00:53:14,011
It'll anger the left, energize the
right and the middle will feel played.

826
00:53:14,212 --> 00:53:16,362
Sorry, did you want to answer?

827
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:19,211
I'd have said, "Because I said so."

828
00:53:19,412 --> 00:53:22,165
Why take a victory
and declare defeat?

829
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:24,886
Toby, by changing some words--

830
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:28,004
- The world moves on a few words.
- Your point?

831
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:30,851
I have many.
I choose not to make them now.

832
00:53:31,052 --> 00:53:35,523
On behalf of everybody here,
let me say that that's a relief.

833
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:37,723
- Excuse me, Leo.
- Yes?

834
00:53:37,932 --> 00:53:39,888
My cheese appointment is here...

835
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:43,209
- ...but the conference takes priority.
- I agree.

836
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:45,607
No!

837
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:47,484
You won't get out of it.

838
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:51,048
- This is an important conference.
- It's unimportant.

839
00:53:51,252 --> 00:53:55,768
- It's about our future.
- It's about not having one lately.

840
00:53:56,012 --> 00:53:57,127
Sam, go.

841
00:53:57,332 --> 00:53:59,607
- Mr. President?
- We're going too.

842
00:53:59,812 --> 00:54:03,646
- Sir?
- We'll pick this up this afternoon.

843
00:54:04,852 --> 00:54:07,366
You're from
United States Space Command.

844
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:09,767
- Few know about us.
- My first time.

845
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:13,806
- We're a little nerdy, I'll admit.
- You camouflage it well.

846
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:16,772
- I'm used to that.
- What can I do?

847
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:19,008
- In a nutshell?
- So to speak.

848
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:22,727
We'd like you to pay
more attention to UFOs.

849
00:54:24,212 --> 00:54:27,284
- Are we paying any attention at all?
- No.

850
00:54:27,492 --> 00:54:31,201
We have enough trouble
with the first lady's Ouija board.

851
00:54:31,412 --> 00:54:33,926
I'd like to show the president data...

852
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:37,090
...on possible
extraterrestrial contact.

853
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:39,408
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

854
00:54:39,892 --> 00:54:44,170
He'll either yell or laugh at me.
Either way is bad for me.

855
00:54:44,852 --> 00:54:48,083
This morning, at 6:35 a.m...

856
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:52,683
...air traffic control in Honolulu
picked up a UFO...

857
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:56,407
...flying east across the Pacific,
towards California.

858
00:54:56,612 --> 00:54:59,001
Navy jets have been in the area...

859
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:02,522
...and have been unable
to establish visual contact.

860
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,563
These things go unexplained.

861
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:07,286
Shouldn't you take this
to the president?

862
00:55:07,492 --> 00:55:10,450
- No.
- Again, may I ask why not?

863
00:55:10,652 --> 00:55:14,042
There are levels in
our Air Defense Command.

864
00:55:14,252 --> 00:55:18,370
To jump from a radar officer to the
president skips levels.

865
00:55:18,572 --> 00:55:22,281
- Like what?
- Like the Pentagon and therapy.

866
00:55:22,492 --> 00:55:25,529
- Okay, I can see that--
- No hard feelings...

867
00:55:25,732 --> 00:55:27,927
...but I can't ask the president...

868
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:31,568
...to put down the budget surplus
because of UFOs.

869
00:55:31,772 --> 00:55:34,923
Something's heading east
over the Pacific.

870
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:38,283
It's in and out of our radar,
we can't see it.

871
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:41,564
It's up there right now.
I leave you with that.

872
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,526
I hope that you don't feel
that you've wasted your time.

873
00:55:45,732 --> 00:55:47,211
Here's a pen.

874
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:50,927
The president isn't wild about
Posner's fundraiser...

875
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:54,442
...but I think we can't pass.
Where are you on this?

876
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:58,531
Don't worry about me,
you have to worry about Toby.

877
00:55:58,732 --> 00:56:02,520
- That's why I'm shoring up support.
- I'm in.

878
00:56:03,892 --> 00:56:06,247
They sent pictures
of the Malibu place.

879
00:56:06,452 --> 00:56:09,649
- The one from the primary?
- No, he bought another.

880
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:12,969
Where did Robert Benigni
push me into the pool?

881
00:56:13,172 --> 00:56:16,130
That was Larry Posner's old place.

882
00:56:16,532 --> 00:56:20,889
- If it gets a vote, isn't it worth it?
- If Benigni could vote here.

883
00:56:21,092 --> 00:56:25,290
Since he's Italian, I'm just a wet
girl in a Donna Karan dress.

884
00:56:25,492 --> 00:56:28,052
I'm the only one
who isn't an economist.

885
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,891
But it seems to me
the annual budget...

886
00:56:31,092 --> 00:56:34,846
...is found either in balance,
in deficit, or in surplus.

887
00:56:35,052 --> 00:56:39,523
I don't know how to tell Congress,
much less 8th grade graduates...

888
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:41,802
...that there's any in-between.

889
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:45,209
He's not talking about anything
being off-budget.

890
00:56:45,412 --> 00:56:48,802
- Especially long-term capital outlays.
- You lost me.

891
00:56:49,012 --> 00:56:51,924
In 1991, the budget had a
deficit of $22 billion.

892
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:55,886
But the national debt rose
from 5.2 trillion to 5.4 trillion...

893
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:57,605
...in the same year.

894
00:56:57,812 --> 00:57:04,285
That's a debt increase of $188 billion
against a $22 billion deficit.

895
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:05,891
This is good news.

896
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:09,767
- You knew those numbers?
- He's freakish.

897
00:57:10,372 --> 00:57:12,966
- Zoey's coming for dinner.
- She's in town?

898
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:16,687
My daughter's starting Georgetown
after the first.

899
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,326
We're done.
My staff is waiting...

900
00:57:19,532 --> 00:57:22,968
...and they haven't bothered me
for a few hours.

901
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:26,608
I'm gonna make chili.
I'll make it for everybody.

902
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:30,290
My friends, my daughter,
my beer and some chili!

903
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:33,211
You're gonna be the one to cook?

904
00:57:34,532 --> 00:57:38,969
My daughter, Zoey, is down
from Hanover. I'm making chili.

905
00:57:39,172 --> 00:57:43,006
- The first lady--
- She's in Pakistan. I eat what I want.

906
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:45,089
- I need ingredients.
- What?

907
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:47,442
- Chili.
- Don't listen to him.

908
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:51,601
Mrs. Landingham wrote it down.
Give it to the steward.

909
00:57:51,812 --> 00:57:54,645
And send everyone in.
Thank you, Charlie.

910
00:57:54,852 --> 00:57:57,571
How could you remember
that 10 years ago...

911
00:57:57,772 --> 00:58:02,721
...there was a $188 billion debt
increase off a $22 billion deficit?

912
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:06,527
- God, I was right?
- That's what I thought.

913
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:09,807
Everyone, come in.

914
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:12,048
Listen up, everybody.

915
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:15,722
Zoey's down from Hanover,
I'm making chili tonight.

916
00:58:16,652 --> 00:58:20,327
- Okay.
- Great. Chili.

917
00:58:20,612 --> 00:58:22,409
Let's do this:

918
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:27,163
Look down at the big seal
in the middle of my carpet.

919
00:58:28,212 --> 00:58:31,045
Now, everybody
look back up at me.

920
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:34,403
Zoey's down from Hanover,
and I'm making chili.

921
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:36,204
- That's great!
- Terrific!

922
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,289
See how benevolent I can be...

923
00:58:38,492 --> 00:58:42,724
...when everybody does what I say?
Now, sit down.

924
00:58:43,092 --> 00:58:46,368
I want this meeting
to last three minutes.

925
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:49,450
I will allow it to last
no more than five.

926
00:58:49,932 --> 00:58:52,162
We're going to California soon.

927
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:54,522
Larry Posner wants a fundraiser.

928
00:58:54,732 --> 00:58:56,245
- No.
- Why?

929
00:58:56,452 --> 00:59:00,331
The day before,
the president is giving a speech...

930
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:03,683
- ...on violence in film.
- One he shouldn't give.

931
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:05,848
- That's beside the point.
- So?

932
00:59:06,052 --> 00:59:09,283
- Posner's movies are violent.
- So is <i>The Godfather.</i>

933
00:59:09,492 --> 00:59:13,690
What you mean to say is
Posner's movies are bad.

934
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:16,452
I mean to say,
his movies are indicative...

935
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:20,201
...of a Hollywood that is
excessively, arrogantly violent...

936
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:24,530
...and is promoting violence
and the disrespect of human life.

937
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:29,045
We can't admonish them Tuesday
and cash their check Wednesday.

938
00:59:29,252 --> 00:59:32,403
It's Hollywood.
Who gives a damn?

939
00:59:32,612 --> 00:59:35,206
Hang on a second,
Mr. President.

940
00:59:35,412 --> 00:59:38,882
I'm drafting a speech
for the entertainment industry...

941
00:59:39,092 --> 00:59:43,961
...where we come out and say that
much of their product is corruptive.

942
00:59:44,172 --> 00:59:49,929
Are we doing this because we want them
to take moral leadership seriously...

943
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:54,045
...or because nobody has lost
an election attacking Hollywood?

944
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:56,925
Why can't we do both?

945
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:00,283
- It's not hypocritical?
- No, because Sam is right.

946
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:05,043
It's not that Larry Posner's movies
have sex and violence.

947
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:06,970
They suck.
They're terrible.

948
01:00:07,172 --> 01:00:10,642
But people see them
because they have sex and violence.

949
01:00:10,852 --> 01:00:15,642
If people stop seeing crappy movies,
Posner would stop making them.

950
01:00:15,852 --> 01:00:18,650
Is that strategy working
in the war on drugs?

951
01:00:18,852 --> 01:00:21,650
We are imploring these people...

952
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:24,889
...to step up
and not be quite so casual...

953
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:27,560
...with the awesome influence
they have.

954
01:00:27,772 --> 01:00:31,970
But whenever someone blows thunder
at this ridiculous target...

955
01:00:32,172 --> 01:00:35,847
...it only distracts from the pursuit
of actual solutions!

956
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:37,690
Let me say one thing.

957
01:00:37,892 --> 01:00:41,771
If I were an actor or a writer
or a director...

958
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,282
...and someone came at me
with lists of things...

959
01:00:45,492 --> 01:00:50,202
...that were American and un-American,
it would sound eerily familiar.

960
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:53,404
Do I look like Joe McCarthy to you?

961
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:58,640
Nobody ever looks like Joe McCarthy.
That's how they get in the door.

962
01:00:58,852 --> 01:01:01,889
We seem to have
wandered off the point a bit.

963
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:05,323
- Yeah, and time's up.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

964
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:08,524
- Chili tonight!
- Yes, sir.

965
01:01:10,052 --> 01:01:13,124
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

966
01:01:13,332 --> 01:01:16,051
- You look a little....
- No, no.

967
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:19,525
- Know that donut on your desk?
- You ate it?

968
01:01:19,732 --> 01:01:21,609
That was predictable, wasn't it?

969
01:01:21,812 --> 01:01:25,885
- Any word yet on the....
- The thing's still out there.

970
01:01:26,452 --> 01:01:30,001
I had a guy who wants us
to spend more time on UFOs.

971
01:01:30,212 --> 01:01:32,726
- We spend time on UFOs?
- I said that.

972
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:36,811
After the Ouija board....
I'm closing the door.

973
01:01:37,012 --> 01:01:39,526
CPC picked this thing up on radar.

974
01:01:39,732 --> 01:01:42,326
- Sam.
- Right.

975
01:01:43,452 --> 01:01:46,569
Listen, you're close
with Cathy, right?

976
01:01:47,172 --> 01:01:51,563
- I haven't seen her naked.
- That's not what I'm asking.

977
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:56,528
She's like my younger sister,
but she's paid and she frightens me.

978
01:01:56,732 --> 01:01:59,246
But I love her.
It's like you and Donna.

979
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,283
Right.

980
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:06,205
When they gave you the card
and said it's you and not Cathy...

981
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:09,330
...how did you feel about that?

982
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:13,002
- Gave me what card?
- The NSC card with directions.

983
01:02:13,212 --> 01:02:15,567
The directions to...?

984
01:02:15,772 --> 01:02:19,321
You, C.J., Toby.

985
01:02:19,532 --> 01:02:22,524
When the NSC guy gave you your cards.

986
01:02:26,212 --> 01:02:28,646
Josh, what card?

987
01:02:32,092 --> 01:02:34,287
Nothing.

988
01:02:35,812 --> 01:02:38,007
I was thinking of a different....

989
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,646
Nothing.

990
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:45,207
We'd like to tell you about Pluie.

991
01:02:45,412 --> 01:02:47,687
- Who's Pluie?
- I'm glad you asked.

992
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:49,644
- That's Pluie?
- Yes.

993
01:02:49,852 --> 01:02:51,729
- Pluie's a wolf?
- She is.

994
01:02:51,932 --> 01:02:54,730
And you're gonna
tell me her story?

995
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:57,321
For 4 years, scientists
tracked Pluie...

996
01:02:57,532 --> 01:03:00,046
...as she made her way from Alberta...

997
01:03:00,252 --> 01:03:01,924
...up and down the Rockies.

998
01:03:02,132 --> 01:03:05,568
She's made 3 round trips
between Canada and Wyoming.

999
01:03:05,772 --> 01:03:07,410
40,000 square miles.

1000
01:03:07,612 --> 01:03:10,445
It was an impressive performance...

1001
01:03:10,652 --> 01:03:15,043
...considering the impediments
of modern life she had to conquer.

1002
01:03:15,252 --> 01:03:19,040
Highways, housing,
forests denuded of trees.

1003
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:23,689
- And the U.S.-Canadian border.
- Sure, no photo ID.

1004
01:03:24,492 --> 01:03:26,210
I'm sorry?

1005
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:28,809
That was a joke.

1006
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:31,050
Why does Pluie do it?

1007
01:03:31,492 --> 01:03:36,612
Wolves have to breed with many packs
to keep from becoming extinct.

1008
01:03:36,812 --> 01:03:41,567
If they breed among themselves,
they'll become genetically weaker...

1009
01:03:41,812 --> 01:03:44,042
...endangering long-term survival.

1010
01:03:44,252 --> 01:03:46,766
That helps explain Buckingham Palace.

1011
01:03:47,972 --> 01:03:50,566
- May we tell you what we propose?
- Sure.

1012
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:55,004
The wolves-only roadway.

1013
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:57,530
The wolves-only roadway?

1014
01:03:57,732 --> 01:04:01,611
1800 miles, from Yellowstone
to the Yukon territory...

1015
01:04:01,812 --> 01:04:04,087
...with highway overpasses.

1016
01:04:04,292 --> 01:04:08,365
- An 1800-mile wolves-only roadway?
- Pluie had to--

1017
01:04:08,572 --> 01:04:11,450
How do you teach wolves
to follow road signs?

1018
01:04:11,652 --> 01:04:14,007
Our scientists
are working on a plan.

1019
01:04:14,212 --> 01:04:19,240
Pluie's gonna get drunk,
wander off the road and eat my cat.

1020
01:04:21,092 --> 01:04:24,846
- We don't think that'll happen.
- I don't think this'll happen.

1021
01:04:25,052 --> 01:04:28,886
Ranchers don't want wolves
returned to the West.

1022
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:31,322
- Ranchers are killers.
- They aren't.

1023
01:04:31,532 --> 01:04:33,170
You should take that back.

1024
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:37,843
Ranchers face falling stock prices,
rising taxes, drought...

1025
01:04:38,052 --> 01:04:40,282
...and people eating less beef.

1026
01:04:40,492 --> 01:04:43,211
They want to blame something.

1027
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,926
I'd rather it be a wolf than us.

1028
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:50,887
Pluie was shot and killed
by a rancher last month.

1029
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:59,161
I'm sorry to hear that.

1030
01:04:59,372 --> 01:05:02,205
I'm not sure you are.

1031
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,207
How much would it cost?

1032
01:05:05,412 --> 01:05:09,371
That's the beauty part.
With corporate sponsorship...

1033
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:14,851
...the cost to the taxpayer
is only $900 million.

1034
01:05:20,252 --> 01:05:22,482
Seriously, how much would it cost?

1035
01:05:22,692 --> 01:05:25,525
If we're gonna do this,
why not do it right?

1036
01:05:25,732 --> 01:05:27,165
We're not gonna do it.

1037
01:05:27,372 --> 01:05:29,806
Sure, there are
other ways to spend.

1038
01:05:30,012 --> 01:05:31,161
You think?

1039
01:05:31,372 --> 01:05:33,806
What's a better way
to spend the money?

1040
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:35,923
$900 million?

1041
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,407
Another war plane or S & L bailout?

1042
01:05:38,612 --> 01:05:41,080
How about the nine best schools?

1043
01:05:41,292 --> 01:05:44,250
Let's move on
to the grizzly bear.

1044
01:05:50,252 --> 01:05:51,446
Can I talk to you?

1045
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:55,207
Did you get him a spot
on Hollywood Squares?

1046
01:05:55,412 --> 01:05:58,165
You know Posner's a huge supporter.

1047
01:05:58,372 --> 01:05:59,964
I know.

1048
01:06:00,172 --> 01:06:02,811
- I came to be nice to you.
- Go ahead.

1049
01:06:03,332 --> 01:06:07,291
- I don't like going against you.
- I don't either.

1050
01:06:10,052 --> 01:06:12,646
That's you being nice?

1051
01:06:14,452 --> 01:06:17,524
I'm glad Rosen
passed on the communications job.

1052
01:06:17,732 --> 01:06:20,371
They couldn't have
done better than you.

1053
01:06:21,252 --> 01:06:22,731
Excuse me?

1054
01:06:22,932 --> 01:06:27,005
You're a better director
than David Rosen would've been.

1055
01:06:27,772 --> 01:06:29,524
That's me being nice.

1056
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:33,327
- I asked if I was the first choice...
- Back to this?

1057
01:06:33,532 --> 01:06:35,204
...you called me paranoid.

1058
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,607
You called me a paranoid nudnik.

1059
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:41,566
For the last time, you weren't the
president's second choice.

1060
01:06:41,772 --> 01:06:43,524
- And David Rosen?
- What?

1061
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:45,370
Mandy was in my office.

1062
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:48,245
She said she's happy
Rosen passed on my job.

1063
01:06:48,452 --> 01:06:51,649
We'll start in a few minutes.
Give fair warning.

1064
01:06:51,892 --> 01:06:55,601
I don't know anything.
Where is this coming from?

1065
01:06:55,812 --> 01:06:59,361
Help me with the gun thing.
Hollywood can wait.

1066
01:06:59,572 --> 01:07:01,449
Since when do you need help?

1067
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:04,291
Since I became the kid
raising his hand...

1068
01:07:04,492 --> 01:07:07,484
...that nobody wants
the teacher to call on.

1069
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:10,201
Just help me, please.

1070
01:07:10,692 --> 01:07:13,570
I appreciate you
squeezing me in like this.

1071
01:07:13,772 --> 01:07:15,410
I was able to cancel someone.

1072
01:07:15,612 --> 01:07:18,206
You shouldn't have,
it's not a big deal.

1073
01:07:18,412 --> 01:07:20,687
What's not a big deal?

1074
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:23,169
I'm out of practice.

1075
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:25,932
That comes from
not seeing me for months.

1076
01:07:26,132 --> 01:07:29,920
The idea would make the people
I work for nervous.

1077
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:32,766
Why are you here now?

1078
01:07:32,972 --> 01:07:35,008
This is gonna sound silly.

1079
01:07:38,812 --> 01:07:44,170
There's a magazine article--
A magazine article came out...

1080
01:07:44,372 --> 01:07:49,969
...and it said several countries
have stored the smallpox virus.

1081
01:07:50,492 --> 01:07:54,610
- Are you afraid you have smallpox?
- No.

1082
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,967
Don't laugh.

1083
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:04,570
- I have <i>Ave Maria</i> stuck in my head.
- The Schubert?

1084
01:08:04,772 --> 01:08:08,765
Yeah, I've been humming it
to myself all morning.

1085
01:08:11,332 --> 01:08:15,450
- Why do you think the <i>Ave Maria</i>?
- Why do you think?

1086
01:08:15,652 --> 01:08:17,882
I don't know.

1087
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:24,451
My sister played it over and over,
I don't know how many years ago.

1088
01:08:24,652 --> 01:08:26,847
- Your sister who died?
- Joanie.

1089
01:08:27,692 --> 01:08:30,729
Why did Joanie play
the <i>Ave Maria</i> in her room?

1090
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:34,447
She liked music.
A lot.

1091
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:37,083
She wanted to be a conductor.

1092
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:41,410
She used to pretend she was
conducting to the music.

1093
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:46,083
Anyway, that, and I was
a little thrown off this morning...

1094
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:48,522
...when they gave me this card.

1095
01:08:48,732 --> 01:08:51,292
I was the only one who got one.

1096
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:55,280
I mean, of my friends.
That surprised me.

1097
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:57,289
- Joanie, Toby and C.J.
- Joanie?

1098
01:08:57,732 --> 01:09:00,565
- What?
- You named Joanie in there.

1099
01:09:01,372 --> 01:09:04,250
You said you got a card
and Joanie didn't.

1100
01:09:04,452 --> 01:09:06,807
I meant.... No.

1101
01:09:08,532 --> 01:09:11,808
We were just talking about Joanie.

1102
01:09:12,172 --> 01:09:13,685
What kind of card?

1103
01:09:13,892 --> 01:09:16,167
It was....

1104
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,086
There are things I can't discuss.

1105
01:09:19,292 --> 01:09:24,924
I'm not withholding anything
I should be emotionally available for.

1106
01:09:26,132 --> 01:09:28,487
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1107
01:09:29,692 --> 01:09:32,684
Can you talk about it,
but not talk about it?

1108
01:09:32,892 --> 01:09:34,644
I gotta go.

1109
01:09:34,852 --> 01:09:39,050
- Sorry you canceled an appointment.
- But I did cancel.

1110
01:09:39,252 --> 01:09:43,768
- Take off your coat.
- It was impulsive, I wasted your time.

1111
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:48,090
Do you think it's strange
you haven't told me how Joanie died?

1112
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,726
- I've told you.
- No, you haven't.

1113
01:09:50,932 --> 01:09:53,810
- Sure, I have.
- No.

1114
01:09:55,052 --> 01:09:57,327
It's not a big deal.

1115
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:09,211
She was babysitting for me
and there was a fire.

1116
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:12,202
How'd the fire start?

1117
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:18,810
I honestly don't remember.

1118
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:23,244
Something about a popcorn maker.

1119
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:26,410
And the house caught on fire?

1120
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:31,363
- Yeah.
- While Joanie was babysitting you?

1121
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:38,202
Why aren't you dead?

1122
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,806
I ran out of the house.

1123
01:10:47,692 --> 01:10:53,403
You were just a little boy.
That's what you were supposed to do.

1124
01:11:25,812 --> 01:11:28,246
I was knocking,
but you didn't answer.

1125
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:31,842
- I didn't hear the door.
- What are you doing?

1126
01:11:32,052 --> 01:11:35,840
I'm ready to brief the president
on the smallpox article.

1127
01:11:36,052 --> 01:11:39,886
Forget about that for tonight
and come have some chili.

1128
01:11:40,092 --> 01:11:43,607
An NSC staffer gave me a card
with instructions...

1129
01:11:43,812 --> 01:11:46,610
...for what to do
in a nuclear attack.

1130
01:11:46,812 --> 01:11:52,808
They want me up in a plane or down
in a bunker. They don't want you.

1131
01:11:53,492 --> 01:11:57,849
Or Sam or Toby, for that matter.

1132
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:03,604
I didn't want to be friends with you
and have you not know.

1133
01:12:04,812 --> 01:12:06,882
Have you been upset about this?

1134
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:09,845
Yes.

1135
01:12:11,252 --> 01:12:13,607
You're sweet sometimes,
you really are.

1136
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:17,282
Of course they don't want me,
I'm a press secretary.

1137
01:12:17,492 --> 01:12:19,801
They won't be issuing any releases.

1138
01:12:20,012 --> 01:12:24,483
Sam and Toby are communications.
And speeches won't be a priority.

1139
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:27,490
Come. Have some fun.

1140
01:12:28,332 --> 01:12:31,847
This is a beautiful piece of music.
Do you know this?

1141
01:12:32,052 --> 01:12:34,202
I'm Catholic.

1142
01:12:34,652 --> 01:12:36,608
Hang on, listen....

1143
01:12:40,092 --> 01:12:42,652
That, right there.

1144
01:12:46,172 --> 01:12:49,721
It's miraculous.

1145
01:12:53,652 --> 01:12:57,008
- Schubert was crazy, you know?
- Yes.

1146
01:12:59,092 --> 01:13:02,846
Do you have to be crazy
to create something powerful?

1147
01:13:03,052 --> 01:13:04,929
The Cold War is over. There's--

1148
01:13:05,132 --> 01:13:09,250
God, C.J.,
it's not gonna be like that.

1149
01:13:10,172 --> 01:13:14,006
It's not gonna be the red phone
and nuclear bombs.

1150
01:13:14,212 --> 01:13:17,010
- What's it gonna be?
- It's gonna be this.

1151
01:13:17,212 --> 01:13:22,570
Smallpox has been gone for 50 years.
No one has an acquired immunity.

1152
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:26,970
It flies through the air.
You carry a 10-foot cloud around you.

1153
01:13:27,172 --> 01:13:31,723
If 100 people in New York City got it,
you'd have to encircle them...

1154
01:13:31,932 --> 01:13:35,641
...with 100 million vaccinated people
to contain it.

1155
01:13:35,892 --> 01:13:39,521
Do you know how many doses
of the vaccine exist here?

1156
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:41,922
Seven.

1157
01:13:42,132 --> 01:13:45,363
100 people get it,
we'll have a global emergency...

1158
01:13:45,572 --> 01:13:49,201
...that'll make HIV
look like cold and flu season.

1159
01:13:50,132 --> 01:13:55,525
It's gonna be a test tube with a
rubber cap that's deteriorating.

1160
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:58,929
A guy steps out of
Times Square station--

1161
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:02,010
Smashes it on the sidewalk.

1162
01:14:02,212 --> 01:14:04,772
There's a world war right there.

1163
01:14:12,452 --> 01:14:15,171
We'll make more vaccine.

1164
01:14:16,532 --> 01:14:20,127
You better hurry.
I'm the only one with a card.

1165
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:25,290
- The president is asking for you.
- In a minute.

1166
01:14:25,492 --> 01:14:28,609
You really are very sweet sometimes.

1167
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:40,123
It's all about the fundamentals.
Keep your feet moving on defense.

1168
01:14:40,372 --> 01:14:43,284
Pass and get open on offense.

1169
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:46,211
I am a master of the fundamentals.

1170
01:14:46,412 --> 01:14:49,848
That is why my team
thoroughly dominated yours.

1171
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,488
Didn't hurt having
an ACC Player of the Week.

1172
01:14:53,692 --> 01:14:57,128
- Kids don't understand.
- No appreciation for the game.

1173
01:14:57,332 --> 01:14:58,651
- Are you drunk?
- No.

1174
01:14:58,852 --> 01:15:01,286
- Now, why--
- I just like asking.

1175
01:15:01,492 --> 01:15:04,245
- I tell you--
- Give it up. Where's Zoey?

1176
01:15:04,452 --> 01:15:05,931
She's in the kitchen.

1177
01:15:06,132 --> 01:15:08,521
Wolves don't kill people.
It's a myth.

1178
01:15:08,732 --> 01:15:10,643
Now she's become a wolf person?

1179
01:15:10,852 --> 01:15:16,210
More people are killed getting change
out of vending machines.

1180
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:19,484
People killed last year
by vending machines: four.

1181
01:15:19,692 --> 01:15:22,445
Number of people killed
by wolf attack: zero.

1182
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:24,569
Excuse me.

1183
01:15:24,772 --> 01:15:26,888
People die from vending machines?

1184
01:15:27,092 --> 01:15:30,801
- Hey, good to see you.
- Mr. President.

1185
01:15:38,812 --> 01:15:42,361
I guess we haven't been
getting along too well, lately.

1186
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:44,610
No, I guess not.

1187
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:48,964
- I've been irritating you?
- Yes.

1188
01:15:50,252 --> 01:15:53,881
Was David Rosen
your first choice for my job?

1189
01:15:57,292 --> 01:15:59,442
Yes.

1190
01:16:00,932 --> 01:16:03,924
I'm glad we had this little talk.

1191
01:16:04,132 --> 01:16:06,566
I feel a lot better, thanks.

1192
01:16:06,772 --> 01:16:09,570
We were up all night
on that one, Toby.

1193
01:16:09,772 --> 01:16:12,127
Me and Leo and Josh.

1194
01:16:12,332 --> 01:16:16,484
They were screaming at me,
"Governor, it's gotta be Toby."

1195
01:16:17,332 --> 01:16:20,005
I held my ground
and we went to Rosen.

1196
01:16:20,212 --> 01:16:25,286
And he wanted to take a partnership
at Salomon Brothers, thank God.

1197
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:28,088
I couldn't live without you.

1198
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:32,763
I mean it, I'd be in the tall grass.
In the weeds.

1199
01:16:33,852 --> 01:16:38,323
I know I disappoint you sometimes.
I can sense it.

1200
01:16:38,532 --> 01:16:42,002
I only get mad because
you're right a lot of times.

1201
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:47,129
You aren't the kid in class
with his hand up.

1202
01:16:47,332 --> 01:16:50,165
Whatever it was you said to C.J.

1203
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:54,490
You are a wise
and brilliant man, Toby.

1204
01:16:59,012 --> 01:17:04,211
The other night, on the court,
did you mean what you said?

1205
01:17:04,412 --> 01:17:08,928
That my demons were shouting down
my better angels?

1206
01:17:09,132 --> 01:17:11,521
Yes, sir, I did.

1207
01:17:14,372 --> 01:17:18,570
You think that's
what's stopping me from greatness?

1208
01:17:18,772 --> 01:17:20,888
Yes.

1209
01:17:22,892 --> 01:17:25,725
I suppose you're right.

1210
01:17:27,012 --> 01:17:29,003
I'll tell you what, though.

1211
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:34,684
In a battle between a president's
demons and his better angels...

1212
01:17:34,892 --> 01:17:38,009
...for the first time in
a long while...

1213
01:17:38,212 --> 01:17:42,251
...I think we might just
have ourselves a fair fight.

1214
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:45,681
Thank you, Toby.

1215
01:17:46,372 --> 01:17:48,203
Now, go away.

1216
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:02,410
- Drop the spoon.
- I knew it was you.

1217
01:18:02,612 --> 01:18:05,445
- You look good!
- You look like death!

1218
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:07,608
Thanks. I have a new barber.

1219
01:18:07,812 --> 01:18:12,249
- I heard you've been nutty today.
- Mind your own business.

1220
01:18:12,452 --> 01:18:15,922
- What classes you taking?
- Mind your own business.

1221
01:18:19,052 --> 01:18:24,172
- Charlie, you met Zoey Bartlet?
- It's a pleasure, ma'am.

1222
01:18:24,812 --> 01:18:26,962
Let's take it back a moment.

1223
01:18:27,172 --> 01:18:30,289
This is a girl.
You don't call her "ma'am."

1224
01:18:30,492 --> 01:18:33,052
- Beg your pardon. Did I call you--
- Zoey.

1225
01:18:33,252 --> 01:18:37,325
- I should call you Zoey?
- If I can call you Charlie.

1226
01:18:37,532 --> 01:18:39,841
- The president--
- That's her father.

1227
01:18:40,052 --> 01:18:42,964
You're forbidden from adding
cumin to the chili.

1228
01:18:43,172 --> 01:18:45,242
Check to see if he's nearby.

1229
01:18:46,092 --> 01:18:48,287
I have certain instructions.

1230
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:52,531
- You're fine.
- Taste this.

1231
01:18:52,732 --> 01:18:56,645
- Doesn't it need cumin?
- It needs oregano.

1232
01:18:56,852 --> 01:18:58,365
Well, let's get to work.

1233
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:00,642
See you guys.

1234
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:05,291
Maybe the vending machines
fall on them...

1235
01:19:05,492 --> 01:19:08,484
...while they're
getting their change.

1236
01:19:08,692 --> 01:19:13,208
We can build schools
and protect wildlife at the same time.

1237
01:19:13,452 --> 01:19:17,411
- Pluie really got to you?
- He really was very sweet.

1238
01:19:17,612 --> 01:19:19,682
Josh, we were looking for you.

1239
01:19:20,932 --> 01:19:23,321
- Look at this.
- Look at what, sir?

1240
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:26,806
Nothing makes me feel quite so good...

1241
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,288
...as colleagues enjoying each other
outside work.

1242
01:19:30,612 --> 01:19:33,809
What were you guys
talking about?

1243
01:19:34,012 --> 01:19:36,321
We were talking about these women.

1244
01:19:36,532 --> 01:19:39,126
We can't get over these women.

1245
01:19:39,772 --> 01:19:44,766
C.J.'s like a '50s movie star.
So capable, loving and energetic.

1246
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:49,284
Look at Mandy over there.
Going punch for punch with Toby...

1247
01:19:49,492 --> 01:19:52,848
...in a world that tells women
to sit down and shut up.

1248
01:19:53,052 --> 01:19:56,010
She's already won her battle
with the president.

1249
01:19:56,212 --> 01:19:59,249
But she's not done.
She wants Toby.

1250
01:19:59,452 --> 01:20:01,807
Mrs. Landingham.

1251
01:20:02,012 --> 01:20:05,004
Did you guys know
she lost two sons in Vietnam?

1252
01:20:05,212 --> 01:20:11,003
Why she serves her country is beyond
me, but she's not missed a day's work.

1253
01:20:11,212 --> 01:20:16,525
There's Cathy,
Donna, and Margaret....

1254
01:20:16,732 --> 01:20:19,963
There's something that's
been bothering me.

1255
01:20:20,172 --> 01:20:23,960
- I know it's an inappropriate time.
- What's on your mind?

1256
01:20:24,172 --> 01:20:30,122
I serve the president,
and it's an unforgettable privilege.

1257
01:20:30,332 --> 01:20:32,562
I can't keep this.

1258
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:35,809
It's a white flag of surrender.

1259
01:20:36,012 --> 01:20:39,049
I wanna be a comfort
to my friends in tragedy...

1260
01:20:39,252 --> 01:20:41,561
...and celebrate with them in triumph.

1261
01:20:42,092 --> 01:20:47,371
For the times in between, I wanna
be able to look them in the eye.

1262
01:20:47,572 --> 01:20:51,531
I wanna be with my friends,
my family...

1263
01:20:51,732 --> 01:20:54,166
...and these women.

1264
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,807
Excuse me.

1265
01:21:05,092 --> 01:21:08,289
Thank you.
Friends, please.

1266
01:21:08,532 --> 01:21:10,807
The chili's ready,
I hope you enjoy it.

1267
01:21:11,012 --> 01:21:13,731
Since I told you
you would enjoy it...

1268
01:21:13,932 --> 01:21:16,685
...I'm reasonably certain
that you will.

1269
01:21:18,372 --> 01:21:20,567
The first lady is in Pakistan.

1270
01:21:20,772 --> 01:21:23,650
I'm not entirely sure why,
but I've learned...

1271
01:21:23,852 --> 01:21:27,322
...it's a good idea not to
ask too many questions.

1272
01:21:27,532 --> 01:21:30,683
It seldom leads to anything
but confusion.

1273
01:21:30,892 --> 01:21:35,443
I miss her very much, but I'm delighted
our daughter is here.

1274
01:21:35,772 --> 01:21:39,321
You know, she's starting Georgetown
in the spring.

1275
01:21:41,532 --> 01:21:45,286
This, prior to medical school
and a life of celibacy.

1276
01:21:45,492 --> 01:21:47,687
Yeah, right.

1277
01:21:47,892 --> 01:21:50,087
It's an incredible adventure.

1278
01:21:50,292 --> 01:21:54,331
Four years full of people and
experiences you haven't dreamed of.

1279
01:21:54,532 --> 01:21:57,330
Allow me just one minute of business.

1280
01:21:57,532 --> 01:22:00,444
I hope by the time
our four years are done...

1281
01:22:00,652 --> 01:22:03,291
...we see to it
that anyone who chooses...

1282
01:22:03,492 --> 01:22:07,770
...can go to college,
regardless of their economic status.

1283
01:22:07,972 --> 01:22:09,610
Here, here.

1284
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:15,971
I hear that today was another one of
Leo's "big block of cheese" days.

1285
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:21,530
You all start out cynical, but there's
always one or two converts a day.

1286
01:22:21,732 --> 01:22:25,281
Today was no exception.
C.J. is gonna be up all night...

1287
01:22:25,492 --> 01:22:30,486
....writing a position paper on the
necessity of wildlife protection.

1288
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:34,844
C.J., I don't mind the cost
of this wolves-only highway.

1289
01:22:35,052 --> 01:22:36,531
It's the segregation.

1290
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:40,042
The ACLU will file a petition
on behalf of reindeer...

1291
01:22:40,252 --> 01:22:42,049
...and we're all screwed.

1292
01:22:42,252 --> 01:22:45,244
Sam Seaborn had a guy
who spotted a UFO today.

1293
01:22:45,452 --> 01:22:48,888
He's been thinking about it
ever since.

1294
01:22:49,092 --> 01:22:53,722
It wasn't a ship from another planet,
just another time.

1295
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:55,923
An abandoned Soviet satellite.

1296
01:22:56,132 --> 01:23:00,444
Its booster didn't fire
and it couldn't escape Earth's orbit.

1297
01:23:00,652 --> 01:23:05,521
A reminder of a time when two powerful
nations challenged each other...

1298
01:23:05,732 --> 01:23:09,327
...and then boldly raced
into outer space.

1299
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:11,682
What will be the next challenge...

1300
01:23:12,532 --> 01:23:15,729
...that makes us go farther
and work harder?

1301
01:23:15,932 --> 01:23:18,605
When smallpox was eradicated...

1302
01:23:18,812 --> 01:23:23,602
...it was the greatest humanitarian
achievement of this century.

1303
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:25,962
Surely we can do it again...

1304
01:23:26,172 --> 01:23:29,801
...as when our eyes
looked towards the heavens...

1305
01:23:30,012 --> 01:23:34,051
...and with outstretched fingers,
we touched the face of God.

1306
01:23:35,132 --> 01:23:37,805
Here's to absent friends...

1307
01:23:38,012 --> 01:23:40,970
...and the ones that are here now.

1308
01:24:20,172 --> 01:24:21,127
