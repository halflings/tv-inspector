00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,158
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:11,999
- What's going on?
- Claypool's got your records from rehab.

3
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:15,041
I didn't ask you out,
you asked me out 49 times.

4
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:16,636
I'm saying yes to one.

5
00:00:16,803 --> 00:00:18,031
Do you like opera?

6
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:20,159
- You're asking me out.
- No.

7
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:25,795
I love opera, and with your guarantee
there won't be sex, how can I say no?

8
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:28,921
Lord Marbury.
I was summoned by the president.

9
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,039
We've met, 10 or 12 times.

10
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:35,162
- The world is coming apart.
- Thank God you sent for me!

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:46,793
With 18 million new jobs, wages rising
at twice the rate of inflation...

12
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,636
...the highest home ownership
in history...

13
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:52,476
...the smallest welfare rolls
in years...

14
00:00:52,643 --> 00:00:56,556
...and the lowest peacetime
unemployment since 1957...

15
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:00,238
...I stand here to report
that America has created...

16
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:04,555
...the longest peacetime
economic expansion in our history.

17
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:08,238
For the first time in decades,
the budget is balanced.

18
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:12,715
- From a deficit of $290 million--
- Billion dollars.

19
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:14,999
- What?
- 290 billion.

20
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,195
- What'd I say?
- Million, but let's move on.

21
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,672
- I said million?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:26,998
From a deficit of $290 billion--
It says "million" on the teleprompter.

23
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:28,960
- Sam?
- Our fault.

24
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:30,522
Let's take it back.

25
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:36,361
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President...

26
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:39,242
<i>...members of the 106th Congress....</i>

27
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:44,234
He doesn't look so good.
He's pale and he's sweating.

28
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,439
- Is he sick?
- I don't know.

29
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,833
- Are his glands swollen?
- Damn.

30
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,437
- What?
- Know what I forgot to do?

31
00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:54,163
I forgot to feel
the president's glands.

32
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:59,477
Do you think your joke reflex is why
you have so much trouble with men?

33
00:01:59,643 --> 00:02:05,320
We're 44 hours away from the State of
the Union, and he doesn't look so good.

34
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,757
<i>How do we make...</i>

35
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,796
...the dream of opportunity
a reality for all?

36
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,761
I came to this hallowed chamber
a year ago--

37
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:15,960
We're spelling "hallowed"
with a pound sign?

38
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:17,960
- We'll fix it.
- Is it silent?

39
00:02:18,163 --> 00:02:20,233
Move on, Mr. President.

40
00:02:20,443 --> 00:02:23,879
<i>I came to this hallowed chamber</i>
<i>one year ago...</i>

41
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,597
...to restore the American dream
for all...

42
00:02:26,763 --> 00:02:30,517
...as we gaze at the horizon
of possibilities open to us...

43
00:02:31,163 --> 00:02:33,358
...in the 321st century.

44
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:36,955
Wow, that was ambitious of me,
wasn't it?

45
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's take a break.

46
00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:41,882
- We meant "stronger" here?
- What's it say?

47
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,716
"Our country is stranger
than a year ago."

48
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:47,761
- That's a typo.
- Could go either way.

49
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:49,515
- Sam--
- Taking care of it.

50
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:54,835
- Mr. President, how do you feel?
- Why is everyone asking me that?

51
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:58,359
You don't look so good.
You're pale and perspiring.

52
00:02:58,523 --> 00:03:01,356
- You should take something.
- I take things.

53
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:02,512
What?

54
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,755
My wife hands me pills,
I swallow them.

55
00:03:05,923 --> 00:03:10,713
Vitamin C. Is it possible I'm taking
something called euthanasia?

56
00:03:10,883 --> 00:03:14,558
- Echinacea?
- That sounds more like it.

57
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,042
I'm taking pills.

58
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:20,481
Are you actually taking them,
or just carrying them around?

59
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:24,682
- Carrying them around was a big step.
- You gotta take them.

60
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:29,240
How do we make the American dream
a reality for all who work for it?

61
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:32,440
- You gotta add "who work for it."
- That was me.

62
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,639
We decided this two months ago.

63
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:37,033
Polls say we need
"who work for it"...

64
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:40,195
...and "The era of big government
is over."

65
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:42,479
- When did this happen?
- In a meeting.

66
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:44,241
You wanna offend the poor?

67
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:47,879
- The ones we offend won't watch.
- Can't imagine why not.

68
00:03:48,043 --> 00:03:51,353
It's what they want on welfare reform,
so screw it.

69
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,198
When the Ghost of Christmas Future
visits, don't run to me.

70
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:59,151
- Damn! You're who I was gonna run to.
- You don't look good.

71
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:03,595
I'm gazing into the 321st century.
There's a lot on my mind.

72
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,799
Let's finish up in here.

73
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,563
- Oh, God. I will take the pills.
- Now?

74
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:11,152
Yes. I will pour a glass of water...

75
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:15,521
...from the glass pitcher, a gift
from the Christian Charity Network.

76
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:19,517
I'm just saying, before you call me
Ebenezer, remember...

77
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:23,039
...I got a nice pitcher
for just being a good guy.

78
00:04:23,243 --> 00:04:25,711
You turned me right around
on that one.

79
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:28,358
I will take the pills.

80
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,673
You know, here's a thing.

81
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:34,437
- We haven't been invited.
- What?

82
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:38,033
The speaker invites the president
to deliver the speech.

83
00:04:38,243 --> 00:04:40,996
- And we haven't been invited yet?
- Not yet.

84
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,838
- Is somebody seeing to this?
- I will.

85
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:48,561
Good. We can report the country's
stranger than it was a year ago.

86
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:50,674
I'm never gonna live it down.

87
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:58,994
- Liberty's down. We're in the Oval.
- Get a doctor!

88
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:49,958
His temperature's 101.9.

89
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:54,554
I'm fairly sure it's the flu,
but I'll take him for a cardiogram.

90
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:57,641
I don't need a cardiogram.
I got dizzy.

91
00:05:57,843 --> 00:06:01,074
- We're going.
- I didn't have a heart attack.

92
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,638
It's the flu.
I don't need a cardiogram.

93
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:07,153
- We'll do blood work and an x-ray.
- Think it's pneumonia?

94
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:10,993
I think it's the flu.
But I don't want to fool around.

95
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,512
- Leo, I'm fine.
- Mr. President.

96
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:17,073
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham.
How do I look to you?

97
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:20,355
- You're a very handsome man.
- You see?

98
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:23,802
- What do you think?
- It can wait until morning.

99
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,641
But I'll stay for a while.

100
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:29,552
Do the blood work now,
the cardiogram and x-ray tomorrow.

101
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,841
Sure.

102
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:35,877
- You're going to bed.
- Can't yet. Situation Room.

103
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,037
Let's do this.
Then you're going to bed.

104
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:42,713
We'll meet you in the residence
in a few minutes.

105
00:06:44,923 --> 00:06:47,995
- Just a little joke.
- You're a real cutup.

106
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:51,315
- 101.9, and I still got it.
- Yes. Indeed, sir.

107
00:06:53,723 --> 00:06:58,319
I'll tell him steady but not
egregious. Are we all okay with that?

108
00:06:58,523 --> 00:07:00,354
- Admiral.
- What do you got?

109
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:04,158
We got the 2nd, 3rd,
103rd, 106th, and the 107th.

110
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:05,952
Thank you.

111
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:10,441
- Anybody know if the Celtics won?
- We can get that information.

112
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:11,632
What happened?

113
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:15,518
There have been steady clashes
along the cease-fire line.

114
00:07:15,723 --> 00:07:21,116
Look at the photos. India's moved
new units into their force structures.

115
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,962
There's four days left
on the cease-fire.

116
00:07:24,163 --> 00:07:27,235
- They're getting ready.
- What about Pakistan?

117
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:30,321
They say that
if the Indians continue...

118
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:33,401
...they can't defend
with conventional forces.

119
00:07:33,603 --> 00:07:35,673
Is this whining or for real?

120
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:39,722
Bazin's given control of nuclear
weapons to field commanders.

121
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:41,515
They just want attention.

122
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:44,556
- They've got mine.
- And they've got China's.

123
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:49,041
I'm gonna scramble the B-1s
and put the 49th Tactical on alert.

124
00:07:49,243 --> 00:07:52,519
I'm going to bed.
Call me if there's movement.

125
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,515
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,002
- Mr. President.
- Yeah?

127
00:07:59,243 --> 00:08:01,882
- The Celtics lost in overtime.
- Good night.

128
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,434
Thank you, Mr. President.

129
00:08:04,643 --> 00:08:07,555
- It was very cute.
- So I grow the beard back?

130
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:09,674
- Yeah.
- Okay.

131
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:15,473
- Didn't he look cute with a full beard?
- I've never thought about it.

132
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,002
- Take your time.
- What?

133
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,633
- I came to see my fish.
- It's fine. I need my office.

134
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,481
- I'm leaving?
- Yes.

135
00:08:22,643 --> 00:08:24,873
- Good night.
- Good night.

136
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:30,832
He gave me a fish a few weeks ago.

137
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:31,992
That one there.

138
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:36,640
- It won't kill you to be friendlier.
- It doesn't seem to kill you.

139
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:38,322
What do you need?

140
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,912
- Are you kidding?
- Yes. I was kidding.

141
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:43,876
- You sounded serious.
- I'm very dry.

142
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:46,398
- The story's breaking.
- How do you know?

143
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:50,118
- It's on the Internet.
- The whole thing? I'll go see him.

144
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:54,113
We weren't invited?
I thought it was a requirement.

145
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,272
It is.

146
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:58,082
- But we have to be invited?
- A technicality.

147
00:08:58,283 --> 00:09:02,356
It dates back to Parliament,
what do you want from me?

148
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:08,836
- Also, remind Josh to pick a guy.
- Pick a guy?

149
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,275
- He'll know what it means?
- Yes.

150
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:15,841
- Because I don't know--
- Margaret!

151
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:19,238
- Excuse me.
- Hey, C.J.

152
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:24,160
- What's going on?
- How's the president?

153
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,752
- In bed.
- Does the first lady know?

154
00:09:26,963 --> 00:09:30,478
She canceled the trip.
She's on her way back.

155
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:31,997
Leo....

156
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:35,318
It's gonna break. Tomorrow?

157
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:39,436
Yeah. It's on the Internet right now.

158
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,997
Why don't we do a preemptive--?
You'll talk to the press.

159
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,320
I'm gonna work with you first, okay?

160
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:58,476
<i>It tested very well.</i>

161
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:02,792
I'm not saying we're doing it,
I just want to try it out.

162
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,801
The era of big government is over.

163
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:08,119
All right, thanks.

164
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:10,592
How you feeling?

165
00:10:10,923 --> 00:10:15,041
Roughly the same as when you
asked me four minutes ago.

166
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:16,915
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

167
00:10:17,123 --> 00:10:21,878
This isn't the worst of it. The worst
is coming up the stairs right now.

168
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:29,081
- Good evening.
- Charlie, how are you doing?

169
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:32,679
I'm Admiral Hacket,
I was on duty when it happened.

170
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,000
Good to meet you.
Would you get me my bag?

171
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:41,320
Now, 101.9.
When's the last time you checked?

172
00:10:41,523 --> 00:10:43,354
- About an hour ago.
- Pressure?

173
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:47,761
- It dropped before, but it's back.
- 105/70.

174
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:52,875
I want to put him on IV saline
and vitamin solution. Still dizzy?

175
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,478
I was wondering when you'd notice me.

176
00:10:55,683 --> 00:11:00,359
Are you still dizzy? He's lying.
Give him Flumadine, twice a day.

177
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:03,999
Would you mind waiting outside
for a minute?

178
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:08,112
Would you mind waiting outside?

179
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:10,234
- Need anything?
- No, thanks.

180
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:13,196
You're very sexy
when you're in doctor mode.

181
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:19,239
"Get me an IV-- Saline solution and
100 milligrams of Flumadine. Stat."

182
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:23,799
- I could jump you right now.
- I could kill you right now.

183
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:28,235
- My thing's more fun.
- It took you 25 minutes to call me?

184
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:32,914
Fitzwallace called.
There was more movement in Kashmir.

185
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:37,241
I don't care if Canada
invaded Michigan. You call me.

186
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,638
- Abbey?
- Stop talking.

187
00:11:40,523 --> 00:11:43,321
I broke the pitcher
in the Oval Office.

188
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,556
It's okay.

189
00:11:46,843 --> 00:11:49,915
Seriously, Abbey, I'm fine.

190
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:52,593
You could've hit your head.

191
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:54,202
But I didn't.

192
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:04,200
- Was it like the time in Nantucket?
- Yeah.

193
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:09,272
- Or was it more like at my parents?
- I really don't remember.

194
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,641
It's all right.

195
00:12:13,323 --> 00:12:16,838
Close your eyes.
You're gonna be asleep in a minute.

196
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:22,800
The Pakistanis are giving control
of nuclear weapons to the field.

197
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:28,002
It's okay.
Leo's in the west wing.

198
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:31,913
- Just go to sleep.
- I'm sorry about the pitcher.

199
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:36,078
- I was taking the pills you gave me.
- Go to sleep, baby.

200
00:12:36,283 --> 00:12:39,719
- I could jump you right now.
- Yeah, sure you could.

201
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:07,358
I don't think it's in the mailroom.

202
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:13,160
It's an invitation to the president.
I'm assuming it was hand-delivered.

203
00:13:13,363 --> 00:13:16,355
- Thank you. Yes?
- Margaret came by.

204
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,361
She said to remind you
you need to pick a guy.

205
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,157
She said you'd know what that means.
Do you?

206
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,796
- Yeah.
- I don't.

207
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:27,712
Someone from the line of succession
has to miss the speech.

208
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:30,801
Why? Wait, I know why.

209
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:33,597
If the building's blown up--
Who will it be?

210
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,317
- Who should I pick?
- You should pick me.

211
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,241
- You think so?
- I'd be good.

212
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,240
You're in the line of succession?

213
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:44,880
If somebody blows up the Capitol
during the speech, I'd move up.

214
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:47,074
- Fair point.
- Who's it gonna be?

215
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:50,002
- Roger Tribby.
- Secretary of agriculture?

216
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,001
Listen, be sweet to Margaret
and Leo today.

217
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:57,481
It's not the worst day of their lives,
but it'll be in the top five.

218
00:13:57,683 --> 00:13:59,196
See you later.

219
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:07,837
"I deeply regret the pain and trouble
this has caused the people in my life."

220
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:11,956
When you left Sierra Tucson,
did you start attending meetings?

221
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:15,394
- AA meetings?
- Don't say AA if they don't.

222
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:19,198
After you left Sierra Tucson,
did you attend meetings?

223
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,394
- Do you still attend them?
- Yes.

224
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,279
Where?

225
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:29,440
I won't answer that.

226
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,203
- How often?
- I won't answer that either.

227
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:35,236
- How about, "As often as I need to"?
- Need?

228
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:36,512
Don't answer it.

229
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:39,157
- What else?
- Has the president known?

230
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:43,841
The president and I have a long
history and a close relationship.

231
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:46,318
You didn't answer the question.

232
00:14:46,523 --> 00:14:50,880
The president has known, as well
as the FBI and the Secret Service.

233
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,200
Did they object to you
being in such a position?

234
00:14:54,403 --> 00:14:58,282
Yeah, they were worried I'd sell
state secrets to Bolivia--

235
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,997
It's not an unreasonable question.

236
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,632
I'm all set.

237
00:15:06,803 --> 00:15:10,352
I wrote a draft of the president's
statement of support.

238
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,962
What did you do?

239
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:14,119
I wrote the statement of support.

240
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:16,359
- Why?
- The president's condition--

241
00:15:16,563 --> 00:15:18,519
I know what condition he's in.

242
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:23,114
- Who told you to write it?
- Toby told him last night.

243
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,439
Nobody had to tell me, it's my job.

244
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:29,352
No! Your job is to protect
the president.

245
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:33,636
Do me a favor, don't show initiative,
don't rush to my defense.

246
00:15:33,843 --> 00:15:36,357
I don't want to see you
on <i>Crossfire</i>...

247
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:41,921
...I don't wanna read your name unless
it supports the president's agenda.

248
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,794
I go down, I go down.
I'm not taking anyone with me.

249
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:52,595
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

250
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,836
I'm all set. Go back to work.

251
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:11,274
The good news is,
your temperature's gone down.

252
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:13,201
- Can I go to the office?
- No.

253
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:16,042
It's gonna go back up again.

254
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,552
- Why?
- Because you have the flu.

255
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:21,355
Here's the thing, though.

256
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,351
- I never saw you study in med school.
- Deep breath.

257
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,999
Do you even know what
you're listening for right now?

258
00:16:29,643 --> 00:16:33,795
- Know how many men I could've married?
- How many?

259
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,360
I'm going to the office.

260
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,595
Okay.

261
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:41,555
- Really?
- Feel free.

262
00:16:48,363 --> 00:16:50,399
Anything else?

263
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:56,032
All right. I think I'll stay here
for a little bit.

264
00:17:01,443 --> 00:17:02,922
They're ready for you.

265
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:05,512
- You need anything?
- No.

266
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,275
- Good morning.
- Morning.

267
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:18,152
A story which most of you
are aware of already...

268
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:21,799
...will break in wide circulation
by the end of the day.

269
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:27,635
I'd like to read a brief statement
before I answer your questions.

270
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:33,602
In June of 1993,
I voluntarily admitted myself...

271
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,000
...to the Sierra Tucson
rehabilitation facility...

272
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:40,878
...to treat an addiction
to alcohol and Valium.

273
00:17:44,483 --> 00:17:48,158
I am a recovering alcoholic
and drug addict.

274
00:17:49,763 --> 00:17:55,076
I deeply regret the pain and trouble
this has caused people in my life.

275
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,673
I'd like to, at this point,
clarify a few things....

276
00:18:01,683 --> 00:18:03,116
Roger Tribby.

277
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:06,598
Why the secretary of agriculture?

278
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:11,638
The secretaries of state and defense
are famous faces for the camera.

279
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:16,553
So if it blows up, my country will
look to the secretary of agriculture.

280
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,438
- It's my country too.
- Yeah, but you'll be dead.

281
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:24,158
I don't anticipate
the Capitol building exploding.

282
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:27,002
When have things exploding
been anticipated?

283
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,434
- Now you're bringing me down.
- I would think so.

284
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:33,556
I thought he did well.

285
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:35,242
Yeah. He did.

286
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:40,471
I read the statement you wrote.
Great. I'm sorry no one will read it.

287
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:44,392
The president will. He is right now.
I don't care.

288
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:48,755
- Leo's gonna kill us.
- I don't care. Do you?

289
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:50,555
No.

290
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:56,315
Toby, the speech contains positions
Democrats aren't on board with yet.

291
00:18:56,523 --> 00:18:58,559
They can write their own speech.

292
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:03,234
But they're the ones who have to run
against this a year from now.

293
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:04,722
What's your concern?

294
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:08,040
- We feel, even in this draft--
- You've made progress.

295
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:13,078
But there's too much emphasis
on the role of the federal government.

296
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:15,194
- I've pared down.
- We know.

297
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:25,275
This is an opportunity for a pep rally,
to trumpet government.

298
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,680
Why do we want to pretend
to be sorry for intruding?

299
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,192
That's what people
want to hear.

300
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:32,961
So I've been told.

301
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:37,520
Pick a section, fight with me,
I'll lose and call in the next group.

302
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:39,918
- You understand--
- Pick a section.

303
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:43,194
There's a line waiting outside.

304
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:46,952
I've got 31 hours to finish
writing this....

305
00:19:48,483 --> 00:19:51,714
- We don't--
- Federal funding for the arts.

306
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:55,002
The NEA.

307
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,917
Let us open our hymnals to page 22.

308
00:20:18,523 --> 00:20:19,672
- Leo?
- Yeah?

309
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:22,761
- Mallory's here.
- Okay.

310
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:25,636
- Dad.
- Hey, Mal.

311
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:26,878
Are you okay?

312
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,722
You told me it was gonna be
this afternoon.

313
00:20:29,923 --> 00:20:31,754
I told you that it probably--

314
00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:35,433
I wanted to be there.
Mom and I should have been there.

315
00:20:35,643 --> 00:20:39,192
A picture of me standing next
to my estranged wife is--

316
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,154
I don't want to fight.

317
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,473
Okay. Anyway--

318
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,516
- I saw the president's statement.
- Statement?

319
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:53,033
For the press, supporting you.
It's floating around.

320
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:58,363
- It's floating around.
- It's very moving. He loves you.

321
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:00,315
Excuse me.

322
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,202
- Sam.
- Yeah?

323
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,878
- Where we at?
- We're getting slapped around on the NEA.

324
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:11,473
Man, why is he--?
On the NEA he's putting up a fight?

325
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:14,680
- You did it again.
- Leo....

326
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:16,475
I know you're pissed--

327
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:19,277
- Has the president seen it?
- Yes, and he--

328
00:21:19,483 --> 00:21:22,281
Who gave it to him?

329
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:23,757
- I did.
- I did.

330
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:27,558
- You're giving me Abbott and Costello?
- I did.

331
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:32,600
- I told you--
- They want to tear you down.

332
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,192
They don't like you,
so they do this.

333
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:37,633
And for us not to defend you....

334
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:42,076
I disobeyed you, I apologize.
But that's the way it is.

335
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:45,798
- The first lady's in your office.
- Thank you.

336
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:54,082
This is not what I wanted.

337
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:05,321
- You've got an itch for Sam Seaborn.
- I do not have an itch.

338
00:22:05,523 --> 00:22:08,117
- You want some free advice?
- Sure.

339
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:12,032
Don't go for the geniuses.
They never want to sleep.

340
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:15,676
Oh, Leo, hi.

341
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:18,721
I hope I didn't take you away
from anything.

342
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:20,879
I do not have an itch.

343
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:22,952
I'm going.

344
00:22:23,163 --> 00:22:25,597
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Daddy.

345
00:22:34,683 --> 00:22:36,833
You did good today.

346
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:40,640
- Thank you.
- Mallory's very proud of you.

347
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:42,871
Well....

348
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:47,918
Do you think there's a huge downside
to postponing for a few days?

349
00:22:48,123 --> 00:22:51,638
- Did his fever go back up?
- No, it's going down.

350
00:22:52,363 --> 00:22:54,433
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

351
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:57,237
What should I know
that I don't know?

352
00:22:57,443 --> 00:23:00,116
- Just to be--
- Why'd you cancel your trip?

353
00:23:00,323 --> 00:23:03,121
Because the president
has a temperature.

354
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,281
The president's not in nursery school.

355
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:11,320
- If it's a problem to postpone--
- It's not a problem to postpone.

356
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:15,192
I won't let anything jeopardize
the president's health.

357
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,473
- What I'm saying--
- Leo, please.

358
00:23:19,923 --> 00:23:21,675
This is me.

359
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:26,317
This has happened before.

360
00:23:26,523 --> 00:23:29,640
I see you trying to cover the panic.

361
00:23:30,203 --> 00:23:35,152
I see you prescribing medication.
I think you're giving him shots.

362
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:39,834
What does he have
he can't tell people?

363
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:43,395
He has the flu.

364
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:45,833
You wouldn't have come back
for that.

365
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:47,601
He fainted.

366
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,363
He was running a fever.

367
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:01,232
He has multiple sclerosis.

368
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,114
Oh, Abbey.

369
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:11,876
A fever could be life-threatening.

370
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:26,714
<i>Mrs. Green, there are things</i>
<i>you must never say to Chief Bennett.</i>

371
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:29,756
<i>He's married to someone else,</i>
<i>and so are you.</i>

372
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:32,682
Don't any of these characters
have jobs?

373
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:37,035
I don't know.
I think one of them is a surgeon.

374
00:24:37,243 --> 00:24:41,236
They seem to have a lot of free time
in the middle of the day.

375
00:24:42,083 --> 00:24:43,357
Hello?

376
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:46,475
She's changed her clothes a lot
for one day.

377
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,801
Mr. McGarry's outside.

378
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:52,601
Yeah. Would you mind
stepping out, Charlie?

379
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:09,120
Abbey phoned and told me
about your conversation.

380
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:14,712
It was diagnosed 7 years ago.
My life expectancy is normal.

381
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:18,472
My particular course of MS
is called relapsing-remitting...

382
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,198
...which means I should experience
total recovery.

383
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:27,158
Abbey gives me injections of Betaseron
that reduces the frequency.

384
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:31,515
Fever and stress tend to be two things
that'll induce an attack.

385
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:36,433
You're president,
the State of the Union is tomorrow...

386
00:25:36,643 --> 00:25:41,114
...lndia and Pakistan have nuclear
weapons, you have a 102-degree fever.

387
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:44,554
- So I guess we're out of the woods.
- 101.9.

388
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:48,551
Jed, of all the things
that you could have kept from me.

389
00:25:48,763 --> 00:25:51,675
You haven't called me Jed
since I was elected.

390
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,351
Why didn't you tell me?

391
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:58,315
I wanted to be president.

392
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,436
I still would've got you here.
I could've been a friend.

393
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,232
- You've been a friend.
- But when it was time--

394
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:12,314
When I was lying in a parking lot,
you were the one I called.

395
00:26:12,523 --> 00:26:16,357
When you stood up there today,
I was so proud.

396
00:26:16,563 --> 00:26:20,112
- No.
- I tried to get up and fell down again.

397
00:26:20,963 --> 00:26:22,715
I know the feeling.

398
00:26:25,403 --> 00:26:28,793
I'm so sorry, Leo, I really am.

399
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:33,802
Mr. President?

400
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,313
Don't worry about it.

401
00:26:37,523 --> 00:26:40,595
- Yeah, Charlie?
- Lord Marbury.

402
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:43,363
Give us a minute,
would you please?

403
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:53,482
The president's proposing that the NEA
budget be increased by 50% ?

404
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:59,082
The National Endowment amounts to
less than 1/100th of 1%...

405
00:26:59,283 --> 00:27:04,357
...of the total federal budget.
It costs taxpayers 39 cents a year.

406
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:08,681
The arts budget for the U.S.
is equivalent to that of Sweden.

407
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:12,432
With such a big deal being made
out of Mapplethorpe--

408
00:27:12,643 --> 00:27:13,758
Are you gay-bashing?

409
00:27:13,963 --> 00:27:17,842
All we'd like is for you
to not mention the NEA.

410
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:21,672
I don't know what to tell people
who say that the NEA...

411
00:27:21,883 --> 00:27:24,556
...supports art nobody
wants to pay for...

412
00:27:24,763 --> 00:27:29,962
...or people who say Rodgers and Hart
didn't need the NEA to write <i>Oklahoma!</i>

413
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:35,283
And Arthur Murray didn't need the NEA
to write <i>Death of a Salesman.</i>

414
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:40,802
I'd tell them that Rodgers and
Hammerstein wrote <i>Oklahoma!</i>...

415
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:42,999
...and Arthur Murray taught dance.

416
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:48,323
Arthur Miller did need the NEA
to write <i>Death of a Salesman.</i>

417
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:52,362
It was called the WPA back then.
It was Roosevelt's--

418
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,643
It was Roosevelt's--

419
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:04,557
Toby?

420
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:09,272
Yeah?

421
00:28:09,483 --> 00:28:12,395
You stopped talking
in the middle of a....

422
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:19,559
Thank you, everybody,
this meeting's over.

423
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:25,160
There are marvelous flu remedies
known in parts of the subcontinent.

424
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:29,879
Licorice root combined with bamboo sap
and a strong shot of whiskey.

425
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,553
Ginger root also,
mixed with citrus peel.

426
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,955
- And a shot of whiskey?
- Yes.

427
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:39,917
In fact, you can throw out
the ginger root and citrus peel.

428
00:28:40,123 --> 00:28:42,353
What have you got for me, John?

429
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:49,720
After speaking with your secretaries
of state and defense...

430
00:28:49,923 --> 00:28:51,117
...I believe this:

431
00:28:51,603 --> 00:28:52,877
Buy them off.

432
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:56,392
Buy them?

433
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,033
- Yes, sir.
- How?

434
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:03,794
For centuries, my kingdom has
ruled India with a stick and carrot.

435
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:08,281
When we had a problem with someone,
we'd make him a maharajah.

436
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:10,792
That's a kind of regional king.

437
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:14,996
We'd pay him off with an annual
tribute. In return he'd be...

438
00:29:15,163 --> 00:29:16,676
...loyal to the Crown.

439
00:29:16,883 --> 00:29:22,003
Under our Constitution, the president
is not empowered to create maharajahs.

440
00:29:22,203 --> 00:29:26,196
Thanks for clearing that up.
Having been educated at Cambridge...

441
00:29:26,403 --> 00:29:28,633
...I am, as you know, quite stupid.

442
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:32,358
- John, please.
- You've always paid the world off.

443
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:36,397
During the cold war,
you paid dictators to be on your side.

444
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:40,681
To this day, you pay North Korea
not to develop nuclear weapons.

445
00:29:42,843 --> 00:29:45,676
- What does India want?
- Computer industry.

446
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:49,512
They require an infrastructure,
which you can give them.

447
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:51,076
Why?

448
00:29:51,243 --> 00:29:54,838
- It's the price you pay.
- To avoid a war so far away?

449
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,956
For being rich, free and alive
all at the same time.

450
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,597
And for the neglect of Congress...

451
00:30:01,803 --> 00:30:06,923
...in not checking the proliferation
of nuclear devices.

452
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:11,160
- Your friend, the prime minister--
- Ricky.

453
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:13,752
He's gonna go for this?

454
00:30:15,443 --> 00:30:18,480
If it's handled properly.

455
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:23,718
Tell the ambassador
we'll discuss this in three months.

456
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:27,159
In three months.
This isn't like quid pro quo.

457
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:31,555
That's the carrot.
Leo, what's the stick?

458
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:36,513
In 24 hours, we want recon photos
of Indian divisions retreating.

459
00:30:36,723 --> 00:30:40,432
If we don't, we're gonna seize
Indian assets in the U.S.

460
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,953
So will our NATO allies.
G-7 will call in its loans.

461
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:49,840
They put command control in the field
and we get physical. Let them know.

462
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:52,273
Well, now I have my instructions.

463
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:56,874
Talk to the ambassador.
I want to have photos in 24 hours.

464
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:02,313
- Mr. President?
- Yes, Charlie.

465
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,721
- Toby's here.
- Come in.

466
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:08,154
- I'm gonna go back to the office.
- Let's hope.

467
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,082
Hey, Toby.

468
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:13,753
- How are you feeling?
- Much better, thank you.

469
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:19,674
I was watching a program before
with a sort of a roving moderator...

470
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:24,832
...who spoke to a panel of young women
who were having boyfriend trouble...

471
00:31:25,043 --> 00:31:28,638
...because the boys had slept
with the girlfriends' moms.

472
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,040
Then the boys came out
and they all fought.

473
00:31:32,243 --> 00:31:36,202
Toby, tell me.
These people don't vote, do they?

474
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:38,041
I wouldn't think so, no.

475
00:31:38,243 --> 00:31:40,882
- Excuse me.
- What do you need, Josh?

476
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,472
I asked Josh to join me here, sir.

477
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:48,153
What's on your mind?

478
00:31:48,363 --> 00:31:51,958
The era of big government is over.

479
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,639
You wanna cut the line?

480
00:31:58,243 --> 00:32:01,553
I wanna change the sentiment.

481
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:08,196
We're running away from ourselves.
I know we can score that way...

482
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:13,272
...I was an architect of that
campaign strategy along with Josh.

483
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:16,443
But we're here now.

484
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:22,877
Tomorrow night we do an immense thing.
We have to say what we feel.

485
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:28,392
That government, no matter what its
past failures, and in times to come...

486
00:32:28,603 --> 00:32:32,881
...government can be a place
where people come together...

487
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,837
...and where no one gets left behind.

488
00:32:37,043 --> 00:32:39,193
No one...

489
00:32:40,803 --> 00:32:43,397
...gets left behind.

490
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:47,632
An instrument of good.

491
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:54,962
I have no trouble understanding
why the line tested well.

492
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:58,872
But I don't think that means
we should say it, it means...

493
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,517
...we should change it.

494
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:10,433
I think so too.

495
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:13,759
What do you think, Josh?

496
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:19,955
I make it a point never to disagree
with Toby when he's right.

497
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:28,156
Then you and Sam get your people
together and get to work.

498
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:32,000
Thank you, Mr. President.

499
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,397
Thank you.

500
00:33:47,563 --> 00:33:50,157
You're mad that Danny
flirted with Mandy.

501
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:52,791
- Did I say that?
- I read between the lines.

502
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:54,197
There are no lines.

503
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:56,598
It can be pretty confusing.

504
00:33:56,803 --> 00:34:01,354
With Mallory, I don't know if she
likes me, hates me or is indifferent.

505
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:05,516
I just wish she'd get past it
so we could move on.

506
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,712
- You wrote the statement about my dad?
- Yes.

507
00:34:21,883 --> 00:34:24,875
- Well, now I'm even more confused.
- Yes.

508
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:28,240
Though I gotta say,
I'm enjoying being a writer.

509
00:34:30,923 --> 00:34:35,280
- Is Danny Concanon in the press room?
- Yeah.

510
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:38,953
Would you have him
come to my office, please?

511
00:34:41,643 --> 00:34:46,000
I wanna take your temperature
one last time.

512
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:50,634
You took it 14 times in three hours.
You're not taking it again.

513
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,641
At least not with a thermometer.

514
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:56,271
If you wanna take it recreationally--

515
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,917
There's something wrong with you.

516
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:01,956
Why is "hallowed" spelled
with a pound sign?

517
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:04,353
I stopped asking those questions.

518
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:18,193
- Yes?
- It's C.J.

519
00:35:19,803 --> 00:35:22,681
- Okay.
- Can I come in?

520
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:25,152
- C.J., this is your office.
- Right.

521
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:34,880
- Hello.
- Hello.

522
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:42,595
So you have asked me out many times,
I have said no.

523
00:35:42,803 --> 00:35:45,920
- You said yes once.
- To a business dinner.

524
00:35:46,083 --> 00:35:50,634
Nonetheless, I do seem to have
a preoccupation...

525
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:53,755
...a sort of girlish, I suppose, thing.

526
00:35:53,963 --> 00:35:59,435
Please don't be mislead
by anything....

527
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:03,199
In fact, let me
put it this way--

528
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:06,321
I'm supposed to write
about the speech.

529
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:10,232
My paper wants me to see it.
If you could move this along....

530
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:13,600
I thought I'd kiss you,
you know, on the mouth...

531
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:18,317
...and then I'd just get past it.

532
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:21,441
I'd get past it,
and then I'd be able to...

533
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:27,041
...give my work the kind of
concentration it really deserves.

534
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:29,275
Okay.

535
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,835
- How's right here?
- That's fine.

536
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:36,034
- Be careful of the fish.
- Sure.

537
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:40,080
I'm saying, because
if you rock against the....

538
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:54,636
- How's that?
- Oh, good.

539
00:36:54,843 --> 00:36:56,754
- Past it?
- Yeah.

540
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:59,682
Okay, I've gotta go now.

541
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,915
- Taking that fish with you?
- No.

542
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:10,756
- Walked into that door there.
- Yes.

543
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:25,113
You're too fixed on Western medicine.
Bamboo sap, a gambir twig--

544
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:28,480
- And a shot of whiskey.
- You're all set.

545
00:37:28,683 --> 00:37:30,719
- Good evening.
- Mr. President.

546
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,471
Well, now, if I'm not mistaken...

547
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:39,039
...this is a photograph
of Indian troops in retreat.

548
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:43,118
So is that, and so is this.

549
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,033
Thank you, John.

550
00:37:46,203 --> 00:37:49,912
I'm leaving to see Ricky in an hour.
Many things to settle.

551
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:53,718
- Godspeed, your Lordship.
- Thank you, sir.

552
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:55,236
Abigail.

553
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:02,071
- Good luck, John.
- Good luck to you too, Leo.

554
00:38:02,243 --> 00:38:03,562
Thank you.

555
00:38:03,723 --> 00:38:06,681
I'm off!

556
00:38:09,563 --> 00:38:12,555
Friends, let me
have your attention, please.

557
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:17,838
A lot of time, energy,
passion, wit, skill and talent...

558
00:38:18,043 --> 00:38:19,761
...went into drafting this.

559
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:24,678
You may not see it in my performance,
but it is an extraordinary speech.

560
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:30,196
I say thee yea, Toby Ziegler!
I say thee yea, Sam Seaborn!

561
00:38:31,963 --> 00:38:36,195
Motorcade's ready, the agriculture
secretary's at the Oval Office.

562
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:42,994
- Roger.
- Good evening.

563
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,637
Sorry you drew
the short straw on this.

564
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:49,756
We'll miss you tonight.
Next year it's the surgeon general.

565
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:54,639
- You can watch on TV in my study.
- Thank you, sir. I brought you a gift.

566
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:59,642
- I know you love all things ancient.
- What is it?

567
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:03,159
Someone translated
our Constitution into Latin.

568
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:07,402
I think it was a high school project,
and it got published.

569
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:10,034
Oh, this is magnificent.

570
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:14,634
I highlighted an appropriate passage
from the executive powers section.

571
00:39:14,803 --> 00:39:16,316
Can you translate?

572
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,753
"He shall, from time to time...

573
00:39:21,963 --> 00:39:26,639
...give to the Congress information
of the State of the Union...

574
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:29,954
...and recommend to their
consideration such measures...

575
00:39:30,123 --> 00:39:34,036
...as he shall judge necessary
and expedient."

576
00:39:34,243 --> 00:39:36,916
Sounds right up your alley, sir.

577
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:42,238
- Thanks, Roger.
- Knock them dead, sir.

578
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:48,553
Oh, Roger. If anything happened,
you know what to do, right?

579
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:52,312
- I hadn't thought about it.
- First is national security.

580
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:57,193
Appoint joint chiefs, appoint a
chairman, take us to DefCon 4.

581
00:39:57,403 --> 00:40:00,156
Have emergency delegates sent
to Washington.

582
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:03,400
The assistant attorney general
becomes the acting AG.

583
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:07,841
If he tells you to bring out the
National Guard, do what he says.

584
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:13,119
- You got a best friend?
- Yes, sir.

585
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:16,315
- Is he smarter than you?
- Yes, sir.

586
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:20,152
- Would you trust him with your life?
- Yes, sir.

587
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:23,116
That's your chief of staff.

588
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:33,991
In the residence,
on the second floor...

589
00:40:34,203 --> 00:40:39,231
...you have to jiggle the handle
on the toilet or it'll....

590
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:42,276
I gotta go.

591
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:44,162
You'll do fine.

592
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:47,998
- People have phenomenal capacity.
- Yes, sir.

593
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:49,552
