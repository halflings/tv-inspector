<i>Previously: on "The West Wing"</i>

2
00:00:08,923 --> 00:00:11,801
India sent troops
in to the neutral zone in Kashmir.

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,563
- This happend Last night?
- It wasn't ready for press yet.

4
00:00:14,763 --> 00:00:17,960
You could have told me before sending me in there.
C.J....
I flatly denied it.

5
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,961
- I met with Butterfield and some
Secret Service agents this morning.
- What did I do?

6
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:23,438
It's Time for me to tell you about some letters we've been getting.

7
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:29,320
Two death threats were recieved earlyer in the week.
Sir, I'm farely convinced we're looking two fiveteen year old boys.

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,638
There’s another one.
Two politicians are having an argument.

9
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:41,236
One of them stands up and shouts, "You’re lying!"
The other one says, "Yes, I am, but hear me out."

10
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:47,791
<i>- Mr. President, We have time for one more question.</i>
<i>- I don’t think I answered the last one yet.</i>
<i>Suzanne’s got me telling jokes.</i>

11
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:53,202
<i>Suzanne there is an answer to your question but</i>
<i>I don’t think you’re going to like it. You ready?</i>

12
00:00:53,403 --> 00:00:56,201
<i>the current crop of 18-25 year olds...</i>

13
00:00:56,403 --> 00:01:00,112
<i>... is the most politically apathetic generation</i>
<i> in American history.</i>

14
00:01:00,323 --> 00:01:05,795
In 1972, half of that age group voted.
In the last election, it was 32 percent.

15
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:09,552
Your generation is considerably less
likely than any previous one...

16
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:15,201
...to write or call public officials,
attend rallies, or work on political campaigns.

17
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:19,555
A man once said this, "decisions are made
by those who show up.

18
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:23,961
So are we failing you, or are you failing us?
It's a little of both.

19
00:01:24,163 --> 00:01:25,960
...there’s a guy on my staff who showed me a report

20
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:29,394
We're moments away.
I'm going to get the door.

21
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:35,553
from the Center of Policy Alternatives that said
- 61% of your age group agree with the statement "Politicians
and political officials"...

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,799
<i>...failed my generation. "</i>

23
00:01:38,003 --> 00:01:41,313
<i>When asked how older generations</i>
<i>see you, you said:</i>

24
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:42,876
<i>"Lazy and unfocused. "</i>

25
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:46,439
- What source?
- The Center for Policy Alternatives.

26
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:48,759
C.J. will have copies.

27
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:51,158
<i>"--determined and independent. "</i>

28
00:01:52,643 --> 00:01:56,921
I want to continue, but there was
some debate among my staff...

29
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,762
...if I should take off my jacket
or not.

30
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:03,399
Some thought it would fit
with the folksy atmosphere.

31
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:07,437
Others thought it not presidential.
Read nothing into it...

32
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:12,273
...other than I've been talking for
two hours under these hot lights.

33
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,474
Thank you.

34

- Why?

36

- The signal.
- Thought it was for the other thing.

- It's for this thing now.
- When did that happen?

- From where?
- A three-hour patrol of the no-fly.

94
00:07:36,043 --> 00:07:40,195
- Iraq. We have an F-117 down in Iraq.
- Along with a pilot.

95
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:42,121
- How much of this is confirmed?
- None of it.

96

- I need ten more minutes.

97

- Ten, then I'll bring the president.
- Confirm in 10.

98
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:51,912
If the event's over by 10,
I can be back here at 11.

99
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,956
- That means?
- You can watch girls' softball.

100
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:57,358
- Did you just snicker?
- No, sir.

101
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:01,715
You did. When you said,
"girls' softball," you snickered.

102
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:03,914
- No, sir.
- Yes. As if to say...

103
00:08:04,123 --> 00:08:08,480
...something was wrong in my
wanting to see a girls' softball game, live, via satalite.

104
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:11,880
- You seem excited.
- They're ready, Mr. President.

105
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,313
Thanks, Phil. I am excited about it.

106
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:19,881
At the end of a long day, you sit back, open a beer
and watch sporting event. that's what men do.

107
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,314
- They watch girls' softball?
- When it's what's on that's what they watch.

108
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:27,835
It's that or cricket.
I'm an educated man...

109
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:32,719
...but when someone explains cricket,
I want to hit them with a teapot!

110
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:34,072
- Morning.
- Morning.

111
00:08:34,283 --> 00:08:38,322
So, softball. Sacramento State
vs. University of the Pacific.

112
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:41,162
- A clash of titans.
- Don't spoil my fun.

113
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,797
I'll get to the end of the day, sit--

114
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:46,722
- And watch girls' softball.
- That's right.

115
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:49,232
- Morning, sir.
- Hey, Steve. Mikey.

116
00:08:49,443 --> 00:08:53,436
- Have I gotten any names right?
- No, but you came close.

117
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:55,520
- Morning.
- Morning, everyone!

118
00:08:55,723 --> 00:09:00,319
Let's get right to it. It's a
town hall meeting broadcast live.

119
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:04,402
For rehearsal, Carol will moderate.
She'll be to your right.

120
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:09,518
- You'll have water and a glass.
- I speak facing the audience, right?

121
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:13,432
How do I know? I've done it
2 to 300,000 times before.

122
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,918
- Why didn't <i>Columbia</i> land?
- Sir?

123
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,353
The shuttle didn't land.

124
00:09:18,563 --> 00:09:20,360
- I don't know.
- Ask Toby.

125
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:23,953
- Why would Toby know?
- His brother's on that flight.

126
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,677
- A payload specialist.
- I didn't know.

127
00:09:26,883 --> 00:09:29,875
He's up there with four
Japanese newts.

128
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:35,919
He wants to see how absence
of gravity affects their inner ears.

129
00:09:36,123 --> 00:09:38,591
- Know what he calls them?
- Astro-newts?

130
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:41,078
Exactly.
Ask him why it didn't land.

131
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:45,117
- Here we go!
- Mr. President, the first question--

132
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:50,078
Sorry. C.J., you say I have a pitcher
of water and a drinking glass.

133
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:53,593
And the water gets into the glass how?

134
00:09:55,163 --> 00:09:56,801
<i>It'll go like this:</i>

135
00:09:57,283 --> 00:10:00,673
"Your administration has pursued
a policy of what?"

136
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:05,195
"Constructive engagement
toward China, a Communist country...

137
00:10:05,403 --> 00:10:10,238
...that has imprisoned dissidents?
Oppressed its blah, blah, blah.

138
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,879
But your administration
has refused to engage Cuba.

139
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,756
- Why the double standard?"
- Interesting.

140
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:22,083
Thanks. We need an answer on Cuba
and we need an answer on farm loans.

141
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:25,355
- Students won't ask about Cuba.
- Faculty will.

142
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:29,033
I didn't know you had
a brother on the space shuttle.

143
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:33,600
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- I do.

144
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:36,078
Know why the shuttle didn't land?

145
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:39,798
Did you know the shuttle
was meant to land and didn't?

146
00:10:40,003 --> 00:10:42,312
Something going on on the shuttle?

147
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,081
- I'll find out.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:48,196
- And write me an answer on Cuba.
- Okay.

149
00:10:48,403 --> 00:10:51,520
Did you get me a meeting
with the vice president?

150
00:10:51,723 --> 00:10:53,634
- You won't be happy.
- Jogging!

151
00:10:53,843 --> 00:10:56,721
- Yes.
- We couldn't just sit in chairs?

152
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:59,312
It's the only time he could see you.

153
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:03,277
Order pasta. Nothing like a meeting
you gotta carb up for.

154
00:11:03,483 --> 00:11:06,441
- You should be at town hall prep.
- I'm going.

155
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:09,601
They started 10 minutes ago.

156
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,634
- Where's my chair?
- Let's go.

157
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,799
- Where's my chair?
- What chair?

158
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:16,995
- The chair I sit in.
- It's at the shop.

159
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:19,398
- Shop?
- You said a wheel wobbled.

160
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:22,242
You call maintenance
for a screwdriver.

161
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:25,355
- I sent it to the shop.
- We have one?

162
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:28,794
It's not so much a shop
as it is my friend Curtis.

163
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:32,359
- He's fixing my chair?
- I'm throwing him some work.

164
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:36,078
How much is he charging
the federal government?

165
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:40,276
- He said he'd have to look at the job.
- At his shop.

166
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:45,477
More than 40 million Americans lack
insurance, most of them children.

167
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:50,473
In the first year of your presidency,
you proposed no new solution.

168
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:55,154
Can we expect action, or will your
administration nibble at the edges?

169
00:11:55,363 --> 00:12:00,153
- I wouldn't say we've nibbled.
- Don't repeat. It'll be a sound bite.

170
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:03,753
If we don't have a solution, at least
we can acknowledge the problem.

171
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:09,720
I agree that too many Americans don't
have the health care they deserve.

172
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:14,155
It's intolerable that most are
children. We can and must do more.

173
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:17,036
- Sir?
- Hang on. Now can I blame Congress?

174
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,802
Knock yourself out.

175
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:22,678
Mr. President, I need you
in the Situation Room.

176
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:38,832
- Mr. President.
- Is the pilot alive?

177
00:12:39,043 --> 00:12:41,876
He had an ejector seat onboard.

178
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,155
Aegis systems on the <i>North Dakota...</i>

179
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:48,878
...picked up a tracking signal
in the Fao peninsula.

180
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,722
- The middle of nowhere.
- Who's out there?

181
00:12:51,923 --> 00:12:56,951
- The Iraqi R.G. will patrol the area.
- Somebody's within 10 miles of him.

182
00:12:57,163 --> 00:13:01,839
Our guy is 10 miles from the
Iraqi Republican Guard?

183
00:13:02,523 --> 00:13:06,516
- It's whoever gets there first.
- You got a rescue scenario?

184
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:10,352
The 16th Special Operations Group
out of Hurlburt Field.

185
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:13,873
- They use the Pave Hawks?
- And the MH-53J.

186
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:19,032
These specially-equipped helicopters
fly treetop altitude at 180 knots.

187
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,633
Can I suggest, rather than
a military rescue plan--?

188
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,038
- Please.
- A call to Ambassador--

189
00:13:25,243 --> 00:13:30,795
- You want to check with the embassy?
- Three hours on diplomatic solutions--

190
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,916
How about I drop you and your
American warplane...

191
00:13:35,123 --> 00:13:38,115
...in the middle of a desert?

192
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:44,751
Then tell me if we have time to find a
diplomatic solution before we get you.

193
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:47,961
- What's his name?
- I'm sorry, sir?

194
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:52,122
- The pilot. What's his name?
- Captain Scott Hotchkiss.

195
00:13:52,323 --> 00:13:54,359
- Where's he from?
- Rhode Island.

196
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:57,873
- How old is he?
- Twenty-six.

197
00:14:01,563 --> 00:14:04,680
Rob told me last week
the Iraqi government...

198
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:09,832
...has put out a bounty,
the equivalent of $14,000...

199
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:15,117
...for any American plane shot down
or any American soldier captured.

200
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:18,840
- He was patrolling the no-fly zone?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:14:19,043 --> 00:14:21,034
- He had not engaged.
- No, sir.

202
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:25,915
Phil, if it ends up Fitzwallace
has to call this kid's parents...

203
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:29,035
...I swear to God,
I'm invading Baghdad.

204
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,955
- Get him back.
- Yes, sir.

205
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:52,952
- Yeah?
- Oh, C.J.

206
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:56,678
Iraqis shot down a Nighthawk
in the no-fly zone.

207
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,521
- Is the pilot alive?
- Yes.

208
00:14:58,723 --> 00:15:01,795
He's caught between
Republican Guard divisions.

209
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:07,722
- Pentagon team's coming to brief you.
- Is there a rescue mission?

210
00:15:07,923 --> 00:15:10,357
The president gave the order
an hour ago.

211
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:14,397
If Iraq shot down an F-117,
they'll want to tell the world.

212
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:19,518
The press will have the news before
you've finished whatever you're doing.

213
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:26,071
A problem when conducting a covert
mission in the age of instant news.

214
00:15:26,283 --> 00:15:28,877
- Understand what I'm telling you?
- Yes.

215
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:33,554
Because there was a problem
a few months ago with India-Pakistan.

216
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:36,516
You were uncomfortable
lying to the press.

217
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:42,355
I wasn't lying to them. You lied to
me, which made me look like an idiot.

218
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:46,281
Well, I'm not lying to you now.

219
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:51,242
Four MH-53J Pave Lows with guys
from the 16th Special Ops...

220
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,434
...are out flying under radar.

221
00:15:53,643 --> 00:15:56,396
We'll pay a price
for misleading the press.

222
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:58,992
- I don't care.
- I understand.

223
00:15:59,203 --> 00:16:04,800
- An F-117?
- You should go to your briefing.

224
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:08,191
- An F-117's a Stealth Fighter?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:11,361
We'll be talking about
how they shot one down?

226
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,794
- That's for sure.
- I set a meeting with Hoynes.

227
00:16:15,003 --> 00:16:17,471
- When?
- In an hour. We're jogging.

228
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:23,197
Listen. Don't tell him why it's bad
for us. Tell him why it's bad for him.

229
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,835
- Don't worry about the meeting.
- See me after.

230
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:29,241
- An F-117?
- Yeah.

231
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,081
- A Stealth Fighter?
- Yes.

232
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,673
- How was it seen?
- I'm sure they're looking into it.

233
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:38,512
In its defense, it is a generation
behind the B2 Spirit.

234
00:16:38,723 --> 00:16:43,558
A Stealth Fighter should be stealthy,
or we should call it something else.

235
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:45,958
- Hello.
- Hi.

236
00:16:46,163 --> 00:16:49,200
One of the payload bay doors
would not close.

237
00:16:49,403 --> 00:16:52,918
- I'm sorry?
- Specifically, the starboard door.

238
00:16:53,123 --> 00:16:58,800
- If your ass isn't off my desk, stat--
- This is his fourth shuttle mission.

239
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:03,042
Dr. David Ziegler holds degrees
in physiology and biology.

240
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:07,794
- I know more about him than about you.
- A door wouldn't close?

241
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:10,961
The mission commander at NASA,
Peter Jobson...

242
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:14,360
...said a power unit jammed.
They need to fix it.

243
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:18,920
- They didn't wanna land till morning.
- It's morning on the shuttle.

244
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:21,318
- At Edwards.
- It's morning now.

245
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,957
EVA's taking them a little time.

246
00:17:24,363 --> 00:17:28,151
Well, it's a red-letter day
for U.S. aviation, isn't it?

247
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:31,116
Jobson was calm.
Said it's a minor problem.

248
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:33,757
C.J. will need the briefing room.

249
00:17:33,963 --> 00:17:36,875
Let's move prep
when the president's free.

250
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,551
We're working out an answer on Cuba.

251
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:42,721
- Also on teachers.
- Okay. Sam?

252
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:48,043
Keep in touch with Peter Jobson.
Let me know when it lands, would you?

253
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,274
Yeah.

254
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:51,598
- Toby?
- Yeah?

255
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,681
- CNN's got the Nighthawk.
- Thank you.

256
00:17:56,403 --> 00:18:00,282
The S & L industry was deregulated
by a Democratic Congress...

257
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:04,635
...flooded with S & L donations,
a banking industry disaster...

258
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:06,561
...that cost $500 billion.

259
00:18:06,763 --> 00:18:09,357
- The point?
- We're no better with money.

260
00:18:09,563 --> 00:18:11,918
Most Democratic Party soft money...

261
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,876
...is from corporations,
not labor unions.

262
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:20,874
Over 100 businesses gave both parties
more than $125,000 last election.

263
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,721
Gave it to both parties!

264
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:27,075
That isn't free speech, or political
values, Mr. Vice President.

265
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:30,241
I don't know how,
but we've legalized bribery.

266
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:34,482
We've got two corporate parties,
one pro-life, one pro-choice.

267
00:18:34,683 --> 00:18:38,835
When I said, "What's your point?"
I meant, "What's your point?"

268
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:43,195
We've noticed an increase
in racquetball and poker games...

269
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:47,282
...with Democratic opponents
of campaign finance reform.

270
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:51,522
There are many Democrats against
finance reform in Washington.

271
00:18:51,723 --> 00:18:54,874
- Can we stop running a second?
- Yeah.

272
00:18:56,603 --> 00:19:00,642
You're backing the wrong horse.
You read the same polls I do.

273
00:19:00,843 --> 00:19:04,233
The president's gone up
nine points in three weeks.

274
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,593
Fifty-one percent job approval.

275
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:09,363
On TV tonight,
he'll pick up five more.

276
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:14,512
That's 56 percent and a 14-point bump
in a month. That's daunting-- Hang on.

277
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:18,313
If we bring this pilot back alive,
that's 10 points.

278
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,593
And we have a rating in the 60s.

279
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:25,558
Now Democratic congressmen are paying
to be seen with the president.

280
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:30,958
You're looking around the racquetball
court saying, "Where'd everyone go?"

281
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:36,601
You've had experience battling Bartlet
when he's right and when he's popular.

282
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:40,512
Why would you try it
when he's both at the same time?

283
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,362
You know something, Josh?
I wonder...

284
00:19:43,563 --> 00:19:49,433
...if I'd listened to you two years
ago, would I be president right now?

285
00:19:49,643 --> 00:19:51,952
You ever wonder that?

286
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:58,682
No, sir. I know it for sure.

287
00:20:02,843 --> 00:20:06,518
I'm done.
Thank you for your time, sir.

288
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:29,754
Good afternoon. A U.S. Air Force F-117
Nighthawk Stealth Fighter aircraft...

289
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:34,479
...flying a routine patrol from
Al Jabar Air Force Base in Kuwait...

290
00:20:34,683 --> 00:20:38,232
...was shot down over
the southern no-fly zone in Iraq.

291
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:41,082
We don't know
the condition of the pilot.

292
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:46,232
We know the plane's ACES Il
zero/zero ejector seat was activated.

293
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:50,675
General Richmond and General Clancy
will talk more about that.

294
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,794
- Danny.
- Is a rescue underway?

295
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,518
Scenarios are being contemplated.
I won't speculate.

296
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:00,602
We've spoken with the Iraqis,
seeking a diplomatic solution.

297
00:21:00,803 --> 00:21:03,920
- There have been no military moves?
- No.

298
00:21:04,123 --> 00:21:06,318
- Chris.
- Walk us through....

299
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:13,722
To tag Congress as obstructionist,
you have to list your accomplishments.

300
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:19,395
Expanding coverage for poor children.
Making health care portable.

301
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:21,514
Also list this year's agenda.

302
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:24,283
- You know what's hard, C.J.?
- Sir?

303
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,840
I'm rehearsing without the pitcher
and the glass, and it's weird.

304
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:32,956
- What if he takes his jacket off?
- No. It'll look staged.

305
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:37,042
- Not if he does it right.
- What, throw it over his shoulder?

306
00:21:37,243 --> 00:21:38,392
Maybe.

307
00:21:38,603 --> 00:21:41,276
- Can we get him wired?
- No.

308
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,758
With the mike, stool and jacket...

309
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:48,195
...I can do the meeting
and then a couple of sets at the Copa.

310
00:21:48,403 --> 00:21:51,042
- Hey.
- My musical director, Zoey Bartlet.

311
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:54,076
- Working?
- Deciding if I take my jacket off.

312
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:57,002
- Know what I think?
- I couldn't care less.

313
00:21:57,203 --> 00:22:00,718
- Come with us tonight.
- I was-- Dad, are you sweating?

314
00:22:00,923 --> 00:22:02,515
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

315
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,395
You took your pills?
Fine. Go ahead, collapse.

316
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:09,834
Are you channeling Mom?
Come to Virginia tonight.

317
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:13,080
- I can watch on TV.
- It's not like being there.

318
00:22:13,283 --> 00:22:16,719
You'll talk about me
and my face will turn red.

319
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:21,360
- It's just gonna be awful.
- Bonus. Then it's settled.

320
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:24,396
Charlie wanted
to say something during prep.

321
00:22:24,603 --> 00:22:26,798
- I'm going to see Mom.
- You'll come?

322
00:22:27,003 --> 00:22:28,595
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

323
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:35,243
All right, everyone, we're done.
Thanks.

324
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:37,673
Thank you, Mr. President.

325
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:41,000
- You wanted to mention something?
- I'm sorry?

326
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,273
- Something to mention.
- No, sir.

327
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:45,394
- You sure?
- Yes, sir.

328
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:48,436
There was just
a misunderstanding.

329
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:53,637
I was thinking it might not be a bad
idea to have a signal worked out.

330
00:22:53,843 --> 00:22:54,878
For what?

331
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:58,393
Good news about the pilot
if it comes while you're on TV.

332
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:03,119
- What kind of signal?
- Something like this:

333
00:23:05,563 --> 00:23:10,842
- Just very subtle, very simple.
- What is that?

334
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:14,357
It's departure.
It's a safe departure.

335
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,123
- Want a different one?
- That one's good.

336
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:20,759
- Should I spread it around?
- It'll get around by itself.

337
00:23:20,963 --> 00:23:23,238
But if you want to help, that's okay.

338
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,638
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,915
Hey, Josh.

340
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:35,240
- What's going on?
- I just talked to Hoynes.

341
00:23:35,443 --> 00:23:38,515
- Is he in?
- He's onboard. You did a good job.

342
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:40,202
Good.

343
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,678
Josh. Did you happen to say...

344
00:23:42,883 --> 00:23:48,082
...that if Scott Hotchkiss comes back
alive, there'll be a 10-point bump?

345
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,035
I did.

346
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:55,158
I gotta tell you, if the president
heard that, he'd be out of his skin.

347
00:23:55,363 --> 00:23:59,914
Don't do that, even in private.
The guy's been blown out of the sky.

348
00:24:00,123 --> 00:24:04,401
He could be injured. For sure,
he's in a desert with no water.

349
00:24:04,603 --> 00:24:07,993
We're not the only ones
looking for him.

350
00:24:08,203 --> 00:24:13,357
If they get him, and all he gives them
is name, rank and serial number...

351
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:16,919
...they'll beat him.
They're gonna torture him.

352
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:23,119
Not to mention 80 guys who'll get shot
at if they're picked up below radar.

353
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:25,275
You're right.

354
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:31,558
The president's joked around, but
he's living and dying with each hour.

355
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:35,517
He'd be offended to know you
discussed a political upside.

356
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:40,160
As a guy who flew planes in the war,
I was offended too.

357
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,200
Yes, sir.

358
00:24:42,483 --> 00:24:44,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

359
00:24:44,923 --> 00:24:47,437
You did good.
But you can be a person.

360
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:51,472
- I apologize.
- Your apology's accepted.

361
00:24:51,843 --> 00:24:53,595
What are you doing?

362
00:24:55,003 --> 00:25:00,077
- It looked like you wanted to hug me.
- Man, did you read that wrong.

363
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:04,560
Okay.

364
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:09,073
Sam was here before.
We've got some kind of signal?

365
00:25:09,283 --> 00:25:12,241
For if we know something
during the town hall.

366
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:16,356
- It'll be days. What's the signal?
- It's this here:

367
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:18,355
- What's that?
- The signal.

368
00:25:18,563 --> 00:25:22,238
- Looks like a hip-hop gesture.
- It's a plane taking off.

369
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:26,675
- Doesn't look like a plane taking off.
- This is bad, this is good:

370
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,792
- I got it.
- You don't have to be a cryptographer.

371
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:36,917
I really do apologize.

372
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,560
Thank you.

373
00:25:44,763 --> 00:25:48,153
- Zoey, can I talk to you in here?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:51,560
- I wish you hadn't done that.
- You chickened out.

375
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,674
I didn't. It's inappropriate.

376
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:57,922
I don't have the same relationship
with your father that you have.

377
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,274
It's not out of line
to put your two cents in.

378
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:03,201
- We're using your office--

379
00:26:03,403 --> 00:26:06,361
Keep fighting.
I just need to find something.

380
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:10,556
I wasn't out of line to stick up
for you. You were chicken.

381
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:14,676
I work in a building with
the smartest people in the world.

382
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,274
Donna!

383
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:22,401
- Hi.
- How you doing?

384
00:26:22,603 --> 00:26:26,232
We should get something temporary,
so that won't happen.

385
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:30,482
- I wish you wouldn't do that anymore.
- Okay, but you're wrong.

386
00:26:30,683 --> 00:26:32,594
I'll see you later.

387
00:26:37,323 --> 00:26:40,633
Come in.
What do you know?

388
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:42,322
- Listen--
- Sam?

389
00:26:42,723 --> 00:26:46,716
No, it's not-- Cathy's getting
Peter Jobson on the phone.

390
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:49,198
- He'll tell you about this.
- Sam?

391
00:26:49,763 --> 00:26:52,721
There was a screwup
when they closed the door.

392
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:57,280
They did a manual winch op,
disconnecting the motor from the door.

393
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:03,319
As a result of that or something else,
the two OMS engines are failing.

394
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:06,595
OMS is
the Orbital Maneuvering Systems.

395
00:27:09,843 --> 00:27:14,837
- Do you know if they have primary RCS?
- That's what they're trying now.

396
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:19,718
If it were at a certain level,
they'd call the president.

397
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:23,074
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

398
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:28,438
Anyway, Cathy's getting Peter Jobson.

399
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:32,397
Before, when you first asked me...

400
00:27:32,603 --> 00:27:35,481
...the reason I reacted
the way I did....

401
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:40,279
I was just embarrassed,
'cause honestly...

402
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:44,917
...I forgot he was up there.

403
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:51,874
They switched his mission order around
a few times, and I lost track.

404
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,643
Toby, Peter Jobson's on 05.

405
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,082
Thank you.

406
00:28:14,963 --> 00:28:18,592
Admiral Fitzwallace phoned.
He's on his way over.

407
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:21,363
- Would you like anything?
- No, thanks.

408
00:28:21,563 --> 00:28:24,077
What was Zoey talking about before?

409
00:28:24,283 --> 00:28:26,956
- It was nothing, sir.
- What was it?

410
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:31,953
There's a report that's been
sitting on your desk for a few weeks.

411
00:28:32,163 --> 00:28:35,838
- It has?
- My desk, really. So I was reading it.

412
00:28:36,043 --> 00:28:39,035
In prep, you've been
having discussions...

413
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:41,962
...about youth participation
in politics.

414
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:43,312
What's the report?

415
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,920
It's from the Center
for Policy Alternatives.

416
00:28:47,123 --> 00:28:50,559
Some things in it hit home.
I mentioned it to Zoey.

417
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:54,039
- Mr. President, Chairman Fitzwallace.
- Thank you.

418
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,438
Charlie, put it in my briefcase.

419
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:57,792
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks.

420
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,279
- Charlie. Mr. President.
- Do you have any news?

421
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:03,713
I think I will in just a minute.

422
00:29:03,923 --> 00:29:09,953
They'll put the call through here.
Mind if I wait with you, sir?

423
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:16,441
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

424
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:19,362
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I feel fine.

425
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,318
The eagle on the seal
in the carpet....

426
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:31,357
He holds arrows in one talon.
An olive branch in the other.

427
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:34,676
Mostly, the eagle faces
the olive branch.

428
00:29:34,883 --> 00:29:39,718
But when Congress declares war,
the eagle faces the arrows.

429
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:41,879
How do they do that?

430
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:47,111
Do you think they've got a second
carpet sitting around in the basement?

431
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,802
I don't know.

432
00:29:49,003 --> 00:29:52,518
Maybe this piece in the middle
cuts out.

433
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:55,118
- I honestly don't know.
- Chairman?

434
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,883
- Your call. The blinking light.
- Thanks.

435
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,916
I'll stop bugging you
in just a minute.

436
00:30:01,123 --> 00:30:02,841
Yeah?

437
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,200
Thanks.

438
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:08,920
I have Captain Scott Hotchkiss
on the phone.

439
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:13,560
He's cleared Iraqi airspace
and he's on his way to Tel Aviv.

440
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,754
Fitz.

441
00:30:17,123 --> 00:30:19,683
- Congratulations, sir.
- The kid's okay?

442
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,760
He's got a sprained ankle.

443
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:26,036
Well, that's a job
awfully well done, Mr. Chairman.

444
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:27,915
- Thank you.
- I owe you.

445
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:29,795
That's not how it works.

446
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:32,801
I'll check out that thing
with the carpet.

447
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:37,440
- Talk to the pilot.
- Seriously, I'll get you an answer.

448
00:30:38,163 --> 00:30:43,317
Captain Hotchkiss, this is President
Bartlet. How's your ankle?

449
00:30:43,523 --> 00:30:47,675
Good. Before you say more,
give me your parents' phone number.

450
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:49,874
I never get to make this call.

451
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:53,240
<i>Radar officers monitored Hotchkiss...</i>

452
00:30:53,443 --> 00:30:57,436
<i>...as his plane went "feet dry"</i>
<i>south of the 33rd parallel.</i>

453
00:30:57,643 --> 00:30:58,632
- C.J.
- Katie.

454
00:30:58,843 --> 00:31:02,472
Did we use Saudi Arabian airspace?
With permission?

455
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:07,074
We flew secretly on the way in.
They were told on the way out.

456
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:10,161
- Is that when the British were told?
- Yes.

457
00:31:10,363 --> 00:31:14,117
Folks, it's after 7.
Most of us have to get to Arlington.

458
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:17,679
This will all be covered
at the Pentagon briefing...

459
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:22,559
...which will begin 30 minutes
after our return. That's all for now.

460
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:24,640
Excuse me.

461
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,121
- Nice!
- Congratulations.

462
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:31,395
Thought I'd see
"Saudi Arabia" spelled with a Y.

463
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,071
I can spell better than you think.

464
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,877
- One L in "Tel Aviv."
- Okay.

465
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:39,313
In the office.

466
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:46,919
I did the right thing. Your nose
is out of joint, and I don't care.

467
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:50,593
You told me you were working
on a diplomatic--

468
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:56,116
Did you think I was gonna fork over
the frequency we're transmitting on?

469
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:59,992
You could have said,
"We're not ruling anything out.

470
00:32:00,203 --> 00:32:02,842
I won't let you
take me down that path."

471
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:08,117
If I misdirected the Iraqis half
a beat, it was absolutely worth it.

472
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:14,114
That's a no-brainer. Only 50 people
can't understand why I lied.

473
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,474
They all work in the White House
press room.

474
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:21,722
You didn't have to call on me.
Everyone was gonna ask that.

475
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:26,155
You knew what your answer
was gonna be. You called on me.

476
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,512
Yes, I did.

477
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:31,159
You wouldn't do that
to a less supportive journalist?

478
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:34,639
- I chose you.
- I'm not staying in the penalty box.

479
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:37,437
I've covered the White House
for years.

480
00:32:37,643 --> 00:32:41,522
With <i>The Washington Post, Time,</i>
and <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>!

481
00:32:41,723 --> 00:32:44,715
You can't mess me around like this!

482
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:48,757
I gotta say, that was a turn-on.
Though I don't know why...

483
00:32:48,963 --> 00:32:52,319
...you were most haughty
on <i>The Dallas Morning News.</i>

484
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,753
The buses are leaving.

485
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:58,158
The buses are leaving.

486
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:03,159
- Girls' softball?
- Women's. It'll be great.

487
00:33:03,363 --> 00:33:06,082
I'm watching a live sports
event tonight.

488
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:09,878
And when those teams get together,
it's a barnburner.

489
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:12,358
You won't spoil my good time.

490
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:16,351
Sir, I think we both know
from experience that's not true.

491
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,075
You need to be in the car.

492
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:23,242
- See me walking out?
- You're arguing with a senior citizen.

493
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:24,558
I'm leaving.

494
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:29,518
Sam has notes on Cuba and farm loans
I want you to look over in the car.

495
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:34,160
All right, I'll be at the car
in just a second. Thank you.

496
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,394
Toby?

497
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:44,594
Toby?

498
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:49,280
- Excuse me, Mr. President.
- You can't see them.

499
00:33:49,483 --> 00:33:54,238
They're over Australia now.
I just spoke to the mission commander.

500
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:57,556
They're trying firing an RCS.

501
00:33:57,763 --> 00:34:02,234
The Reaction Control System.
It's actually 40 separate engines.

502
00:34:02,443 --> 00:34:05,753
If it doesn't work,
there's 39 other things to try.

503
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,791
There's redundancy after redundancy
built in.

504
00:34:10,003 --> 00:34:13,996
For good measure, <i>Atlantis</i>
is warming up on the launch pad.

505
00:34:14,203 --> 00:34:19,038
It could dock with the <i>Columbia</i>
in two hours. We can do that now.

506
00:34:21,483 --> 00:34:25,795
The shuttle opens cargo bay doors
after leaving the atmosphere.

507
00:34:26,003 --> 00:34:27,482
That lets the heat out.

508
00:34:27,683 --> 00:34:30,880
Once the doors close,
they have a short window...

509
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,996
...to get back before it overheats.

510
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:39,477
- They'll open those doors again.
- How?

511
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:43,915
Same way they closed them.
With a five-dollar wrench.

512
00:34:44,403 --> 00:34:48,840
When we're done tonight, you should
fly to Edwards Air Force Base...

513
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:53,833
...meet it when it lands, stop being
an ass and talk to your brother.

514
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:57,159
Mr. President?

515
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:05,760
I appreciate your trying to be a
comfort, and that you have...

516
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:10,241
...some understanding
of the situation with my brother...

517
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:13,916
...but it was supposed to land
19 hours ago.

518
00:35:14,123 --> 00:35:17,513
Obviously there's a problem.

519
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:21,716
It's space travel, and I don't believe
any problem is minor.

520
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:26,560
The shuttle flies itself, Toby.

521
00:35:27,163 --> 00:35:29,757
No, it doesn't, Mr. President.

522
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:36,842
No. It doesn't.

523
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:59,840
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>That was a joke about politicians.</i>

524
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:02,477
Two politicians are arguing.

525
00:36:02,683 --> 00:36:07,962
One shouts, "You're lying!" The other
says, "Yes, but hear me out."

526
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:13,112
- We have time for one more question.
- I didn't answer the last one yet.

527
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:16,554
We're moments away.
I'm gonna get the door.

528
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:21,600
A man once said this: "Decisions
are made by those who show up."

529
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:25,273
Are we failing you, or are you
failing us? A little of both.

530
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,998
A guy named Charlie Young
showed me a report...

531
00:36:29,203 --> 00:36:34,152
...that said 61 percent of you agree
with the statement:

532
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:37,196
"Politicians have
failed my generation."

533
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:40,759
<i>When asked how older generations</i>
<i>see you--</i>

534
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:43,921
- What source?
- Center for Policy Alternatives.

535
00:36:44,123 --> 00:36:45,761
C.J. will have copies.

536
00:36:45,963 --> 00:36:48,033
<i>"--determined and independent."</i>

537
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:52,118
If I take my jacket off,
will you read nothing into it...

538
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:56,953
...other than I've been talking for
two hours under these hot lights?

539
00:37:04,683 --> 00:37:06,913
- Follow me.
- What?

540
00:37:09,003 --> 00:37:10,322
- Where's Toby?
- Why?

541
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:12,161
- He's got a call.
- From?

542
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,638
- Peter Jobson.
- Give it to me.

543
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:19,199
Toby.

544
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,235
Josh.

545
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:41,436
- Gina! Straight to the car.
- He's not working the rope line?

546
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:43,759
He wants to watch softball.

547
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:46,318
- They show softball on TV?
- Yeah.

548
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:49,321
And the president watches it?

549
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:58,712
They tell me we're out of time.

550
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:04,998
I want to say that this evening I was
called both a liberal and a populist.

551
00:38:05,203 --> 00:38:10,277
A man in the back called me a socialist.
I hadn't heard that for a while.

552
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,041
<i>Actually, I'm an economics professor.</i>

553
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:20,352
My ancestor, Dr. Josiah Bartlet
was the New Hampshire delegate...

554
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:25,762
...to the second Continental Congress.
The one that sat in session in 1776...

555
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:30,673
...and announced that we were no
longer subjects of King George Ill...

556
00:38:30,883 --> 00:38:33,602
...but rather a self-governing people.

557
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:37,000
"We hold these truths self-evident,"
they said.

558
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,478
"That all men are created equal."

559
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:44,234
Strange, but it was the first time
anyone wrote it down.

560
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:48,676
Decisions are made
by those who show up.

561
00:38:48,883 --> 00:38:53,593
Class dismissed. Thank you.
God bless you, and God bless America!

562
00:38:55,403 --> 00:38:57,155
Here we go.

563
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:26,678
He's not working the rope line, Mike.
Straight to the car.

564
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:29,113
I've got Bookbag.

565
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:35,041
He used it.
You're looking to thank me.

566
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,803
You had nothing to do with it.

567
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:42,758
- I accept your apology.
- Toby, walk with me.

568
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,194
- What do you got to say for yourself?
- About what?

569
00:40:04,203 --> 00:40:08,116
Baby pictures he's
heckling me with, Visa card bills.

570
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:12,475
He's walking the rope line.
Ever a chance he'd walk past a crowd?

571
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:14,162
Charlie!

572
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:17,719
I saw something.

573
00:40:17,923 --> 00:40:21,472
By the way, Charlie apologized to me.

574
00:40:21,683 --> 00:40:22,752
I saw something.

575
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:41,242
Gun!

576
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,842
Get down!

577
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,435
Stay down!

578
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:07,436
<i>We got people down! We need help</i>
<i>down here! Keep them down!</i>

579
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:09,998
<i>Who's been hit?  Who's been hit?</i>

580
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:47,592
