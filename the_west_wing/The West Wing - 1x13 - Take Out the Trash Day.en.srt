1
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:08,993
<i>- Previously:</i>
- Where'd you get that?

2
00:00:09,203 --> 00:00:13,993
It says Leo McGarry spent 28 days
in a substance abuse facility.

3
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:15,676
This was obtained illegally.

4
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:18,556
Records of these facilities
are confidential.

5
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,042
He's got them.

6
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,841
I thought I'd kiss you.

7
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:26,878
Then I'd be able to give my work
the kind of concentration it deserves.

8
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:32,276
I voluntarily admitted myself to
the Tucson Rehabilitation Facility...

9
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:35,441
...to treat an addiction
to alcohol and Valium.

10
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:43,039
Weather permitting, we'll be outside.

11
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,040
- Meaning?
- No rain.

12
00:00:45,243 --> 00:00:47,438
- C.J.
- It's gonna be 22 degrees.

13
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,076
- I know.
- Why do you--?

14
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:52,792
This president is from New England.
Get used to that.

15
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:56,632
That's what he said this morning.
What else do we have?

16
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:59,880
The president will sign the bill
with 15 pens.

17
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:02,159
Someone wanted you to know that.

18
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,513
- C.J.
- No questions about the pens.

19
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,520
I have a question about the pens.

20
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:10,073
"Josiah Bartlet" has 13 letters.
How will he use 15 pens?

21
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:15,403
Danny, you are the only one
in the room doing the math on that.

22
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:18,680
My readers expect a little bit more.

23
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:23,201
15 pens, 13 letters. They must
have stuck something in about--

24
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,877
Yes. He's gonna-- Interesting.

25
00:01:26,043 --> 00:01:29,831
He's gonna literally dot
the I and cross the T's.

26
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:32,113
- Thank you.
- Freak boy.

27
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:33,517
Thanks.

28
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:37,517
The parents of Lowell Lydell
have been added to the guest list.

29
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,272
- Also added to the guest list are--
- That's still on?

30
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,081
- What is?
- The Lydells.

31
00:01:43,243 --> 00:01:46,121
I've heard they don't
like the president and--

32
00:01:46,283 --> 00:01:49,275
I've heard that too.
It's ridiculous.

33
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:51,951
He's signing hate crimes legislation.

34
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:54,961
The Lydells' son was killed
for being gay.

35
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:57,000
- Just asking.
- I heard it too.

36
00:01:57,203 --> 00:02:01,401
- The Lydells are coming.
- They'll be available to the press?

37
00:02:01,603 --> 00:02:02,797
Where was I?

38
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:07,076
Senators Breech and Larkin
will be attending as well.

39
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:12,641
You've been a great audience.
Don't forget to tip your waitresses.

40
00:02:16,323 --> 00:02:19,759
- Shouldn't guarantee the Lydells.
- They're not coming?

41
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:23,121
They are coming,
I'm not sure we want them.

42
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:27,276
- I flew out to St. Paul.
- I spoke to the mother on the phone.

43
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:29,195
- She's fine.
- The father?

44
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:31,797
He doesn't say much.
It indicates--

45
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:35,558
His son was killed.
Want him to wear a campaign button?

46
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:39,033
I do, at the signing.
The reticence he exhibited--

47
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:43,162
- Listen to yourself.
- Meet them, tell me what you think.

48
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:49,040
- You want me to audition the Lydells?
- And to cut me some slack.

49
00:02:49,723 --> 00:02:52,601
Dotting the I's, crossing the T's.
Thank you.

50
00:02:52,763 --> 00:02:56,039
- We do our homework.
- You misspelled "senator."

51
00:02:57,843 --> 00:03:01,392
- We've got a sticky wicket.
- Don't say I'm working late.

52
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:04,794
- I need you to read a report.
- I'm in my prime.

53
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:07,761
No doubt, but I need you to read this.

54
00:03:07,963 --> 00:03:11,160
We want Congress to okay funds
for 100,000 new teachers.

55
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:14,838
They say we gotta stipulate
that in sex ed--

56
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,402
- Abstinence only?
- Yes.

57
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,680
I'd have no trouble
passing such a class.

58
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:25,554
We commissioned a report on sex ed
in public schools, and this is it.

59
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,918
- What's it say?
- It's not good.

60
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,761
How's it not good?

61
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:32,921
It says teaching abstinence only
doesn't work.

62
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,632
People will have sex
even if they're told not to.

63
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:39,601
- What do they recommend?
- Abstinence Plus.

64
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,277
Abstinence Plus?
What's that mean?

65
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:47,471
- Sam's renamed it "Everything But."
- "Everything But"?

66
00:03:47,683 --> 00:03:50,436
- They want teachers to teach--
- Yes.

67
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:52,201
The "sticky wicket" was--

68
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:55,395
A regrettable pun.
Should I order you food?

69
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:59,357
I can't remember the last time
I got home before midnight.

70
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:04,517
By the way, pages 27 to 33? A couple
things every girl should know.

71
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,358
Get me a salad.

72
00:04:55,323 --> 00:04:57,439
- Want to have dinner?
- With you?

73
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,514
I'm reading about sex ed.

74
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,914
I'm anticipating your joke
and not finding it funny.

75
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,962
You'll have to date me.
You can't just grab me and kiss me.

76
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:10,320
- You can, I won't mind.
- I didn't. You grabbed me.

77
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:13,281
First time. Every other time,
you grabbed me.

78
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,877
Randomly grabbing and kissing me.

79
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:19,996
There's better things ahead,
as I'm sure you're about to read.

80
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,319
What do you want?

81
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:27,193
An advance man for the VP took a Navy
chopper to Pebble Beach for 18 holes.

82
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:30,395
- Are you kidding me? How do you know?
- A source.

83
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,236
- What kind of source?
- The anonymous kind.

84
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:35,633
- I'll find out.
- Do it promptly.

85
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:40,923
A pilot sat around on the taxpayers'
dime while your guy hit sand traps.

86
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:44,439
- Okay. Wait.
- See you.

87
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:54,843
Okay, you can go now.

88
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,639
No problem.

89
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:06,358
- Josh. Did they burn the hamburger?
- I said well-done.

90
00:06:06,523 --> 00:06:09,833
He likes it beyond well-done, burnt.
Food's here.

91
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,681
- Did they burn it?
- Yes.

92
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:15,717
- Did you check?
- I'm not checking your food.

93
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:18,477
No, no, I'll carry it.

94
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,032
I like where,
if you drop it, it breaks.

95
00:06:21,283 --> 00:06:23,638
What's "take out the trash day"?

96
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:27,836
Stories we don't like, we give
to the press in a lump on Friday.

97
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:31,035
Why do it in a lump?
Why not spread them out?

98
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:35,714
They've got X column inches to fill.
They'll fill them, no matter what.

99
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:38,556
Give them one story,
it's X column inches.

100
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:40,634
- Five stories--
- A fifth the size.

101
00:06:40,843 --> 00:06:43,915
- Why Friday?
- No one reads the paper on Saturday.

102
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:48,036
- You guys are real populists.
- Salad's for C.J.

103
00:06:56,323 --> 00:07:00,760
An Alabama town wants to abolish
all laws except the Ten Commandments.

104
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,875
- I saw it.
- They'll have a problem.

105
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:07,479
The Constitution separates
church and state.

106
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:10,157
- Good point. Two problems.
- I'm busy.

107
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:14,481
- The Commandments are hard to enforce.
- What is it?

108
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:19,962
I just got asked to comment on a story
that's running in <i>The Georgetown Hoya.</i>

109
00:07:20,123 --> 00:07:22,000
The student newspaper?

110
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:26,401
A professor is teaching what
the paper feels is racist stuff.

111
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:30,397
- Funding for Head Start, welfare--
- Why are they talking to us?

112
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,599
- Zoey's in the class.
- Who cares?

113
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:36,073
This minute, <i>The Georgetown Hoya.</i>
Tomorrow--

114
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:39,918
The president's daughter has
an idiot professor and...?

115
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:43,001
- I'll talk to Zoey.
- Please.

116
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,395
What else?

117
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,357
Coveting thy neighbor's wife.
How do you enforce that?

118
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,081
We never have our chats.

119
00:07:55,243 --> 00:07:57,518
- What chats?
- Our late-night chats.

120
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:59,793
Did we ever do that?

121
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,601
No.

122
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,993
Fellas. My office.

123
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,122
- Did you know that there's a town--?
- Yes.

124
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:11,719
- What do you think?
- Coveting is a problem.

125
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:16,638
If I were arrested for coveting,
I'd probably bear false witness.

126
00:08:18,763 --> 00:08:22,233
This sex ed report could not come
at a worse time.

127
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:25,680
100,000 teachers.
He's signing the Hate Crimes Bill.

128
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,117
He didn't write it.

129
00:08:27,323 --> 00:08:31,680
- I wish we'd known it was coming.
- That horse left the barn.

130
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:35,392
Deal with it tomorrow.
What's this thing on the Hill?

131
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:39,721
We're meeting with Bruno
from an Appropriations Subcommittee...

132
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:42,955
...with jurisdiction over
the White House budget.

133
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,432
- Is this about me?
- It's about me.

134
00:08:45,603 --> 00:08:50,199
I withheld information gained during
Inspector Javert's drug search.

135
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,473
- Can I say a word?
- No.

136
00:08:52,683 --> 00:08:56,562
- It was the right thing to do--
- I know. You're going too?

137
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:59,722
- Yeah.
- Okay.

138
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:03,239
- I'm sorry to make you guys--
- Leo, please!

139
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:09,274
- You don't know for sure.
- She just said she knew that for sure.

140
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:13,595
- She said she knew it in her heart.
- I know it for sure.

141
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,879
- She said it.
- Tell your boss.

142
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:17,795
- Excuse me.
- Good evening.

143
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:21,791
- What are you girls doing?
- We're just talking.

144
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:27,316
You work for very important people.
This is not a place for gossip.

145
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,916
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:36,562
She knew it in her heart.
I'm wrong about things in my heart.

147
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,635
Yeah, but she's right about this one.

148
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,835
Here's a group of federal employees.

149
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:46,480
Can I talk to you?
In Sam's office?

150
00:09:46,643 --> 00:09:49,680
- We'll need to ask Sam.
- I need Sam too.

151
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,795
- Sam.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:54,471
Donna needs to talk to us.
Looks bad.

153
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:57,322
This man with the golf clubs
and helicopter?

154
00:09:57,483 --> 00:10:01,078
- Chad Margrudian.
- Didn't he work for us?

155
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:02,676
- Kept screwing up.
- How?

156
00:10:02,843 --> 00:10:06,836
He advanced the Puerto Rico trip
and spent a day scuba diving.

157
00:10:07,043 --> 00:10:11,912
On the New York trip, he got tickets
to something the president didn't see.

158
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,234
- He's working for Hoynes?
- Played 18 holes at Pebble Beach.

159
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:19,402
- Which he's supposed to do.
- But not take a Navy helicopter.

160
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:23,312
- What does this have to do with us?
- We know who leaked the story.

161
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:35,636
You remember Chad Margrudian?
He took a ride--

162
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:38,841
- I already know. The golf?
- How do you know?

163
00:10:39,043 --> 00:10:41,034
Danny got it from a source.

164
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:43,114
- He gave it to you?
- Any problem?

165
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:48,755
- Was it the other way around? A joke.
- It better have been. What else?

166
00:10:48,963 --> 00:10:50,954
There's a thing with Zoey.

167
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:55,002
Her professor's teaching things.
We're getting her out of class.

168
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:59,799
You can dump them both out with
the trash. And I was kidding before.

169
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:03,599
I don't leak stories.
Don't believe me, ask Danny.

170
00:11:03,803 --> 00:11:07,034
- I do believe you.
- Good.

171
00:11:07,923 --> 00:11:11,711
- You okay by yourself?
- Why wouldn't I be okay?

172
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,759
Okay.

173
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:20,239
Good night.

174
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:37,793
Her name's Karen Larsen. She worked
in the vice president's office.

175
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:42,718
Aides thought she had a bit of a crush
on Hoynes, so they moved her away.

176
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:44,675
- Where?
- I'm glad you asked.

177
00:11:44,883 --> 00:11:48,512
Personnel?
How high's her FBI clearance?

178
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:51,283
- High enough.
- We found our man.

179
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:55,152
- Talk with her when you get back.
- Yeah.

180
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:58,196
The European Union favors
importing bananas...

181
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:02,436
...from Latin American countries
that used to be European colonies.

182
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:06,636
I don't want to talk about bananas.
Good morning.

183
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:09,755
Did you say you wanted a banana?
Get him a banana.

184
00:12:09,923 --> 00:12:11,276
- I don't want one.
- Sure?

185
00:12:11,443 --> 00:12:13,638
- Yes, thank you.
- It's got potassium.

186
00:12:13,843 --> 00:12:16,277
I'm done talking to you now.

187
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:20,522
Morning, everyone.
Sit down, please.

188
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:25,803
The point is, the rules discriminate
against poor Latin American countries.

189
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:28,158
- Are we a Latin American country?
- No.

190
00:12:28,323 --> 00:12:29,642
What's the point?

191
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:34,752
- American companies sell the bananas.
- I'm in trouble with Chiquita?

192
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:38,916
It's not you so much as--
Yeah, it's mostly you.

193
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:41,954
- Toby.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:45,559
We appointed people to the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

195
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,272
Republicans, as well as an
alarming number of Democrats...

196
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:52,594
- ...have held up those appointments.
- I've been briefed.

197
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:55,835
Their reluctance has little
to do with bananas.

198
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:59,080
- I'm meeting people this afternoon.
- You're set?

199
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:02,753
I was raised on <i>Sesame Street,</i>
and on <i>Julia Child.</i>

200
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:08,395
I was raised on <i>Brideshead Revisited.</i>
The legacies are safe in my hands.

201
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:14,121
- You've got a problem?
- You watched cooking shows?

202
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:18,433
- I watched Miss Julia Child.
- Okay.

203
00:13:18,643 --> 00:13:22,716
- C.J., Mandy mentioned the Lydells?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:22,883 --> 00:13:25,317
- You'll sit with them?
- This afternoon.

205
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:28,759
Talk to the father.
I'm concerned about the father.

206
00:13:28,963 --> 00:13:32,319
If you don't mind me asking,
what is your concern?

207
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,833
Mandy says he's withdrawn,
that he doesn't say much.

208
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:37,561
His son was just killed.

209
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:42,717
- He was killed because he was gay.
- And?

210
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:48,122
We can't put a guy front and center
who's ashamed that his son was gay.

211
00:13:48,643 --> 00:13:51,635
- Really?
- Fathers and sons, C.J.

212
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:57,082
He sells dental supplies in St. Paul.
How enlightened will he be?

213
00:13:57,243 --> 00:14:00,519
- Yeah, but his son just died.
- Sit and talk to them.

214
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:03,478
- Yes, sir.
- Is that it?

215
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:08,353
- Have you looked at the sex ed report?
- I haven't had a chance.

216
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:12,641
It's dramatic. We should discuss
the right forum to present it.

217
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:16,392
- I'll look it over and we'll talk.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:14:16,603 --> 00:14:19,913
Josh and Sam, wait up a second.
Leo, don't go away.

219
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,432
Excuse us a second.

220
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:29,680
- What time are you going to the Hill?
- Noon.

221
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:32,636
I want to preempt a hearing.
I don't want it.

222
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,954
I don't want it for Leo.
I don't want it for us.

223
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,552
They know that,
and they'll want a deal.

224
00:14:38,763 --> 00:14:42,915
Don't take anything off the table
until you've talked to me.

225
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,637
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

226
00:14:45,803 --> 00:14:49,591
I'll probably spend much of my day
talking about bananas.

227
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,082
- Godspeed.
- Thanks.

228
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:53,632
- Thanks, Mr. President.
- All right.

229
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:04,235
- Is Simon Blye meeting with you today?
- How did you know that?

230
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:09,039
I broke into your secret schedule
and took infrared photos.

231
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:14,036
Margaret told me.
Why are you meeting with that man?

232
00:15:14,323 --> 00:15:16,917
- He's a good friend.
- No, he's not.

233
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:22,439
- He's been a good friend to me.
- Which isn't hard when times are good.

234
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:28,400
The measure of a man is, how does he
behave when things are otherwise?

235
00:15:28,723 --> 00:15:30,156
I need counsel.

236
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,912
That you couldn't get from me?
Toby, Josh, Sam, C.J.?

237
00:15:34,123 --> 00:15:39,436
I didn't mean that, Mr. President.
Your counsel is valued above all else.

238
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:43,399
I just meant I can use
all the help I can get.

239
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:47,033
You put faith in people,
and I love you for that.

240
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:50,161
- I don't want you to be disappointed.
- Yes, sir.

241
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:53,998
- Especially now.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:56,361
Okay.

243
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,516
You've got to read the sex ed report.

244
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,156
- I will.
- Thanks, sir.

245
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:06,517
Thank you.

246
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,602
Tell me something.

247
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,601
- Are we off-the-record? Are we?
- Yes.

248
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:19,039
- Feels like we're on-the-record.
- We're off.

249
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:20,636
- Never mind.
- What?

250
00:16:20,843 --> 00:16:21,992
It was nothing.

251
00:16:22,163 --> 00:16:25,758
- I have no objection to the kissing.
- I understand.

252
00:16:25,923 --> 00:16:30,713
- Don't think that it's a problem.
- There won't be any more kissing.

253
00:16:30,883 --> 00:16:33,795
I'm sorry to hear that.

254
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,672
Can a father be embarrassed
about his son being gay...

255
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:42,994
...even after his son was murdered?

256
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:44,917
Yes.

257
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,722
To the extent that he wouldn't
support a law...

258
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:52,080
...that punishes perpetrators
of hate crimes...

259
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:57,715
...including the ones who tied his son
to a tree and threw rocks at him?

260
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,794
Yes.

261
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:04,600
- It eludes me.
- I know.

262
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,439
- What about the advance guy?
- I'll tell you Friday.

263
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:13,723
- Dumping it in the trash?
- He's a C-level aide. He's resigning.

264
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:17,199
- Minding the people's business.
- A job you're suited for.

265
00:17:17,363 --> 00:17:20,878
- Goodbye.
- Okay. See you.

266
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:25,160
Okay. You should go now.

267
00:17:25,763 --> 00:17:31,315
- I work here.
- Yes. Then I should go.

268
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,439
Okay.

269
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:43,113
This isn't a trial or deposition.
You won't be sworn in.

270
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:46,832
You're not on-the-record.
There will be no record.

271
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:52,031
I'm on the Appropriations Subcommittee
for White House budget and management.

272
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:55,682
Many of my colleagues want hearings...

273
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:59,358
...to determine any wrongdoing
by the White House...

274
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:03,880
...in covering up Leo McGarry's
problems with alcohol and drugs.

275
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,792
I want to see if we can avoid that,
as I'm sure you do.

276
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:11,878
- Yes, sir.
- So, what happened?

277
00:18:13,043 --> 00:18:14,522
- Leo?
- Is he here?

278
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:17,402
- Yes.
- Send him in.

279
00:18:19,243 --> 00:18:21,916
- Simon. Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

280
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,675
- Trouble getting here?
- No.

281
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:27,040
- How's Meredith?
- Spending all her time in the country.

282
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,197
You built the house, Simon.

283
00:18:31,923 --> 00:18:35,552
I know you're busy.
Why don't we talk about you?

284
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:36,712
Okay.

285
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:41,434
November 21, Congressman Lillienfield
announced in reckless fashion...

286
00:18:41,643 --> 00:18:44,441
...that the White House
staff is on drugs.

287
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:48,636
We were announcing our nominee
for the Supreme Court, so--

288
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:53,433
You didn't wanna blow the moment.
You can speak candidly here, Josh.

289
00:18:53,643 --> 00:18:55,759
Were you asked to investigate?

290
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:59,233
"Investigate" is a word
that gets us into trouble.

291
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:03,157
- You held interviews to determine...
- As a first glance.

292
00:19:03,363 --> 00:19:08,278
...if staffers used drugs, or if
anyone knew of staffers using drugs.

293
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:13,278
- Claypool subpoenaed the paperwork.
- Under the Freedom of Information Act.

294
00:19:13,483 --> 00:19:18,682
I've got your Claypool deposition.
I wanna talk about it for a moment.

295
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:20,071
Sure.

296
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,632
Josh and Sam.

297
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:26,762
They're up with Bruno's people,
trying to avoid a hearing.

298
00:19:26,963 --> 00:19:29,352
They won't be successful.

299
00:19:29,523 --> 00:19:32,799
Josh and Sam are good,
and Bruno's a reasonable guy.

300
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,592
There'll be a hearing.
It'll take months, it'll be awful.

301
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:41,678
We'll hear stories about booze
and pills and God knows what else.

302
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:45,961
The president has a budget to pass,
Mendoza to confirm...

303
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:49,274
...and he's gotta get a
Democratic Congress elected.

304
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:50,916
Leo....

305
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:56,400
Simon, did you come to tell me
I should resign?

306
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,355
Yeah.

307
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:04,240
I offered the president my
resignation. He won't accept it.

308
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:09,523
He's blinded by friendship and
he's being foolish. Point that out.

309
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:17,762
Simon, I'm just taking a guess.

310
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:21,472
Is there an op-ed piece coming out
I should know about?

311
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:22,962
In tomorrow's <i>Post.</i>

312
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:27,196
I wanted you to know since
we're friends. I have a copy.

313
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:29,923
I don't need it.
I know what it says.

314
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:33,075
For the good of the party
and the president...

315
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,912
...a leading Democrat
calls for my resignation.

316
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:42,635
Won't get much attention, and it won't
distract from the president's agenda.

317
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:47,679
I haven't seen you on the Sunday
morning talk shows in a while.

318
00:20:47,843 --> 00:20:52,837
- I'm glad I could help out.
- I hoped this would go differently.

319
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,882
Where's your concern for country,
party and president...

320
00:20:57,043 --> 00:21:01,161
...when you're out whoring
for Atlantic Oil?

321
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:06,712
- I'm insulted by that.
- I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

322
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,675
You should walk out now.

323
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:12,392
As a matter of fact,
I think you should run.

324
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,157
Oh, God.

325
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:29,192
- For how long?
- After the midterms.

326
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,597
- Almost a year.
- Yes.

327
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,197
You want us to wait for a year?

328
00:21:33,363 --> 00:21:35,593
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

329
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:38,038
I don't want the debate.
Nobody does.

330
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:41,115
Nobody wants to support it,
or to oppose it.

331
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:43,478
Nobody wants it before midterms.

332
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:46,316
If we put it in a drawer,
you guarantee--

333
00:21:46,523 --> 00:21:49,083
- No hearings.
- The president won't do it.

334
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:50,278
Yes, he will.

335
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:55,756
Leo hasn't done anything wrong.
The hearings won't turn up anything.

336
00:21:55,963 --> 00:22:01,356
- We aren't scared enough to hold back.
- Stop it. Honest to God.

337
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:05,198
It doesn't matter
what the hearing turns up.

338
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:10,033
This one is drugs, so it's sexy.
This is Geraldo's dream come true.

339
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:14,077
So don't get up with me, okay?
I am throwing you a rope.

340
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:18,319
Something you should remember
when you're on <i>Face the Nation.</i>

341
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:22,681
You can't get anything done
because Republicans are vindictive.

342
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:27,560
This is what happens.
Teens in the White House.

343
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:30,191
You screwed this up
from the beginning.

344
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:36,233
You should've been there on McGarry,
and run an internal investigation.

345
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:41,233
You come remarkably close to perjury
in the Claypool deposition.

346
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:46,272
I'd like to hold hearings
into the two of you being stupid.

347
00:22:48,003 --> 00:22:50,915
But I don't have that kind of time.

348
00:22:51,123 --> 00:22:54,877
Here's the phone.
I'm sure the president is waiting.

349
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:56,874
Excuse us.

350
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:14,076
Toby, your argument isn't with us.
We watch PBS. We like PBS.

351
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:17,235
But we work for congressmen
who have constituencies...

352
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:23,797
...that wonder why the government
subsidizes television for rich people.

353
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:26,079
It's not for rich people.

354
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:30,873
The public television audience
is a fairly accurate reflection...

355
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:34,160
...of the social and economic
makeup of the U.S.

356
00:23:34,323 --> 00:23:38,316
25% of the audience has incomes
lower than 20,000 a year.

357
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:42,840
Blacks comprise 11% of both public
and commercial television audience.

358
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:46,962
47% of PBS viewers have a
high-school education or less...

359
00:23:47,123 --> 00:23:51,753
...1% better than the commercial TV
audience. What are we talking about?

360
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:53,717
- Are they here?
- Yes.

361
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:55,714
- Get Mandy.
- Where is she?

362
00:23:55,923 --> 00:24:00,314
In the Oval Office having a
comfortable talk with the president.

363
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:06,081
"Most young people move from kissing
to intimate sexual behaviors...

364
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:07,756
...during their teens.

365
00:24:07,923 --> 00:24:10,756
More than 50% engage
in petting behavior."

366
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:13,477
- Is that what I think it is?
- Yes, sir.

367
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:18,315
"By the age of 14, more than 25%
have touched a girl's--"

368
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:20,519
I won't say that word.

369
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:25,596
- Not gonna say that.
- Okay.

370
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:28,359
Not gonna say that.

371
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:30,195
Excuse me, Mr. President.

372
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:32,319
The Lydells are in the Mural Room.

373
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:34,519
- Does C.J. know?
- She's waiting.

374
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:36,241
- Mr. President?
- Go.

375
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:38,519
Thank you, sir.

376
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,394
Would you like to share the report?

377
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:43,837
- With you?
- Yes, sir.

378
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:46,881
- No.
- May I ask why not, sir?

379
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:50,996
Because I'd rather not be in therapy
for the rest of my life.

380
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:53,040
Very well, sir.

381
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,923
I won't say that word.

382
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:04,882
Mr. and Mrs. Lydell?

383
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:09,082
I'm C.J. Cregg,
and you've already met Mandy.

384
00:25:09,243 --> 00:25:11,199
Yes, how do you do?

385
00:25:11,363 --> 00:25:14,321
Sit. Thank you for coming
such a long way...

386
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:17,759
...so soon after this
unspeakable tragedy.

387
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,032
Glad to be here.

388
00:25:19,203 --> 00:25:24,038
That's why we've asked to talk to you.
It was Mandy's impression...

389
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:27,400
...that you and your husband
have some reservations...

390
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:31,158
...about appearing
in support of the president.

391
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:36,718
I hate to have to put it so bluntly,
but is that true?

392
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:40,199
We strongly support
the Hate Crimes Law he's signing.

393
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:42,831
- Mr. Lydell?
- Yes.

394
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:45,997
I'm sorry, I was asking....

395
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:51,283
Mr. Lydell, I don't know
how else to put this...

396
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:54,401
...but if you appear
in front of the press...

397
00:25:54,563 --> 00:25:58,875
...to be at all embarrassed
by your son's homosexuality....

398
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:03,920
I guess, let me just ask:
Do you support the president?

399
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:06,881
- Yes, we do.
- No, we do not.

400
00:26:07,043 --> 00:26:12,720
No, that was really the last--
No, we do not.

401
00:26:13,843 --> 00:26:18,678
The Hate Crimes Bill is fine.
Who gives a damn? I don't care.

402
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,279
We shouldn't make laws
against what's in a person's head...

403
00:26:22,443 --> 00:26:25,719
...but I don't give a damn.
It's fine.

404
00:26:27,123 --> 00:26:30,593
I don't understand how this president,
who I voted for...

405
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:36,201
...I don't understand how he can take
such a weak position on gay rights.

406
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:41,756
Gays in the military,
same-sex marriage, gay adoption.

407
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:44,238
Where the hell is he?

408
00:26:45,163 --> 00:26:47,882
I want to know what
quality of parenting...

409
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,831
...the president feels my son lacked.

410
00:26:52,003 --> 00:26:55,791
This president has served
not one day in uniform.

411
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:58,682
I had two tours in Vietnam.

412
00:26:58,843 --> 00:27:04,315
What quality necessary to being a
soldier does he feel my son lacked?

413
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:11,157
Lady, I'm not embarrassed
that my son was gay.

414
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:13,837
My government is.

415
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:22,043
Will you excuse us a moment?

416
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,915
Mandy....

417
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:41,916
- Send them home.
- They'll be fine.

418
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,392
You heard the man.

419
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:46,236
When it's over,
the press will surround them.

420
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:48,513
- So he says what he says.
- What?

421
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:51,322
He made a reasonable point.
He has a right.

422
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:55,072
- To talk to reporters on our dime?
- Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

423
00:27:56,283 --> 00:28:00,595
- You're the press secretary.
- They said they support the bill.

424
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,634
Get it together.

425
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:18,397
Yeah, all right. I know. I know.

426
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:22,518
- We have to send them home.
- I know.

427
00:28:22,683 --> 00:28:28,599
- I'll go let them know.
- No, no. I'll do it.

428
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,597
I got news for you.

429
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:44,800
PBS claims that most households
are weekly viewers...

430
00:28:44,963 --> 00:28:48,000
...come from the Nielsen index
based on diaries.

431
00:28:48,163 --> 00:28:52,998
They show higher PBS viewing than
those gathered by the automated boxes.

432
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,192
Why?

433
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:57,480
People wanna seem more
sophisticated than they are.

434
00:28:57,643 --> 00:29:01,113
- That's right.
- There's one other thing.

435
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,838
Product licensing for Big Bird
and Fuzzy Bear toys--

436
00:29:05,003 --> 00:29:06,994
- Fozzie Bear.
- Whatever.

437
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:11,162
It's Fozzie Bear, not Fuzzy Bear.

438
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:15,236
Licensing for this merchandise
brings in over $20 million a year.

439
00:29:15,403 --> 00:29:20,431
All of it goes to the show's producer,
the Children's Television Workshop.

440
00:29:20,643 --> 00:29:25,398
This is a company whose CEO
earns high six figures per year.

441
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,919
Yet <i>Sesame Street</i> is subsidized
by taxpayer dollars.

442
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:32,792
- That's a reasonable complaint.
- And?

443
00:29:32,963 --> 00:29:36,638
I don't care.
We're gonna see to all those things.

444
00:29:36,803 --> 00:29:41,354
But when the public is concerned
about sex and violence on TV...

445
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:45,914
...we're gonna protect <i>The Muppets.</i>
We're gonna protect <i>Wall Street Week.</i>

446
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:50,315
We'll protect <i>Live from Lincoln Center</i>
and we'll protect <i>Julia Child.</i>

447
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:52,360
- Toby--
- Hang on.

448
00:29:57,123 --> 00:29:58,476
You wanted to see me?

449
00:29:58,643 --> 00:29:59,758
- Good news.
- What?

450
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,598
Josh and Sam cut a deal.
No hearing. Leo's out of the woods.

451
00:30:03,763 --> 00:30:05,993
Toby, that's great.

452
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:09,155
I gotta get back in there,
this is too much fun.

453
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,835
A town in Alabama
wants to pass a law...

454
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:23,916
...saying if I don't honor my father,
I go to jail.

455
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:26,591
How do they know
if you're honoring him?

456
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:29,033
They've overlooked that problem.

457
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,202
- She's here.
- Send her in.

458
00:30:36,723 --> 00:30:38,042
- Karen Larsen?
- Yes.

459
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,398
- I'm Sam Seaborn.
- I know.

460
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:50,202
The advance man you ratted out
works for the vice president now.

461
00:30:50,363 --> 00:30:52,081
- Screwed yourself.
- I didn't--

462
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:54,882
Trying to win one
for the vice president?

463
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:56,032
I wasn't.

464
00:30:56,203 --> 00:31:01,482
I've got Ginger, a guy from political
liaison and two reporters.

465
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,833
Trying to protect your boss?

466
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:07,439
People say you're acting funny.
Like you're guilty.

467
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:12,671
They think you leaked the advance man
story. I think something else.

468
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,993
I had nothing to do with--

469
00:31:15,163 --> 00:31:18,041
I don't care about the golf
or the helicopter.

470
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:21,878
I don't care about the advance man.
Look at me.

471
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:28,601
Did you give Leo McGarry's personnel
file to Lillienfield and Claypool?

472
00:31:30,563 --> 00:31:32,633
- Oh....
- What?

473
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:38,280
- Mr. Claypool is a family friend--
- Cathy!

474
00:31:43,723 --> 00:31:48,558
Take her to her office and stand there
while she cleans out her desk.

475
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:54,875
Security's gonna throw you
out of the building in 15 minutes.

476
00:31:59,443 --> 00:32:03,152
You're not gonna believe this,
but I'd like a banana.

477
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:06,312
- I'm afraid not, sir, no.
- Why not?

478
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:10,358
- I offered one, and you were snippy.
- I wasn't snippy.

479
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:13,714
I'm afraid you were, Mr. President.
C.J.'s waiting.

480
00:32:14,283 --> 00:32:16,160
Thank you, Mrs. Landingham.

481
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:21,838
She withholds food from me.

482
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,994
I hate to harp on this, but--

483
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,795
- The sex ed report.
- Yes.

484
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:29,000
- We'll leave it alone for a while.
- When you say--

485
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:30,431
After midterms.

486
00:32:30,643 --> 00:32:33,476
A year from now.
We're sticking it in a drawer?

487
00:32:33,683 --> 00:32:35,401
It's pretty incendiary.

488
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,643
You don't think
we have an obligation--

489
00:32:38,843 --> 00:32:41,357
It won't play well at a PTA meeting.

490
00:32:41,523 --> 00:32:44,242
It says we should teach kids
to have sex.

491
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:46,752
Excuse me, but it does not.

492
00:32:46,963 --> 00:32:49,716
Yes, but that's how it's gonna play.

493
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:54,951
Withholding knowledge about sex
doesn't keep teens from having sex...

494
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,512
...it keeps them from doing it safely.

495
00:32:57,723 --> 00:33:03,116
Teaching safe sex doesn't up the rate
of sex, it ups the rate of safe sex.

496
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:07,435
We wanted this report.
They're doctors. We asked a question.

497
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:10,401
We hide it because
we don't like the answer?

498
00:33:10,603 --> 00:33:16,155
At the moment, Congress will only give
funding to sex education programs...

499
00:33:16,323 --> 00:33:18,075
...that teach abstinence--

500
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,921
We have a huge pulpit--

501
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:25,635
We'll avail ourselves of that pulpit
after the midterm elections.

502
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:31,121
I think I understand.

503
00:33:35,523 --> 00:33:40,643
- I needed to get Leo off the hook.
- It's the deal Josh and Sam made.

504
00:33:40,843 --> 00:33:42,037
Yes.

505
00:33:43,203 --> 00:33:47,082
We'll deal with it
after the midterm elections.

506
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:50,553
- I understand.
- I was hoping you would.

507
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:52,600
Yes, sir.

508
00:33:59,723 --> 00:34:03,033
Some of the press already know
the report came back--

509
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:05,236
Yeah.

510
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:08,952
It's okay to tell them we got it.
Don't make a big deal.

511
00:34:09,123 --> 00:34:13,594
We got it, we're looking at it.
Throw it out with the trash.

512
00:34:14,363 --> 00:34:16,194
- Yes, sir.
- Thanks, C.J.

513
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,752
Thank you, sir.

514
00:34:22,723 --> 00:34:24,554
Mr. President?

515
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:28,913
We can all be better teachers.

516
00:34:29,523 --> 00:34:31,115
I know.

517
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,872
C.J.? What are you doing?

518
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:58,876
What're you doing?

519
00:34:59,043 --> 00:35:01,511
I was....

520
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,841
- Nothing.
- Okay.

521
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,641
Danny?

522
00:35:17,443 --> 00:35:19,673
If you call the Lydells and ask--

523
00:35:19,883 --> 00:35:23,273
- Don't leak me a story.
- I wasn't.

524
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:25,235
I've seen that look before.

525
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:29,112
You got a story in the trash that
you want out, someone said no.

526
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:31,513
- They're all stories.
- That happens.

527
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:36,751
- You never took a free lead--?
- I always took a lead. Not from you.

528
00:35:36,963 --> 00:35:38,396
Why?

529
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:42,351
In 20 minutes, you'll remember
you're a professional...

530
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:45,401
...and you're not gonna
like me anymore.

531
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,761
You think I like you now?

532
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:54,679
As long as you keep grabbing me and
kissing me, what the hell do I care?

533
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:56,196
Good point.

534
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,400
- If there's a story, I'll find it.
- No, you won't.

535
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:01,918
How do you know?

536
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:07,077
- Because we've gotten good at this.
- Yes, you have.

537
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:09,717
Yes, we have.

538
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:18,076
- Leo?
- Yeah.

539
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:21,832
- Karen Larsen is here.
- Thanks.

540
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:35,638
- I'm Leo McGarry.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:39,677
I wanted to meet you
and I wanted you to meet me.

542
00:36:39,843 --> 00:36:41,754
Yes, sir.

543
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,955
Would you like
to put that down and talk?

544
00:36:45,123 --> 00:36:48,001
If you don't, I understand.

545
00:36:59,963 --> 00:37:04,400
When you read in my file that I'd been
treated for substance abuse...

546
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:06,997
...what went through your mind?

547
00:37:08,723 --> 00:37:10,202
Karen, it's okay.

548
00:37:10,363 --> 00:37:14,834
The worst thing I can do is fire you,
and I've already done that.

549
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:16,914
My father drank.

550
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:20,473
So did mine.
In fact, he died from it.

551
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:23,279
He came home one night, very drunk.

552
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:29,439
My mother was yelling at him.
I heard the yelling from my bedroom.

553
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:34,358
She came upstairs, and he went out
to the garage and shot himself.

554
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:39,157
Is that why you drank and took drugs?

555
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:44,039
I drank and took drugs because
I'm a drug addict and an alcoholic.

556
00:37:44,483 --> 00:37:47,793
How long did it take you to get cured?

557
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:52,192
I'm not cured.
You don't get cured.

558
00:37:52,363 --> 00:37:56,322
I haven't had a drink or a pill
in six and a half years.

559
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:59,998
Which isn't to say
I won't have one tomorrow.

560
00:38:01,723 --> 00:38:06,035
- What would happen if you did?
- I don't know.

561
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:12,392
Probably a nightmare like both
our fathers experienced. And me too.

562
00:38:14,283 --> 00:38:20,392
So after six and a half years,
you're not allowed to have a drink?

563
00:38:20,563 --> 00:38:25,239
The problem is, I don't want a drink.
I want 10 drinks.

564
00:38:26,323 --> 00:38:28,553
Are things that bad?

565
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:32,401
- No.
- Then why?

566
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,075
Because I'm an alcoholic.

567
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:42,121
- I don't understand.
- I know. It's okay.

568
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:48,199
Hardly anyone does.
It's very hard to understand.

569
00:38:53,763 --> 00:38:57,438
You're not like what I thought
you would be like.

570
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,676
You haven't answered my question yet.

571
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:04,835
When you saw
I'd been through treatment...

572
00:39:05,003 --> 00:39:07,597
...what went through your mind?

573
00:39:09,203 --> 00:39:12,320
My father used to....

574
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:20,956
You have all these important decisions
to make in your job.

575
00:39:21,123 --> 00:39:27,073
Every day. All the time.
Decisions I can't even....

576
00:39:28,203 --> 00:39:31,001
In people's lives.

577
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,197
Karen, what you did
caused a lot of problems.

578
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:49,680
For me, for the president, for a lot
of people we don't even know.

579
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:56,394
But I'm not sure
it wasn't a little bit brave.

580
00:40:01,883 --> 00:40:07,435
- Did you like working here?
- Yes, sir.

581
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:13,275
Then why don't you go
unpack your carton...

582
00:40:13,443 --> 00:40:18,517
...and you and I will give each other
a second chance.

583
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:23,996
Okay.

584
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,562
Okay.

585
00:40:51,003 --> 00:40:53,961
<i>- -a section of the report.</i>
<i>A few quick things.</i>
