1
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,077
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,478
Judge Mendoza, I'm nominating you...

3
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:14,392
...to be the next associate justice
of the Supreme Court.

4
00:00:14,603 --> 00:00:17,595
I'm Sam Seaborn,
deputy communications director.

5
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:19,521
Josh Lyman,
deputy chief of staff.

6
00:00:19,723 --> 00:00:20,712
Jed Bartlet.

7
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:22,242
- Charles.
- Prefer Charlie?

8
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,638
- Zoey?
- If I call you Charlie.

9
00:00:24,883 --> 00:00:29,638
- We've met. McGarry, chief of staff.
- I thought you were the butler.

10
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:32,880
McGarry's chief of staff.
I'm your host, C.J.

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,472
- I'm Ziegler.
- From the White House.

12
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:45,523
Welcome to the third installment
of this year's DuPont Lecture Series.

13
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,915
I see by the turnout,
you're excited to meet our guest....

14
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,193
- What?
<i>- He was arrested.</i>

15
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:56,555
- For what?
- Drunk driving and disorderly conduct.

16
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:00,438
- You think?
- It's 30 minutes old. We don't know.

17
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,032
<i>- What do we know?</i>
- He doesn't drink.

18
00:01:03,243 --> 00:01:06,918
- He was arrested for it.
- Mendoza doesn't drink.

19
00:01:07,123 --> 00:01:09,398
- And the press?
<i>- They know nothing.</i>

20
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,401
- Cops haven't leaked it?
- They don't know.

21
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:16,152
- That they've arrested him?
- That it's that Mendoza.

22
00:01:16,363 --> 00:01:18,001
<i>I got this thing now.</i>

23
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,397
I got a cab.

24
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:22,436
The White House.
I'll let you know.

25
00:01:22,643 --> 00:01:25,521
Stay ahead of the pitch.
Have Toby page me.

26
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:30,592
We don't even know if this guy's
called a lawyer. Is he in a jail cell?

27
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:36,152
You're not there anymore, are you?
I'm talking to no one at all.

28
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:39,833
--where he worked as manager
for the minority whip...

29
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,961
...and chief of staff
for Congressman Brennan.

30
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:48,112
After serving as senior political
director for Bartlet's campaign...

31
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:51,076
...he was appointed
deputy chief of staff.

32
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,400
Please welcome Joshua Lyman.

33
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,800
Thank you very much.

34
00:01:58,003 --> 00:02:00,563
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

35
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,992
- Just slip that mike on, there.
- Let's see here....

36
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:08,752
Tell us what it's like
to work for the president.

37
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,316
I'll do my best.

38
00:02:10,523 --> 00:02:12,514
- What happened?
- It's not bad.

39
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:15,795
- Was the president's nominee arrested?
- Yes.

40
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:19,393
- I thought he doesn't drink.
- He doesn't drink.

41
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:23,482
- He was tonight.
- We vetted him. He doesn't drink.

42
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:26,800
- Why was he arrested?
- Driving while Hispanic.

43
00:02:27,003 --> 00:02:29,801
- Does Toby know?
- I stepped off the world.

44
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:30,992
Yes.

45
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,239
- Where was it?
- Connecticut.

46
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:38,119
- Why refuse the Breathalyzer?
- He's crazy and out to ruin my life.

47
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:41,281
- Anyone posted bail?
- No. Can't find a judge.

48
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:44,680
- Why not?
- It's Friday night in Connecticut.

49
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:48,359
Believe me, I'll figure a way
to blame this on you.

50
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:52,351
- I have no doubt.
- Find his lawyer and talk to him.

51
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,123
Sam, there's an Air Force Lear jet.

52
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:58,002
Fly to Westchester Airport,
rent a car...

53
00:02:58,203 --> 00:03:01,639
...and get the next associate justice
out of jail.

54
00:03:01,843 --> 00:03:06,234
C.J., Sam sees one reporter when he
gets off that plane, I blame you.

55
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:08,394
- Toby's got that.
- I'm going.

56
00:03:08,603 --> 00:03:11,242
The judge and I will
have a conversation.

57
00:03:11,443 --> 00:03:15,914
I want a call every 15 minutes.
I wanna know what's going on.

58
00:04:01,203 --> 00:04:04,752
Tell us about a typical day
at the White House.

59
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:08,842
The first thing I'll tell you
is, there's no such thing.

60
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:13,434
There's a schedule and there's
a structure, to be sure.

61
00:04:13,643 --> 00:04:17,761
And, to a certain extent,
it starts out as a nine-to-five job.

62
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:21,512
But you can count on it
being blown to hell by 9:30.

63
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,392
Give us an example.

64
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:28,598
I'll give you an example
from this week.

65
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:34,595
The story I'm about to tell you
all happened within the last 36 hours.

66
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:37,522
Anyone who's been reading
the papers...

67
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:42,274
...has been following what we call
"the news cycle that wouldn't end."

68
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:47,477
It started either with a
cabinet secretary losing her temper...

69
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:50,481
...a committee chairman baiting her...

70
00:04:50,683 --> 00:04:54,358
...the president answering a question
he shouldn't have...

71
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:58,875
...a dentist appointment,
or me being stupid.

72
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:03,474
For the record, I don't think
it was as much my fault...

73
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,435
...as other people do.

74
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:11,082
It started out as a day
to trumpet the president's vision...

75
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,921
...for education reform.

76
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:16,559
- Give me the bullet points.
- I understand this.

77
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:19,152
- I have confidence in you.
- Thanks.

78
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:23,151
- Give him the points.
- I'm bathed in your confidence too.

79
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:26,082
Forgive student loans
to new teachers...

80
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:30,037
...who spend three years teaching
in inner-city schools.

81
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:34,077
Bonuses to people who leave
careers to become teachers.

82
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:38,242
Federal grants to schools
to use more experienced teachers...

83
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:40,638
...to train the less experienced.

84
00:05:40,843 --> 00:05:45,758
- Half the new teachers quit in 3 years.
- Right here on my index card.

85
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:50,320
- Very good, then.
- Toby. Got a minute?

86
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:52,195
Thank you both.

87
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,759
- Know what? What time's your briefing?
- 11:00.

88
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:03,557
- Push it to 1:00.
- I thought about that.

89
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,755
Do it after the bill.
Let this be the story.

90
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:10,239
- Move it to 1:00.
- You can't. You have the thing.

91
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:13,753
- A perfect excuse to postpone.
- You don't want to.

92
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,158
- A "thing"?
- Dentist appointment.

93
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:19,958
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I'm experiencing pain.

94
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,996
- For how long?
- A month. It'll go away.

95
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:25,080
- When?
- When I die.

96
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:26,636
Carol, cancel it.

97
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:30,199
Set the briefing for 2:00,
keep the appointment.

98
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:34,476
Teeth are your friends.
Care for them, they'll care for you.

99
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:38,471
- When did this talk start?
- I'm nuts for dental hygiene.

100
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:40,560
- Go away now.
- Okay.

101
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:43,231
- She called him a racist.
- She didn't.

102
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:46,116
- What did she say?
- Well, yes, she did.

103
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,235
Bonnie, Ginger,
I want anything on the wire...

104
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:52,799
...about the HUD secretary
calling Wooden a racist.

105
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:54,197
You want it now?

106
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:57,361
No, I want it
at whatever leisurely pace--

107
00:06:57,563 --> 00:07:00,475
- I'm just asking.
- I want it now.

108
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:03,151
On C-SPAN, she called him a racist?

109
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:06,673
Not just Wooden.
She included all Republicans.

110
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:09,477
- Why be good-humored?
- She was baited.

111
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:12,151
- So?
- She was baited and she was right.

112
00:07:12,363 --> 00:07:16,117
- Did you know Deborah O'Leary--
- Is that a wire story?

113
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:22,556
"Wooden's problems with public housing
drew an angry response from O'Leary."

114
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:27,279
And here's what she said:
"Public housing has serious problems.

115
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:32,079
But if you and the Republicans
were as invested in solving them...

116
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:36,276
...as in scoring political points
on the backs of minorities...

117
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:38,439
...you might see the value."

118
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:42,522
- "You calling me a racist?"
- "Of course not," she answered?

119
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:47,877
- "If the shoe fits," she responded.
- Well, wasn't that clever of her?

120
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:53,282
Donald Morales, the spokesman
for Housing and Urban Development...

121
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:57,562
...who's wishing he hadn't
gotten out of bed that morning...

122
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:02,439
...confirms what happened.
Now there's telling the president.

123
00:08:02,643 --> 00:08:05,874
- "If the shoe fits"?
- It gets worse, actually.

124
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,792
"When reporters confronted O'Leary,
she defended--"

125
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,995
- Come on!
- Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

126
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:16,559
- She on her way?
- She'll be here in half an hour.

127
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,082
Mr. President?

128
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,918
"If the shoe fits."
Is that the best she could do?

129
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:26,435
Of her many transgressions,
let's not worry about the cliche.

130
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:30,522
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

131
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:33,396
The president spoke briefly.

132
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:37,642
The president has never spoken
briefly in his life, but....

133
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:41,279
He spoke, signed the bill,
gave away the pens...

134
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:44,759
...then he took a few questions
from the press.

135
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:49,673
It should be pointed out that
according to every poll...

136
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:53,762
...the issue that concerns
Americans most is education.

137
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:58,718
The president had just signed off
on $700 million for education...

138
00:08:58,923 --> 00:09:02,279
...and announced a plan
of aggressive initiatives.

139
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:04,474
What was the first question?

140
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:08,159
Do you agree with O'Leary
that Wooden's a racist?

141
00:09:08,363 --> 00:09:13,676
- If not, will you ask her to resign?
- I have great confidence in O'Leary.

142
00:09:13,883 --> 00:09:17,273
She's done a terrific job
at HUD helping thousands...

143
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:22,398
...transition from joblessness
and homelessness to productive lives.

144
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,798
You didn't answer the question.

145
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:28,154
- I was hoping you wouldn't notice.
- I did, sir.

146
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:32,959
I agree the Republican Party doesn't
have a comprehensive program...

147
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:37,441
...for combating poverty.
But there are countless Republicans...

148
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:40,402
...working to change
their party's legacy.

149
00:09:40,603 --> 00:09:42,798
I hope to be working with them.

150
00:09:43,003 --> 00:09:47,201
I'm sure that was an answer
to some question. Just not mine.

151
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,633
If only we'd stopped it there.

152
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:54,439
If only we'd said, "The president
can't take any questions now."

153
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:59,797
Or, "We'll cover this in the briefing."
Or, "The building is on fire."

154
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:03,202
But it took us all a moment
to realize...

155
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:06,201
...there was no press secretary
in the room.

156
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:11,113
She went too far in assigning
motive to Wooden and the Republicans.

157
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:14,235
- Will you speak to her?
- She'll meet McGarry.

158
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:18,118
- Will he ask her to apologize?
- It'd be appropriate.

159
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:19,915
- Get him off.
- Sam.

160
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,432
We'll cover this in the briefing.

161
00:10:22,643 --> 00:10:25,874
The president's late
for the UN ambassador.

162
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,994
Thank you, everyone.

163
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:32,600
- That went pretty well.
- We'll fix it.

164
00:10:32,803 --> 00:10:37,081
- The UN ambassador is in Portugal.
- Okay. My bad.

165
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:41,874
Eight words: "The president's
not taking any questions right now."

166
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,120
If we'd just stepped in
30 seconds sooner.

167
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,995
That's me.

168
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:49,473
I'm sorry. There's a thing.

169
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:53,955
I have to answer this now.
This will just take a second.

170
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,723
This is weird, I know...

171
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:59,033
...but, anyway--

172
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,914
<i>- It's me.</i>
- Are you there?

173
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,442
- We're lost.
<i>- Lost?</i>

174
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:07,431
- We're not.
- What exit do we want for Wesley?

175
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,873
- We missed the exit.
- We didn't.

176
00:11:10,563 --> 00:11:12,918
I'm in the middle of something.

177
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:16,798
- Just tell me--
- Call me when you know something.

178
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,837
Sorry about that.

179
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:24,163
- Can you tell us what that was about?
- The trade deficit. Where was I?

180
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:28,834
- If you'd gotten there sooner.
- The day would've gone differently.

181
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:32,115
The president said
O'Leary should apologize.

182
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:36,202
The press wanted to know
if she'd be fired if she didn't.

183
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:40,191
We didn't have an answer.
She was coming for a showdown.

184
00:11:40,403 --> 00:11:43,042
This is what the day was about now.

185
00:11:43,243 --> 00:11:48,681
The day was about to get worse, because
I was about to step to the plate.

186
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:53,595
This is wrong.
We're supposed to go east.

187
00:11:53,803 --> 00:11:56,237
- We're going east.
- How do you know?

188
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:59,600
- The sun rises in the east.
- It's dark out.

189
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,442
That bright star in the sky
is Polaris.

190
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:05,316
- So?
- I'm using celestial navigation.

191
00:12:05,523 --> 00:12:08,799
Galileo, get off the next exit
and turn around.

192
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:13,235
Secretary O'Leary was told that
Leo McGarry wanted to see her.

193
00:12:13,443 --> 00:12:18,517
No question she'd be angry about
the president asking her to apologize.

194
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:21,635
But at the moment,
that was Leo's problem.

195
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:24,562
- I can't believe it.
- You're pissed at us?

196
00:12:24,763 --> 00:12:28,472
How could he demand an apology
without hearing my side?

197
00:12:28,683 --> 00:12:32,119
We blew the press event
but I got a video of your side.

198
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:34,678
- The man's a racist.
- Maybe.

199
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:38,876
He uses his authority to spit
at the poor and minorities.

200
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:44,111
He's doing it to score points
with his narrow-minded constituents.

201
00:12:44,323 --> 00:12:47,838
His narrow-minded constituents
are also ours.

202
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:51,638
When are you guys gonna stop
running for president?

203
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:53,993
When angels dance on pinheads.

204
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:59,323
We need their votes for many issues,
including the budget for HUD.

205
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:04,313
- Attacking HUD is attacking blacks.
- Thanks. Having been born yesterday.

206
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:09,074
Don't you think it's my role as
the highest-ranking African-American--

207
00:13:09,283 --> 00:13:14,516
I think your role, first and foremost,
is to serve the president.

208
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:19,001
A task today at which
you failed spectacularly.

209
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:24,600
- Leo--
- You're gonna apologize.

210
00:13:29,403 --> 00:13:31,234
- I'm sorry.
- Not to me.

211
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:35,561
- I called it like I saw it.
- Now you'll apologize for it.

212
00:13:35,763 --> 00:13:37,993
- I can't.
- You can.

213
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:41,832
- I won't.
- You will.

214
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,999
Is that an order?

215
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:51,355
You're doing great work.
The president's nuts about you.

216
00:13:51,563 --> 00:13:55,033
He'll cry for three minutes
after he fires your ass...

217
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:57,598
...then he'll say, "What's next?"

218
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:05,113
Leo, if I've gotta go
and ask Wooden for forgiveness...

219
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:08,395
...he'll lord it over me
until the end of time.

220
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,675
It's the cost of doing business.

221
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,197
Done.

222
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:20,996
He's been provoking you for months.

223
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:25,196
When you give in to him,
you surrender the high ground.

224
00:14:26,723 --> 00:14:28,122
How did it happen?

225
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:31,440
You forgot what your grandfather
taught you.

226
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:36,637
- "Never argue with a drunk or a fool."
- Is the president very angry with me?

227
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,317
He's upset you couldn't come up...

228
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:42,799
...with anything better than
"If the shoe fits."

229
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,280
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

230
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:50,238
<i>So that should have been it.</i>
<i>C.J. does the 2:00 briefing...</i>

231
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:52,917
...tells them O'Leary
has an apology...

232
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:57,759
...all questions will be handled
by her spokesperson, Donald Morales...

233
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,161
...and redirects their attention
to the $700 million of yours...

234
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,593
...that we spent on teachers.

235
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,880
Who here has had emergency root canal?

236
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:15,560
- What the hell happened?
- I had root canal.

237
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:19,756
- What happened to your cheeks?
- I had root canal.

238
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:23,319
- Why are you talking like that?
- I had root canal!

239
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:28,472
- I heard you. I was amusing myself.
- You can do other things with yourself.

240
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:31,072
- Are you in pain?
- I had root canal!

241
00:15:31,283 --> 00:15:34,161
Stop saying that.
You sound ridiculous.

242
00:15:34,363 --> 00:15:37,275
- I have to cancel the briefing.
- You can't.

243
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:39,314
- Look at me!
- You'll be great.

244
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,401
I can't do it.
I can't even say "briefing."

245
00:15:42,603 --> 00:15:47,393
You gotta wrap up O'Leary and
move them back to the bill signing.

246
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:51,278
- Did you say my name?
- You really think I can do it?

247
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:55,392
Don't be insane. You can't do it
looking like Bullwinkle.

248
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,401
Again, you were just
having a little fun.

249
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:02,391
- When can you take the cotton out?
- Two hours. I'll cancel.

250
00:16:02,603 --> 00:16:04,355
- We're still doing it.
- Who?

251
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,635
- Me.
- No way. You get hostile.

252
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,879
I get hot stuff?

253
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,997
Hostile! You get hostile!

254
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:17,719
I don't. I get hostile
when the hostility is called for.

255
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:19,197
Let Sam do it.

256
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:22,600
- He's in Foggy Bottom.
- Why's he in Foggy Bottom?

257
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:27,479
I just wanted to make you say
"Foggy Bottom." He's with the writers.

258
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:30,072
- Toby?
- Toby's with the president.

259
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:33,912
This is Josh coming at you
with your 2:00 briefing.

260
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:39,072
Please, be very careful.
Try very hard not to destroy us.

261
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:42,434
You shouldn't say that.
You got a great body.

262
00:16:42,643 --> 00:16:44,395
Here we go!

263
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,962
Please take your seats.
We'll start the briefing.

264
00:16:50,723 --> 00:16:54,841
- You're not gonna do this.
- I talk to reporters all the time.

265
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:57,796
You really don't wanna do this.

266
00:16:58,203 --> 00:17:02,754
Let me tell you something, <i>mi</i>
<i>compadre.</i> You guys have been coddled.

267
00:17:02,963 --> 00:17:06,399
I'm not your girlfriend
or your camp counselor...

268
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,992
...or your sixth-grade teacher.

269
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:14,482
I'm a graduate of Harvard and Yale.
My powers of debate can rise to meet...

270
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:18,596
...the Socratic wonder
that is the White House press corps.

271
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,157
Okey-dokey.

272
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:23,997
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

273
00:17:24,203 --> 00:17:28,037
<i>C.J. had an emergency,</i>
<i>so I'll handle the briefing.</i>

274
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:31,879
In my defense, first of all,
everything was fine.

275
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:35,792
I dispensed of the O'Leary
matter with ease and poise.

276
00:17:36,003 --> 00:17:40,679
I opened to questions with a discipline
lacking in C.J.'s briefings.

277
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:43,158
I'll take one question apiece.

278
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,557
- Josh.
- Mike.

279
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:48,798
When's the last time
the president had a cigarette?

280
00:17:49,163 --> 00:17:51,631
You want yours to be that stupid?

281
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,913
<i>- It's not stupid.</i>
- Oh, my God.

282
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:57,320
<i>If the president</i>
<i>is adamantly anti-tobacco...</i>

283
00:17:57,523 --> 00:18:00,560
...why is it unreasonable
to ask if he smokes?

284
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:02,082
He quit years ago.

285
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:06,276
He bummed a cigarette from me
on Air Force One two days ago.

286
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,077
Oh, my God.

287
00:18:09,203 --> 00:18:12,036
Well, then.... Jonathan.

288
00:18:12,243 --> 00:18:17,033
- So you won't answer Katie's question?
- I'll look into it. Danny.

289
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,235
Economists worry the drop
in unemployment...

290
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:23,833
...will create pressure on wages,
driving them up.

291
00:18:24,043 --> 00:18:27,922
Is the president worried
about a resurgence of inflation?

292
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:29,954
The president is pleased...

293
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:33,951
...that unemployment has dropped
another 0.5 percent--

294
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:39,442
We join him in his joy. I'm wondering
if he has a plan to fight inflation.

295
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:43,636
He will maintain the robust economy
that has created jobs...

296
00:18:43,843 --> 00:18:47,518
...improved productivity,
and kept a lid on inflation.

297
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:51,636
But he has no plan
to address inflation specifically?

298
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:56,837
Twenty-four Ph.D.s on a council of
economic advisors? They have a plan.

299
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,762
Are you not telling
because it's a secret?

300
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,238
Yeah, we have a secret plan.

301
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:09,395
I guess that's pretty much
when the wheels came off the wagon.

302
00:19:09,603 --> 00:19:11,719
Now is a good time to break.

303
00:19:11,923 --> 00:19:14,960
Let's stretch our legs
for five minutes.

304
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:18,473
Sign-up sheets for 202
are in the lobby.

305
00:19:18,683 --> 00:19:23,199
If you smoke, apparently you can
bum a cigarette on Air Force One.

306
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:27,191
Let's have a hand
for our guest, Joshua Lyman.

307
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:39,395
- You're great.
- Thanks.

308
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:48,842
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Sam feels we're zeroing in on it.

309
00:19:49,043 --> 00:19:50,840
You haven't found it yet?

310
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:54,041
We've been navigating
by the North Star...

311
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:57,320
...which turned out to be
the Delta shuttle.

312
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:00,515
How hard is it
to find the police station?

313
00:20:00,723 --> 00:20:05,717
I don't know. Can you tell me about
the secret plan to fight inflation?

314
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:10,119
- How long before you let up on that?
<i>- A little while.</i>

315
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:12,154
Call when you know something.

316
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:17,595
There's a store. I'll ask where
the Wesley police station is.

317
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:21,637
Or you can pull in there,
at the police station, and ask.

318
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:25,882
- Look! We found it.
- Let's get this done and get out.

319
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:37,875
Good evening.

320
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:39,476
Good evening.

321
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:44,843
Sam Seaborn. I work for the president.
Is your watch commander around?

322
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,318
- Is this a joke?
- No.

323
00:20:47,523 --> 00:20:49,718
You walk in and tell me that?

324
00:20:49,923 --> 00:20:54,872
We're in trouble. The good thing is,
you're in more trouble than we are.

325
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:59,998
The sooner you realize I'm telling
the truth, the better off we'll be.

326
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:03,001
Why don't you get
your watch commander?

327
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:15,277
If we'd stayed on the parkway
instead of going east...

328
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:19,795
...I don't think we'd have wound up
in Bridgeport so many times.

329
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:24,517
- Shut up.
- I'm Sgt. MacNamara. Can I help you?

330
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:29,433
I'm the deputy communications director.
That's my boss, Toby Ziegler.

331
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,362
- I'm in no mood for a joke.
- I understand.

332
00:21:32,563 --> 00:21:35,714
You have Roberto Mendoza
locked up back there.

333
00:21:35,923 --> 00:21:38,642
State your business here, or leave.

334
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:42,882
I'm telling you to unlock the cell
and give me Mendoza.

335
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:48,396
You come in here at 10:00 at night,
tell me you're with the White House--

336
00:21:52,923 --> 00:21:55,198
You've arrested a federal judge...

337
00:21:55,403 --> 00:21:59,396
...who's the president's nominee
for the U.S. Supreme Court.

338
00:22:01,123 --> 00:22:05,196
You should get that.
That's the governor of Connecticut.

339
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:12,762
Danny had thrown me a knuckle ball,
which then I had taken a swing at...

340
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:18,595
...and, just like that, the president
had a secret plan to fight inflation.

341
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:22,394
When will the president
unveil his secret plan?

342
00:22:22,603 --> 00:22:25,401
There is no secret plan.
I was kidding.

343
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:29,994
These are people's jobs.
You wanna give us a straight answer?

344
00:22:31,723 --> 00:22:34,112
I can't remember the question.

345
00:22:35,163 --> 00:22:40,112
Given the reduction in unemployment,
is there a plan to fight inflation?

346
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:43,201
And if so, why is he
keeping it a secret?

347
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,712
Oh, my God. I mean, oh, my God!

348
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:56,312
- I can fix this.
- I don't think so.

349
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,912
This is a great time for support.

350
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,877
- You have my support.
- That's a start. What should I do?

351
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,280
Come up with a secret plan
to fight inflation.

352
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,394
- That's support?
- Joshua!

353
00:23:08,603 --> 00:23:13,631
- That's the face I wanted to see.
- What the hell happened in there?

354
00:23:13,843 --> 00:23:16,198
You completely imploded!

355
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,156
- What'd I do?
- You completely imploded.

356
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:23,879
- You were vague, hostile, belligerent.
- Belligerent.

357
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,359
- Know what it'll take to fix this?
- I'll fix this.

358
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:30,202
You're never allowed in my press room.

359
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:32,997
- See if Toby was watching.
- Where is he?

360
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,272
Never mind.

361
00:23:34,483 --> 00:23:36,872
- Just support me on this.
- No!

362
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:40,314
Have you fallen and hit your head?

363
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:42,878
- I feel really bad.
- You do?

364
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:46,877
That's all that matters.
That was some good television.

365
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,836
Four network news directors
will agree.

366
00:23:50,043 --> 00:23:52,955
This isn't as bad
as you're making it seem.

367
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:55,631
A secret plan to fight inflation?

368
00:23:55,843 --> 00:23:59,119
C.J., for a little while
you'll have to write it down.

369
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:01,439
- We have a problem.
- No kidding.

370
00:24:01,643 --> 00:24:03,042
- Not Josh.
- Praise God.

371
00:24:03,243 --> 00:24:07,316
Calling a question stupid
is not a page out of Carnegie.

372
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,594
- What's wrong?
- You won't like it.

373
00:24:09,803 --> 00:24:14,797
The only thing that could make my day
worse is if Mendoza got involved.

374
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:20,722
Roberto Mendoza is the president's
nominee for the Supreme Court.

375
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:25,872
The president put Toby in charge of
his confirmation. Huge responsibility.

376
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:30,634
A failed confirmation for the Court
is a body blow to a presidency.

377
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:35,997
Besides, he's a brilliant jurist,
and we badly want him on the bench.

378
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:41,397
The confirmation process is tough.
You gotta make a lot of friends.

379
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:44,879
Nominees don't speak
before their confirmation.

380
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:47,802
They let the White House
speak for them.

381
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:51,120
Something Toby's had trouble
teaching Mendoza.

382
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:53,992
He said the president was wrong?

383
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:57,513
He said he was wrong
to make O'Leary apologize.

384
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,435
- C.J.
- Sam, tell him.

385
00:24:59,643 --> 00:25:02,953
He said he was wrong
to make O'Leary apologize.

386
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:04,596
- To who?
- To Wooden.

387
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,556
- Who did he say it to?
<i>- Chicago Tribune.</i>

388
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:11,199
I thought he's on vacation
in Nova Scotia.

389
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:14,076
- He is.
- They called him in Nova Scotia?

390
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:15,955
How did they find him?

391
00:25:16,163 --> 00:25:20,793
They have telephones in Nova Scotia.
It's not Amish country.

392
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:26,601
Of all the people in this building,
you want to be the last to speak now.

393
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:27,997
You bet.

394
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,197
The president needs to be briefed.

395
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:38,112
If you use the words
"pwesident" or "bwiefed" again--

396
00:25:38,323 --> 00:25:41,315
The president's in New Orleans
in an hour.

397
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:45,562
No press at the conference.
When he's done, he comes home.

398
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:49,153
He'll be in the residence by 3:30 a.m.

399
00:25:49,363 --> 00:25:51,593
Can I say something?

400
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,601
What?

401
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:59,877
A lot of this is our fault, and
the president won't take this well.

402
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:03,155
We'll be there with you
in spirit tomorrow.

403
00:26:03,363 --> 00:26:06,912
You'll be there with me
in every way imaginable.

404
00:26:07,523 --> 00:26:10,481
- You bet.
- 7 a.m.

405
00:26:10,723 --> 00:26:14,079
This is not the first time
this had happened.

406
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,878
In the eight weeks since
he was named the nominee...

407
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:22,122
...Mendoza has, on various
occasions, publicly criticized...

408
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:27,158
...the American Bar Association, the
AFL-CIO and the NY state legislature.

409
00:26:27,363 --> 00:26:31,879
Groups, without which, this
president wouldn't have been elected.

410
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:36,042
Putting out the O'Leary fire
had been our only success.

411
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:39,121
Now Judge Mendoza had
started up again.

412
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:43,794
I'm really very sorry,
but I have to take this.

413
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,157
- Yeah.
<i>- Josh.</i>

414
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:48,035
- Yeah.
- We're in.

415
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:50,120
<i>- Where is he?</i>
- With Toby.

416
00:26:55,323 --> 00:26:57,996
Hello, Mr. Justice.

417
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,994
How are you?

418
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:05,796
Incarcerated, Toby. How are you?

419
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:08,278
- Do you need anything?
- No.

420
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:11,361
The judge and I are gonna have a chat.

421
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:21,200
The hardest job in the White House
is president.

422
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:24,395
The second-hardest job
is not chief of staff...

423
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,834
...national security advisor,
or press secretary.

424
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:32,161
Although, I'm gaining respect
for press secretaries.

425
00:27:32,363 --> 00:27:37,483
The second-hardest job belongs to a
21-year-old kid named Charlie Young.

426
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:40,720
He's the president's body man,
his aide.

427
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:45,758
He's with him morning to night.
He has a range of responsibilities.

428
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:48,352
But the one he hates most is this:

429
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:52,715
Sometimes, it's his job to wake
the president in the morning.

430
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:57,792
On this morning, the president
had gone to sleep three hours earlier.

431
00:27:58,003 --> 00:28:01,996
<i>- White House. Operator Four.</i>
- Good morning, Helen.

432
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:05,240
<i>- How was New Orleans?</i>
- He did well.

433
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:09,402
<i>- You been to sleep since yesterday?</i>
- Good one.

434
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:13,801
- Time for his wake-up call.
<i>- Let me put you through.</i>

435
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:29,632
- What?
- Good morning. It's Charlie. I hope--

436
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:32,641
What could you possibly
want right now?

437
00:28:32,843 --> 00:28:35,994
- Sir, it's 6:30 a.m. and--
- In the morning?

438
00:28:36,203 --> 00:28:38,353
Yes. I wanted to remind you--

439
00:28:38,563 --> 00:28:43,796
What in the name of everything holy
could you want now?

440
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:47,518
You have a 7 a.m. meeting
with the senior staff...

441
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:50,476
...followed by
intelligence briefings...

442
00:28:50,683 --> 00:28:55,234
...and a meeting with the chairman
of the Fed. Would you like coffee?

443
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:58,037
- Who the hell is this?
<i>- Sir.</i>

444
00:28:58,243 --> 00:29:00,677
And what could you possibly want?

445
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:04,952
Sir, I need you to dig in now.
It wasn't a nightmare.

446
00:29:05,163 --> 00:29:08,360
- You really are the president.
- All right.

447
00:29:08,563 --> 00:29:13,591
- I'll have the steward bring coffee.
- I'll get up now.

448
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:19,841
Mendoza was summoned
to the White House from Nova Scotia.

449
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:24,275
When you summon someone,
you expect them within the hour.

450
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:27,759
Mendoza told us
he'd see us in three days.

451
00:29:27,963 --> 00:29:30,875
Why three days?
He was driving down to D.C...

452
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,836
...stopping in Connecticut
to do some antiquing.

453
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:38,036
Another thing to tell the president,
who still hadn't awoken.

454
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:39,995
- Charlie.
- Oh, come on.

455
00:29:40,203 --> 00:29:43,798
I've been knocking.
I don't hear the shower running.

456
00:29:44,003 --> 00:29:46,995
Thanks, Billy.
Give me a minute, would you?

457
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:04,798
Mr. President.

458
00:30:11,163 --> 00:30:14,599
Are you aware
you're committing a federal crime?

459
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:18,159
I'll take my chances with the feds.
It's 7:00.

460
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:21,673
How did you know
the first lady wasn't naked?

461
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:26,001
- Come to think of it, where is she?
- Argentina.

462
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:27,756
That's right.

463
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:30,272
Senior staff in the Oval Office.

464
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:35,557
So I'll stand here while you get
out of bed, shower and get dressed.

465
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,401
All right.

466
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:46,637
- Have you slept yet?
- No, sir.

467
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,595
Good.

468
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:05,957
How's your mouth?

469
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:09,997
Well, the swelling's gone down.

470
00:31:10,963 --> 00:31:14,194
On the other hand,
the painkillers wore off.

471
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:17,554
He's driving from Nova Scotia
to Washington?

472
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,594
How's a person do that?

473
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:23,034
Take the Trans-Canada Highway
to New Brunswick...

474
00:31:23,243 --> 00:31:26,121
...catch the 1,
the scenic route along Maine...

475
00:31:26,323 --> 00:31:28,962
...95 through to the Mass Pike...

476
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:32,200
...then the Merritt Parkway
around Milford.

477
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:36,000
There's something freakish about you.

478
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:41,402
I'm tired, cranky and my wife's in
Argentina. Let's get this over with.

479
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:58,795
What?

480
00:31:59,003 --> 00:32:03,872
Mr. President, we experienced a few
public relations-- What's the word?

481
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:05,277
Catastrophes.

482
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:10,193
- Incidents in the hours you were away.
- What kind of incidents?

483
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:22,640
First, the incident involving O'Leary
and Wooden has been dispensed with.

484
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:26,392
Though not really.
I'll get to that at the end.

485
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:31,723
Sam asked C.J. to move the briefing
so we could fold in the teachers.

486
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:36,519
C.J. had emergency root-canal surgery
and was unable to brief.

487
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:38,441
- Who did?
- I did.

488
00:32:39,363 --> 00:32:40,637
Oh, God.

489
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:46,361
You're going to be reading today about
your secret plan to fight inflation.

490
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:49,714
- I have a secret plan for inflation?
- No.

491
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:52,437
Why am I gonna be reading that I do?

492
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,953
It was suggested in the press room
that you did.

493
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:58,074
- By who?
- By me.

494
00:32:58,283 --> 00:33:01,480
You told the press
I have a secret plan?

495
00:33:01,683 --> 00:33:04,914
Let me be absolutely clear:
I did not do that.

496
00:33:05,123 --> 00:33:08,877
- Except, yes, I did that.
- I'm a little confused.

497
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,756
There was this idiotic round robin.

498
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:15,353
It was sarcastic.
There's no way they didn't know.

499
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:19,272
They were just mad at me
for calling them stupid.

500
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:20,677
Before we go on:

501
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:24,922
C.J., if blood is gushing
from a head wound you received...

502
00:33:25,123 --> 00:33:29,082
...from a stampede of bison,
you'll do the briefings.

503
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,477
Yes, sir.

504
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:32,958
- Mr. President--
- A secret plan?

505
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:36,872
There was no turning them back.
They wouldn't take no.

506
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,562
- Were you clear?
- Yes.

507
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:43,279
They said, "If he has a plan,
is it right that he keep it secret?"

508
00:33:43,483 --> 00:33:45,439
I said, "Of course not."

509
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:50,558
Are you telling me that not only
did you invent a secret plan...

510
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,994
...but now you don't support it?

511
00:33:55,643 --> 00:33:58,396
- When you put it like that--
- Mr. President.

512
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:02,562
Much as we'd love nothing more
than to stand and watch you...

513
00:34:02,763 --> 00:34:07,120
...beat the living crap out of Josh,
there's a bigger fish to fry.

514
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:09,120
What did Mendoza do?

515
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:13,555
He told the <i>Tribune</i> you were wrong
to make O'Leary apologize.

516
00:34:13,763 --> 00:34:15,754
- I didn't. He did.
- You told me to.

517
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:17,681
- You said you'd fix it.
- I did.

518
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:20,681
- It's broken again.
- Because your nominee...

519
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:24,478
...is handling himself
in an unprofessional manner.

520
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:28,073
We'll have the first
of a series of discussions...

521
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:30,922
...about professionalism another time.

522
00:34:31,123 --> 00:34:33,591
- Where is Mendoza?
- He's on his way.

523
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:37,682
- Right now?
- He'll be here the day after tomorrow.

524
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:41,273
- From Neptune?
- He's vacationing with his family.

525
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:45,874
They'd prefer to take a drive
through Canada and New England...

526
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:48,597
...while stopping
for antique shopping.

527
00:34:48,803 --> 00:34:51,954
He'll take the Trans-Canada Highway--

528
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:54,802
Okay, we'll wait for Mendoza.

529
00:34:55,003 --> 00:34:58,882
In the meantime, C.J.,
you'll untangle the press corps.

530
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:03,281
We'll hope nothing happens today
to make this any worse.

531
00:35:03,483 --> 00:35:07,112
Although I wouldn't bet
the house on it. That is all.

532
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:09,393
Thank you, Mr. President.

533
00:35:17,003 --> 00:35:18,959
I want to tell you I'm sorry.

534
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:22,473
This will be cleaned up
in a professional manner.

535
00:35:22,683 --> 00:35:24,116
Good.

536
00:35:25,883 --> 00:35:28,841
If anyone asks,
you quit smoking years ago.

537
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,035
The cigarette you bummed
was for a friend.

538
00:35:32,243 --> 00:35:33,756
- Get out.
- You bet.

539
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:35,157
<i>That was it.</i>

540
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:38,161
- What happened to Judge Mendoza?
- I'm sorry?

541
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:41,878
- Did he get here from Nova Scotia?
- He's on his way.

542
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:45,792
He's spending the night
in Connecticut to do antiquing.

543
00:35:46,803 --> 00:35:50,034
- He's been in there a little while.
- Yeah.

544
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:55,077
I'm the one that pulled him over.

545
00:35:55,283 --> 00:35:59,799
His driving was erratic. I'm not
convinced he hadn't been drinking.

546
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:02,642
- You have a problem there.
- What's that?

547
00:36:02,843 --> 00:36:07,871
He has chronic persistent hepatitis.
Non-progressive liver inflammation.

548
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:12,440
If he'd had enough to drink
to blow .1, he'd be dead right now.

549
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,361
This is good coffee.

550
00:36:17,123 --> 00:36:19,683
Why didn't you take the Breathalyzer?

551
00:36:19,883 --> 00:36:24,911
I was driving within the speed limit
on the right side of the road.

552
00:36:25,123 --> 00:36:30,516
I have valid tags and I don't have
warrants for my arrest in Connecticut.

553
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:34,682
Absent just cause,
a Breathalyzer's an illegal search...

554
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,078
...and a civil-rights violation.

555
00:36:37,283 --> 00:36:40,355
So you give him a hard time
to make a point?

556
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:42,793
- A point worth making.
- Not now.

557
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:44,800
- Right now.
- One phone call:

558
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:50,555
"Toby, this happened. Tell them I'm
Mendoza and I'm named to the bench."

559
00:36:50,763 --> 00:36:55,234
They pulled me over because I look
like my name is Roberto Mendoza...

560
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:58,799
...and I'm coming to rob your house.

561
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:03,157
Let's go.

562
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,752
- Where are we going?
- Let's go home.

563
00:37:05,963 --> 00:37:08,477
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Judge!

564
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:11,117
- I'm under arrest.
- Not anymore.

565
00:37:11,323 --> 00:37:15,714
You pull all the strings you want
but not for me.

566
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:19,711
Come Monday, I'll avail myself
of the justice system...

567
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:22,721
...for which I have worked
my entire life.

568
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:25,596
Judge, due respect, let's go.

569
00:37:25,803 --> 00:37:29,193
My kid was in the car, Toby.

570
00:37:29,403 --> 00:37:33,919
They patted me down
and handcuffed me in front of my boy.

571
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:35,795
Then he and his mother...

572
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,996
...got to see them put me
in the squad car and drive away.

573
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,995
He's also seen you wearing a robe
with a gavel in your hand.

574
00:37:47,203 --> 00:37:51,435
He doesn't understand that.
He doesn't know what that is.

575
00:37:51,643 --> 00:37:55,113
He understands who the police are
because of TV.

576
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:59,157
That's what he'll remember.
His father being handcuffed.

577
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:03,481
So America just got another
pissed-off guy with dark skin.

578
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:13,081
- Robbie and Laura, where are they?
- Motel, a few miles.

579
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:17,754
There's nothing about this
that doesn't stink.

580
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:23,913
If it were me, I'd want vengeance.
I'd say, "Let justice be done."

581
00:38:24,123 --> 00:38:28,036
I'd also want to spend time
in a dark room alone...

582
00:38:28,243 --> 00:38:31,997
...so that I didn't have to face
my wife and my son...

583
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,195
...and have them see my humiliation.

584
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:43,355
Bob, I can't get this done
if this is the story.

585
00:38:45,883 --> 00:38:48,522
Nothing about this that doesn't stink.

586
00:38:48,723 --> 00:38:53,194
Nothing that wouldn't be better
if you were a Supreme Court justice.

587
00:38:56,123 --> 00:39:01,151
Let me take you to the motel.
Go see your boy.

588
00:39:06,963 --> 00:39:09,397
So, can I ask?

589
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:14,802
A guy in your job, do you know
missile codes and that sort of thing?

590
00:39:16,123 --> 00:39:19,195
- Yeah.
- Outstanding.

591
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:26,919
- Good evening, Mr. Justice.
- Good evening, Sam.

592
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,320
- He's got personal items?
- Yes, sir.

593
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:38,315
It's your lucky night.

594
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:43,313
There isn't going to be a report,
an investigation or suspension.

595
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:48,392
And no one's filing a $100-million
lawsuit that they would surely win.

596
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:52,278
But in this room,
you'll apologize to Mr. Mendoza.

597
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:58,399
Then you'll get in your squad car,
follow us and apologize to his son.

598
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:01,118
Judge Mendoza...

599
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:05,001
...we sincerely apologize
for our mistake.

600
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:10,401
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

601
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:16,234
You could do a better job
of marking the exits on the thruway.

602
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:18,001
Let's go.

603
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:20,518
We'll be behind you.

604
00:40:27,403 --> 00:40:32,033
If there's no reason for you to
go back, you should spend the night.

605
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:35,440
- What's up here?
- Great antiquing.

606
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:39,318
You're killing me, judge.
Absolutely killing me.

607
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:42,351
Josh? It's over.

608
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:45,319
Good.

609
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:52,321
That's the last time
the phone will ring, I promise.

610
00:40:55,163 --> 00:40:59,315
There's a part of the story
I didn't tell you.

611
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,956
I can't.

612
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:04,479
It doesn't involve--
I just can't, right now.

613
00:41:04,683 --> 00:41:08,437
Ask me back again
after the Senate confirms Mendoza.

614
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:11,362
You should hear it. It's a good story.

615
00:41:11,563 --> 00:41:14,714
<i>- Why don't we take some questions?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

616
