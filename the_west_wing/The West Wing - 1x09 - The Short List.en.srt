1
00:00:06,803 --> 00:00:07,872
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:12,401
- I can't do this anymore.
- This is the most important thing.

3
00:00:12,603 --> 00:00:17,119
- It's not more than your marriage.
- It is more important now.

4
00:00:17,323 --> 00:00:19,314
- What are you wearing tonight?
- What am I wearing?

5
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:22,123
- Your paper wants to know?
- That's for me.

6
00:00:22,363 --> 00:00:25,116
- When was the last time you went?
- To AA?

7
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:29,115
- What meeting could I go to?
- Mine.

8
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:32,875
Something I can help you with,
Mr. McGarry?

9
00:00:33,723 --> 00:00:36,112
I'm here for the card game.

10
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:44,155
Yes.

11
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:48,874
Yes.

12
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:53,081
Yes.

13
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:59,074
Are you prepared at this point--?

14
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:06,802
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

15
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:08,920
If you sit by the phone...

16
00:01:09,123 --> 00:01:12,513
...you can expect a call
from the president.

17
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:14,879
Thank you again.

18
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,481
- It's done.
- We did it!

19
00:01:18,723 --> 00:01:19,792
It's done!

20
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:23,399
C.J. was on the phone
with her fingers crossed.

21
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:27,875
- You did one phone call.
- It was a series which I masterminded.

22
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:33,277
While I'm not selfish about credit,
it is done and I did it!

23
00:01:33,483 --> 00:01:35,872
Call Toby, Sam, Leo, the president.

24
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,877
Tell them I'm on my way over.
Nothing to the press.

25
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:41,351
- Claudia Jean?
- Yeah?

26
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:43,872
- We did it.
- Yeah!

27
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:47,994
Don't you wanna know
about the banging?

28
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:51,155
- Banging?
- They've been at it all morning.

29
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:56,079
- What are you talking about?
- A loud banging above your office.

30
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:58,678
- I didn't notice.
- How could you not?

31
00:01:58,923 --> 00:02:03,519
I've been on the phone to fill
a seat on the Supreme Court.

32
00:02:03,763 --> 00:02:05,481
It was pretty loud.

33
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:09,079
I'm talking about
the U.S. Supreme Court.

34
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:12,281
- Who the man?
- We the man!

35
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:15,555
- This is just gross.
- Wait here for me.

36
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:19,716
- Morning, Mrs. Landingham.
- Good morning.

37
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,676
- Yes, Mrs. Landingham.
- Is it done?

38
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:27,713
That depends on your answer
to this question:

39
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:32,081
- Who the man?
- Excuse me, Josh?

40
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,881
- Who the man?
- You the man.

41
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,761
- We the men!
We the men!

42
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:40,881
- He's waiting for you.
Thank you.

43
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:46,321
- I heard we may have a-- I can call?
- Yes, sir!

44
00:02:46,563 --> 00:02:49,316
He's waiting for you, sir. It's done.

45
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:54,199
- You got a Supreme Court nominee.
- Which one of you is the man?

46
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:57,515
We'd like to think of ourselves
as "the men."

47
00:02:57,723 --> 00:02:59,679
Let's make the phone call!

48
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:02,312
- Congratulations, sir.
- Well done, sir.

49
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,360
Thank you. You too.

50
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,879
- You guys rock.
- We really do.

51
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:14,397
Bring in the chairman, a member from
Judiciary, leadership from both sides--

52
00:03:14,563 --> 00:03:17,680
- Where is C.J.?
- Right here. Sorry.

53
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:20,995
You should wear a bell.
What do we wanna do?

54
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:26,522
C.J., tell the press the president
introduces his nominee Thursday.

55
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:30,676
- Could we do it on Friday?
- People watch TV on Thursday.

56
00:03:30,883 --> 00:03:32,953
- We can do this in 4 days?
You sure?

57
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,876
You run the show.
Put the ball in the hole.

58
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:39,320
- It's done.
- No, it's not. So get it done.

59
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,515
- Get me everything.
- We vetted him two months.

60
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,879
We'll vet him four more days.

61
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:49,082
I wanna know every girlfriend
he stood up in 1953.

62
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:53,282
This show will be better
than the queen's coronation.

63
00:03:53,523 --> 00:03:56,595
Sam, you'll write Harrison's remarks.

64
00:03:56,843 --> 00:03:59,880
- He's not gonna like that.
- He'll like it fine.

65
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,275
If the name of this nominee
is leaked before I want...

66
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,720
...I'll blame you.
You'll find that unpleasant.

67
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:10,562
Toby, you're hot
when you're like this.

68
00:04:10,803 --> 00:04:14,591
I am gonna put Harrison on the Court!
I swear to God!

69
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:17,681
- We meet again, three hours.
C.J., talk to me.

70
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:20,596
- Did you see his face?
- We're home.

71
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,994
- I'll see you later.
- It's a maintenance crew.

72
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:26,478
- The banging.
- Working upstairs.

73
00:04:26,723 --> 00:04:29,635
- Peyton Cabot Harrison Ill.
- Yes.

74
00:04:29,843 --> 00:04:33,722
He sounds like he should be
a Supreme Court Justice.

75
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:37,672
- It's a good name.
- Phillips Exeter, Rhodes scholar...

76
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,483
<i>...Harvard Law Review</i> editor.

77
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:43,556
He was dean of Harvard Law School.

78
00:04:43,763 --> 00:04:46,880
His father was Eisenhower's
attorney general.

79
00:04:47,123 --> 00:04:50,160
Peyton Cabot Harrison Ill.
Jewish fellow?

80
00:04:50,403 --> 00:04:51,995
You're not gonna ruin this.

81
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,916
- I'm sharing this moment.
- This is big.

82
00:04:55,163 --> 00:04:57,882
- You know what we'll have?
- A waspy old man?

83
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,273
A smooth confirmation process.

84
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,553
- It's gonna sail.
- I hope so.

85
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:07,996
- A slip twixt the tongue and wrist--
- It's gonna sail.

86
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:10,319
- Don't get your hopes up.
- Why?

87
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:14,556
When it doesn't work out,
you end up drunk in my apartment.

88
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,873
- Smooth sailing.
- Cautious optimism.

89
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:19,876
- Nothing bad will happen.
- Cautious optimism.

90
00:05:20,123 --> 00:05:22,478
There is no reason--

91
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,481
Well....

92
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,481
Okay.

93
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:22,071
You're too young to retire, Joseph.

94
00:06:22,323 --> 00:06:25,395
You're an excellent liar,
Mr. President.

95
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:27,520
Yes, sir.

96
00:06:30,643 --> 00:06:35,000
- You're gonna go with Harrison?
- He's on the short list.

97
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:36,278
Yeah.

98
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:39,233
With how many other names?

99
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:43,072
We'll make our announcement
on Thursday.

100
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:47,515
- You've decided on Harrison.
- I haven't made a decision yet.

101
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:50,882
You made the call.

102
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,997
- Did you consider Mendoza?
- He was on the short list.

103
00:06:57,203 --> 00:07:02,596
He was on the short list so you could
show you had a Hispanic on it.

104
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:07,200
- That's not true.
- You ran great guns in the campaign.

105
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:11,316
It was an insurgency,
boy, a sight to see.

106
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:14,123
Then you drove to the middle
of the road...

107
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:19,642
...the moment after you took the oath.
The middle of the road.

108
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:22,482
Nothing but a long line,
painted yellow.

109
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:23,877
Excuse me, sir--

110
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:29,675
I wanted to retire five years ago,
but I waited for a Democrat.

111
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:33,080
I wanted a Democrat.

112
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:35,954
And instead, I got you.

113
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:53,841
- Hey. How you doing?
- Doing fine, Danny.

114
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,271
Is it Harrison?

115
00:07:55,523 --> 00:07:59,675
Why do you ask me questions
you know I'm not gonna answer?

116
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:03,074
- Good conversation starter.
- I can't date you.

117
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:07,680
Think Harrison's gonna be a good
Justice? I tried to trick you.

118
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:10,756
Didn't work.
You won't go on a date?

119
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,681
- Right.
- Okay.

120
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,917
- We should get out there.
- Not yet.

121
00:08:23,163 --> 00:08:24,357
I am running--

122
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:27,595
I've served on this bench
for 38 years.

123
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:31,279
I took my seat
the year you began college.

124
00:08:31,523 --> 00:08:34,674
I believe I've earned
the right to say a word.

125
00:08:34,883 --> 00:08:38,273
- You've said quite a few words.
- Not enough.

126
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:39,512
Let's go.

127
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,561
Take the next few days
with your staff...

128
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:46,113
...and give Mendoza
the consideration he deserves.

129
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:48,001
When the next seat opens--

130
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:51,679
When it does,
you'll be writing your memoirs.

131
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:57,122
- In three years, I hope--
- You're gonna get beat in three years.

132
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:58,876
That's pessimistic.

133
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:03,674
The American voters like guts,
and Republicans have got them.

134
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:07,671
And in three years,
one of them is gonna beat you.

135
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,281
I imagine the view...

136
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:16,472
...from your unscrutinized place in
history must be different from mine.

137
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,592
But I'd remind you, I have
the following things to negotiate:

138
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:26,963
An opposition Congress, special
interests and a bitchy media.

139
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:30,155
- So did Harry Truman.
- I'm not Harry Truman.

140
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:35,073
Mr. Bartlet, you needn't
point out that fact.

141
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:40,119
It's Dr. Bartlet, Your Honor.

142
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,753
Now, let's go start your retirement.

143
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,399
- Want my gloves?
- No, thanks.

144
00:09:50,643 --> 00:09:52,918
- You look pretty cold.
- I'm fine.

145
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:56,473
- What are they talking about?
- They're old friends.

146
00:09:56,723 --> 00:10:00,113
- They can't stand each other.
- It's a courtesy call.

147
00:10:00,363 --> 00:10:01,921
- What do you want?
- Dinner.

148
00:10:02,163 --> 00:10:05,121
- Think he's pissed about Harrison?
- Danny!

149
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,593
- I did it again!
- Yes.

150
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:10,152
- You outfoxed me.
- You're killing me.

151
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,081
Here we go.

152
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:26,875
- That was inches from my head.
- It was not.

153
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:29,683
It was inches. A bit that way, bam!

154
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:31,680
- Head wound.
- You're fine.

155
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:36,075
- Yeah, there but for the grace of God.
- Yes.

156
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:39,719
If big chunks are gonna
fall down on anyone....

157
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:41,879
I don't know.

158
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,755
- What?
- It should be you.

159
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,561
I knew you'd say that.

160
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:49,840
From now on, I want you
to test my office.

161
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:54,192
- Staff in 10 minutes.
- See this? Inches from my head.

162
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:56,843
Lillienfield's holding
a press conference?

163
00:10:57,043 --> 00:11:01,002
- Who cares?
- Why is he holding a press conference?

164
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,632
- Is he unhappy?
- He's always unhappy.

165
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:06,915
- Donna, where's my East Asia memo?
Here!

166
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:11,076
It starts in two minutes.
Lillienfield's conference!

167
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:14,912
- I'll just get it myself!
Keep your pants on.

168
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:20,197
- We don't need any surprises today.
- We're not gonna have any.

169
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:24,874
- I don't wanna get upstaged.
- You're not gonna get upstaged.

170
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:26,512
- Here.
- Thank you.

171
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,196
You're welcome.

172
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:31,276
You should be nice to me.
I could be dead.

173
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,281
I don't have that kind of luck.

174
00:11:35,683 --> 00:11:40,473
Play up that, as a lifelong Democrat,
he clerked for a Republican.

175
00:11:40,683 --> 00:11:45,996
Play down that he's never written
a judicial opinion on abortion.

176
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:48,512
- I'm already there.
- Well, thank you.

177
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:50,276
What's this?

178
00:11:51,163 --> 00:11:54,075
Lillienfield's talking
about something.

179
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,883
I couldn't be less interested.

180
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,318
- I'll be in my office.
- Okay.

181
00:11:59,563 --> 00:12:02,031
<i>Gone are the days of the best.</i>

182
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:06,600
<i>Stained are the legacies</i>
<i>of the great White House staffers.</i>

183
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:11,075
<i>Names like Schlesinger,</i>
<i>Sorensen, Rumsfeld, and Persons...</i>

184
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:15,714
<i>...have been replaced</i>
<i>by Ivy League liberals...</i>

185
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:17,959
<i>...and Hollywood darlings.</i>

186
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:22,714
<i>One in three of who, one in three...</i>

187
00:12:22,963 --> 00:12:28,196
<i>...use drugs on a regular basis.</i>

188
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:31,719
<i>And so there's</i>
<i>no confusion about my meaning...</i>

189
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:34,875
<i>...I'm not talking about aspirin.</i>

190
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:38,712
<i>My staff will pass out</i>
<i>the most recent figures.</i>

191
00:12:38,963 --> 00:12:40,191
Get her.

192
00:12:41,283 --> 00:12:44,036
- C.J.
- Tell him I'm watching.

193
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:47,918
<i>Who exactly is it that's helping</i>
<i>lead our country?</i>

194
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:51,917
<i>Who has the ear of the president,</i>
<i>advising the president?</i>

195
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:58,194
He said one in three
White House staffers were on drugs?

196
00:12:58,443 --> 00:13:01,321
- Yes.
- Where does he get these stats?

197
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,315
Out of the clear blue sky.

198
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,599
- Bring me a tape on this.
- We are.

199
00:13:05,843 --> 00:13:08,915
- This isn't happening to me.
- Stay cool.

200
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:13,122
Is it possible for Peter Lillienfield
to be a bigger jackass?

201
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,598
Do you think he could if he tried?

202
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:19,079
- At some point he'd hit the ceiling.
- Maybe not.

203
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,722
- What's up?
- Josh.

204
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:24,751
I would like to say to
the 1.6 of you who are stoned...

205
00:13:24,963 --> 00:13:27,431
...that it's time to share.

206
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:29,122
This isn't funny.

207
00:13:29,323 --> 00:13:32,713
If you can't laugh,
you're not having enough fun.

208
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:35,272
He's a featherweight, a hairdo.

209
00:13:35,483 --> 00:13:39,112
I think he could be a slightly
bigger gasbag.

210
00:13:39,323 --> 00:13:41,473
- If he reached for the stars.
- Morning.

211
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:43,594
- You never saw this coming?
- Toby.

212
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:47,796
Leo, forgive me,
but nobody saw this coming?!

213
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:52,713
I can't believe my psychic didn't
tell me! I'll get my money back.

214
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,437
- Short-term, long-term?
- Nothing.

215
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:58,316
I can't pretend we didn't see it.

216
00:13:58,523 --> 00:14:01,640
He's a liar.
Categorically deny it and move on.

217
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:03,515
- She can't.
- Why not?

218
00:14:03,763 --> 00:14:06,835
More than 1300 people
work for the White House.

219
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:13,312
I deny anyone uses drugs and three
guys in the photo lab blew a joint...

220
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:17,038
...which is not out of the realm
of possibility--

221
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:22,556
- You denied it. Now there are three.
- I deny there are any more than three.

222
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:28,514
Then the White House beverage
assistant confesses to being a junkie.

223
00:14:28,723 --> 00:14:31,283
And she's selling her story.

224
00:14:31,523 --> 00:14:34,879
Are we done
with <i>Masterpiece Theater</i>?

225
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:40,439
We're looking into it.
That's what we're saying right now.

226
00:14:40,643 --> 00:14:45,922
I don't care if we say that, but
we're not actually doing it, are we?

227
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:48,040
- Yes.
- This is a joke, right?

228
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:50,199
- Leo.
- Yeah.

229
00:14:50,443 --> 00:14:52,957
- Toby.
- Yeah.

230
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:59,558
Go do your briefing. The president
saw Crouch this morning.

231
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,119
We've got some exciting names
on the short list.

232
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:06,992
This business with Lillienfield....

233
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:10,519
- I haven't seen it yet.
- Is the president aware?

234
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:13,721
- We like to measure what credibility--
- Good.

235
00:15:13,963 --> 00:15:18,081
- If the alternative is waiting--
- We don't postpone.

236
00:15:18,283 --> 00:15:19,602
- End this.
- How?

237
00:15:19,803 --> 00:15:21,316
- You know.
- I don't.

238
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:22,717
- What I'm saying--
- Go back to work.

239
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,721
- No. I want to hear what--
- Go back to work.

240
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:29,962
Lillienfield is on our stage,
and he's not gonna get off.

241
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,881
- No taking drug tests.
- Why?

242
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,472
- Because we're not!
- Let's end this.

243
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:39,274
Shut up. Go. Sam, go back
to doing what you're doing.

244
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,720
- They delivered Harrison's papers.
- Start reading.

245
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:46,641
What do we know?
What do they know?

246
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:51,121
No, wait. I'm not gonna be
the internal affairs cop here.

247
00:15:51,323 --> 00:15:56,272
- You wanna know, ask them yourself.
- This isn't the time.

248
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,878
But there is a principle here--

249
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,712
We've done this a year.
All we've gotten is older.

250
00:16:02,923 --> 00:16:05,312
Our job approval's only 48 percent.

251
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:10,039
I'm tired of being captain for
the gang that couldn't shoot!

252
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:17,560
What do they know?
Start with me if you want.

253
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:32,072
Hello. This is Sam Seaborn.

254
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,074
What's your name?

255
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:41,482
I'm not a cop. What's your name?

256
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:45,073
Where are you right now?

257
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:49,674
I'm the only one in my office,
but as soon--

258
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,556
You know what? Hang on. I'm on my way.

259
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:01,593
A quick confirmation's good.

260
00:17:01,843 --> 00:17:04,880
Ritter says we'll get
90 votes in the Senate.

261
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:08,718
That's a blowout!
Just what the doctor ordered!

262
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:11,602
- Morning, Mrs. Landingham.
- Good morning.

263
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,192
- When is Harrison getting in?
- Tonight.

264
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:16,115
- Charlie.
- Good morning.

265
00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:20,322
Peyton Cabot Harrison.
Find out what cigars he likes...

266
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:24,317
...his wife's favorite perfume,
and send them to their hotel.

267
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:25,598
Back channel?

268
00:17:25,843 --> 00:17:28,676
- They'll stake hotels.
- Back channels.

269
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,711
- What is going on with Lillienfield?
- You stay out of it.

270
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:34,151
Anything else?

271
00:17:34,363 --> 00:17:37,355
- We're gonna get this done?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,555
- Mr. President.
- On my way.

273
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:42,482
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

274
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,480
- Leo?
- Yes, sir?

275
00:17:44,723 --> 00:17:48,272
We looked at everybody, right?
We looked at Mendoza?

276
00:17:48,523 --> 00:17:51,117
We looked at him.
We fixed on Harrison.

277
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:53,399
You're right. See you later.

278
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,803
Sorry to keep you waiting. Let's go.

279
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,641
Morning.

280
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:04,879
Hang on a second.

281
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,875
Morning. Keep your seats.

282
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:11,153
Good morning, Mr. President.

283
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:13,917
- Morning.
- Morning.

284
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:17,599
Put together some information
on Mendoza.

285
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:20,994
Sir, it's natural
to have second thoughts--

286
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:25,594
I don't want it to be,
"We had a Hispanic on the list."

287
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:28,601
- What are you looking for?
- Why not him?

288
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:32,921
- Because Harrison said yes.
- Let's do better than that.

289
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,358
What's with this drug thing?

290
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:40,114
- You don't want a piece of that.
- I trust you. Thanks.

291
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:42,593
- Good morning.
- Morning, Sam.

292
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:46,358
He wants me to look at Mendoza.

293
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:51,074
I got a phone call from a guy
with information. I read it.

294
00:18:51,323 --> 00:18:52,995
- It's not good.
- Drugs?

295
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,915
- No.
- What is it?

296
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:58,041
- It's Harrison.
- Close the door.

297
00:19:03,723 --> 00:19:07,716
Every member of <i>Law Review</i>
has to prepare an unsigned note.

298
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:09,481
I know what it is.

299
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:13,841
It's 40 pages, well-researched,
revised, then published.

300
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:17,718
- Without the names.
- It's a scholarly work.

301
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:22,155
How do we know--? I'm supposed
to trust the guy on the phone?

302
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:26,879
I spent three months reading
everything Harrison's written.

303
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,881
He is the author of the unsigned note.

304
00:19:33,523 --> 00:19:35,320
Bonnie!

305
00:19:39,243 --> 00:19:40,232
Yeah?

306
00:19:40,443 --> 00:19:44,675
I'm gonna need the next five minutes
the president's got.

307
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:51,956
- How does Lillienfield get info?
- He's on the Oversight Committee.

308
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:55,354
These people decide if we get
heat and electricity.

309
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:58,117
- They have background information?
- Yes.

310
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,402
Don't feel uncomfortable
about interviewing me.

311
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,713
I talked to you, I hired you.

312
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:08,353
You know anybody who uses drugs?
Wanna tell me who?

313
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:11,117
- No.
- Consider yourself interviewed.

314
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,718
- I've seen your records.
- I know.

315
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,999
"No parking" means "no parking."

316
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:19,474
- Sometimes I can't find a space.
- Go to work.

317
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:25,391
- Everyone takes a drug test.
- Why do you think everyone can pass?

318
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:30,199
- Those who can't will quietly resign.
- Okay. Problem solved.

319
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:35,397
What is wrong with demonstrating that
the White House is drug-free?

320
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:38,754
I think people would be
comfortable knowing...

321
00:20:39,003 --> 00:20:43,281
...that they won't be forced to give
evidence against themselves.

322
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:48,113
Do not paint your position as anything
but preservation of a spotlight.

323
00:20:48,323 --> 00:20:52,999
This gets bungled, we won't have
to struggle to find the spotlight.

324
00:20:57,363 --> 00:21:01,117
- What's really going on here?
- I don't know.

325
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,718
- Me neither.
- That makes me nervous.

326
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,402
What do I do?

327
00:21:06,403 --> 00:21:09,873
It's time to talk to
whoever it is you talk to.

328
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,876
Yeah.

329
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:23,873
Is there reason to believe White House
staffers use illegal drugs?

330
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,156
For those who didn't understand,
we are looking into this.

331
00:21:28,403 --> 00:21:31,873
- A blunt question.
- These haven't been blunt yet?

332
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:34,956
- Do you use drugs?
- No. You're forgiven.

333
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:39,679
It's been 24 hours since
Lillienfield made his accusations--

334
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,836
We've got over 1300 people.
That's a lot of information.

335
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:48,952
We aren't loaded with free time.
No one here has been subpoenaed.

336
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:52,081
Lillienfield offers nothing
to support his claim.

337
00:21:52,323 --> 00:21:55,235
We don't feel a need
to do this in a hurry.

338
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,762
That's all.

339
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:03,282
Set fire to the room. Do it now.

340
00:22:08,923 --> 00:22:10,993
- How you doing?
- What do you want?

341
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:13,120
- Bit of a blunder.
- It was fine.

342
00:22:13,363 --> 00:22:15,877
You challenged Lillienfield
for evidence.

343
00:22:16,123 --> 00:22:17,556
I left my notebook.

344
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:21,193
Did you wanna be the first
to say "subpoena"?

345
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:23,718
It's the only word
anyone will read.

346
00:22:23,963 --> 00:22:27,273
- I don't need your tips.
- That's not why I'm here.

347
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:31,198
- Why are you here?
- The Knicks play tomorrow--

348
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,359
- I don't have time!
- Neither do I.

349
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:38,472
We could watch it in your office
while I explain it to you.

350
00:22:38,723 --> 00:22:39,951
Thank you anyway.

351
00:22:40,203 --> 00:22:44,116
I'll explain in a way
a girl would appreciate.

352
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,639
Danny. You got a minute?

353
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:51,842
Walk me to my car.

354
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:58,272
Information I get, I have to print.

355
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:00,280
- Do you have information?
- No.

356
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:02,474
- Would you tell me?
- What kind?

357
00:23:02,723 --> 00:23:04,714
You know what kind.

358
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:07,921
Why should I hand over
any information I get?

359
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:10,074
- You're right.
- I know.

360
00:23:10,323 --> 00:23:13,076
- Sorry.
- It's not my job to help you out.

361
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:14,802
I know that.

362
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:19,917
Lillienfield's a jackass
but not stupid.

363
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:22,723
- If he's talking, he's got something.
- What?

364
00:23:22,963 --> 00:23:26,512
It's small potatoes,
enough to get the rock rolling.

365
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:28,754
- What's he trying?
- I don't know.

366
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:32,200
- The nomination?
- Harrison's gonna sail by.

367
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:34,593
No one said it's Harrison.

368
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:38,916
My point is, he's not gonna
waste it on a done deal.

369
00:23:39,163 --> 00:23:41,882
He's after something better.

370
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:47,034
- Okay. Thanks.
- Josh.

371
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:50,679
This is one of those times.
Don't screw this up.

372
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:54,474
- C.J. likes goldfish.
- What?

373
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:57,954
She likes goldfish.
Can't get enough of them.

374
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,875
Thanks!

375
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:05,555
Here's an interesting statement,
"While enjoying my privacy...

376
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:09,881
...I admit that government
has a right to invade privacy...

377
00:24:10,123 --> 00:24:14,514
...unless prohibited by a specific
constitutional provision."

378
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:20,395
It's an argument that privacy isn't a
right guaranteed by the constitution.

379
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:22,679
Why hasn't this been brought up?

380
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:26,074
We spent two months,
vetting our nominee...

381
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:28,712
...and it never came up?

382
00:24:28,963 --> 00:24:32,273
It was never an issue
in a ruling he handed down.

383
00:24:32,523 --> 00:24:34,593
We're not sure he's the author.

384
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:40,400
If he is, we can't hold him responsible
for something he wrote when he was 26.

385
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:45,592
Not if we've put him on the bench,
where this issue is gonna come up!

386
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,081
Harrison gets in when?

387
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,076
- Later tonight.
- I want him in the morning.

388
00:24:54,323 --> 00:24:59,113
When was the last time you slept?
I don't care. Get ready for this.

389
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,393
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

390
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:02,877
Thank you, sir.

391
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,114
17 billion won't fly.

392
00:25:05,323 --> 00:25:08,633
They're gonna say
it's too much at 13.5.

393
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:13,233
Excuse me. Give us the room.

394
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:18,640
I want to meet Mendoza.

395
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:22,082
Yes, sir.

396
00:25:34,723 --> 00:25:36,634
Does he know why he's coming?

397
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:42,640
He's interviewing for a job on the
Commission for Hispanic Opportunity.

398
00:25:43,323 --> 00:25:48,443
- Is there such a thing?
- It's the best I could do, Toby.

399
00:25:48,643 --> 00:25:50,156
I made a letterhead.

400
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:54,635
- It must've taxed your creativity.
- Toby!

401
00:25:54,843 --> 00:26:00,440
Judge Harrison, are you the
author of this unsigned note?

402
00:26:06,363 --> 00:26:07,557
Yes, sir.

403
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:13,633
At 26, I wrote a paper supporting the
deregulation of Far East trade barriers.

404
00:26:13,883 --> 00:26:17,637
Nearly got thrown out
of the London School of Economics.

405
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:19,879
I was young and stupid.

406
00:26:20,123 --> 00:26:21,397
Yes, sir.

407
00:26:21,603 --> 00:26:25,676
I'll bring Toby and Sam
in here and talk about this.

408
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:29,842
- That's fine, sir.
- Okay. Charlie, please.

409
00:26:32,603 --> 00:26:36,232
- Toby. You got a minute?
- Yeah?

410
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:38,838
They're about to call me in.

411
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:45,518
Privacy? He doesn't
acknowledge the protection?

412
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:49,921
- When were you gonna tell me?
- I don't report to you.

413
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:51,715
He wrote it 25 years ago.

414
00:26:51,923 --> 00:26:55,040
- He hasn't changed.
- We don't know that.

415
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:57,843
You don't care whether he has or not.

416
00:26:58,043 --> 00:27:01,274
You're painting a picture
for the president.

417
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:05,641
- He can paint his own picture.
- But he listens to you!

418
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:13,282
When did we get the idea
that Harrison was our guy?

419
00:27:13,523 --> 00:27:16,196
We used to talk.
It was never Harrison.

420
00:27:18,323 --> 00:27:20,041
Toby.

421
00:27:20,483 --> 00:27:23,236
- Yeah?
- They're ready for you.

422
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:45,280
Leo, Josh was wondering
if you had a moment.

423
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:46,842
Yeah.

424
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,636
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey.

425
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:01,641
You're the guy with the worst
job in the building this week.

426
00:28:02,603 --> 00:28:07,631
I was interrogating this intern from
the Legislative Liaison's office.

427
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:12,638
She broke down crying telling me
she made a bong out of an eggplant.

428
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:15,477
- You can do that?
- I used to use a potato.

429
00:28:15,723 --> 00:28:18,237
You've always been industrious.

430
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:23,274
Lillienfield's not after that kid...

431
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:26,242
...and he's not after
the senior staff.

432
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:28,041
Yeah.

433
00:28:29,803 --> 00:28:35,161
Leo, you know that
the worst-kept secret in Washington...

434
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:39,362
...is that you're
a recovering alcoholic, right?

435
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,514
I had a hunch.

436
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:47,677
Leo, you're Boston Irish-Catholic.

437
00:28:47,923 --> 00:28:52,678
Back there and back then,
a drinking problem wasn't a problem.

438
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:55,642
This isn't what he's after.

439
00:28:56,923 --> 00:29:02,441
Were you maybe into something
that wasn't so acceptable?

440
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:07,242
Pills.

441
00:29:08,923 --> 00:29:11,232
Were you in treatment?

442
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,961
Sierra Tucson, six years ago.

443
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:19,475
The records they keep
are confidential.

444
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,634
He's got them.

445
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:30,032
You're Leo McGarry.

446
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:37,036
You're not going to be taken down
by this small fraction of a man.

447
00:29:40,123 --> 00:29:43,195
I won't permit it.

448
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:55,673
Judges are bound to interpret
the Constitution...

449
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:58,761
...within the strict parameters
of the text.

450
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:04,033
The Constitution doesn't provide
for a right of privacy.

451
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:09,232
The Third Amendment says soldiers
can't be quartered in private homes.

452
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:13,396
Do you deny the right
to privacy lives in that passage?

453
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,436
No, but the fact that the Framers...

454
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:20,358
...enumerated those protections
is reason to believe...

455
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:24,602
...they didn't intend to make
privacy a de facto right.

456
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:28,637
After the revolution, they had
no question of their freedoms.

457
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:32,034
The Bill of Rights was meant
to codify the rights.

458
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:36,834
- I do this for a living.
- So do I, Your Honor.

459
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:42,111
Peyton, do I have the right to put
on an ugly plaid jacket...

460
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:46,396
- ...and walk down Main Street?
- Yes.

461
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:51,233
- And where is that right guaranteed?
- First Amendment.

462
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,441
What about the use
of cream in my coffee?

463
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:57,755
There can be no free speech argument
made there.

464
00:30:58,243 --> 00:30:59,232
No.

465
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:04,876
You'd have no objection to New
Hampshire banning the use of cream.

466
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:08,234
I would have strong objection,
Mr. President.

467
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:13,079
But I'd have no constitutional basis
to strike down the law...

468
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:15,234
...in the Supreme Court.

469
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:19,237
As I lose the votes
of coffee drinkers everywhere.

470
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:23,993
- Hey.
- Hey.

471
00:31:24,203 --> 00:31:26,398
- What you doing?
- You were right.

472
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:29,760
The word "subpoena" appears
in every lead.

473
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,153
- I know.
- Not yours.

474
00:31:32,363 --> 00:31:34,638
Just because I couldn't spell it.

475
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:37,351
- What are you holding?
- A goldfish.

476
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:39,958
- Why?
- It's for you.

477
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:43,161
- Really?
- Josh said you like goldfish.

478
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:58,240
The crackers, Danny.
The cheese things you have at a party.

479
00:31:58,523 --> 00:32:01,435
Oh. Well.

480
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:04,561
I'm not sure I was supposed
to know that.

481
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,601
- The crackers.
- Fine. Now I got a goldfish.

482
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:13,832
- You'll kill it.
- Think I can't take care of a fish?

483
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,358
- I do not.
- Name's Gail, by the way.

484
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:21,040
- The fish? You named it Gail?
- No. The guy in the store.

485
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,638
Come here.

486
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:29,521
Thanks for the fish.

487
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,831
Keep your head in the game.

488
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:49,482
In 1787, there were delegates
who were opposed to the Bill of Rights.

489
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:53,875
This is what a member of the Georgia
delegation had to say:

490
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:57,752
"If we list a set of rights,
some fools will claim...

491
00:32:58,003 --> 00:33:02,042
...that the people are entitled
only to those rights."

492
00:33:02,283 --> 00:33:05,081
Were you just calling me a fool?

493
00:33:05,323 --> 00:33:08,520
I wasn't, the brand-new state
of Georgia was.

494
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:12,602
Gentlemen, laws must emanate
from the Constitution.

495
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:17,115
- There are natural laws.
- I do not deny there are natural laws.

496
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:21,151
I only deny that judges
are empowered to enforce them.

497
00:33:21,403 --> 00:33:22,677
Then who will?

498
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:26,518
That's not up to me.
And this sideshow is over.

499
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:30,961
With all due respect,
I find this kind of questioning rude.

500
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:33,631
Then you'll enjoy meeting the Senate.

501
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,431
Be that as it may, it's disgusting.

502
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,639
We all know you need me.

503
00:33:39,883 --> 00:33:42,920
I read the same
polling information you do.

504
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:48,675
Seven-to-ten-point bump, unanimous
out of committee. I was courted.

505
00:33:48,923 --> 00:33:52,598
Now you've had me taken
to school by some kid.

506
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,840
That Sam is young
drives me nuts too.

507
00:33:56,083 --> 00:34:01,032
But he took you out for a ride
because that's what I told him to do.

508
00:34:03,323 --> 00:34:07,077
I am a well-credentialed man,
Mr. President.

509
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:11,316
And I am unaccustomed
to this sort of questioning.

510
00:34:12,923 --> 00:34:16,632
I understand, Peyton.
Could you give us a little time?

511
00:34:16,883 --> 00:34:20,432
We'll make you comfortable
while you're waiting.

512
00:34:27,043 --> 00:34:28,158
Put him on a bus.

513
00:34:28,403 --> 00:34:30,837
That's a confirmation we let go...

514
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:35,480
...based on an old paper no one will
ever know about but us.

515
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:40,239
You don't think Sam's guy would know
how to call a senator?

516
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:44,874
- If this is about abortion--
- It's about the next 20 years.

517
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:48,240
'20s and '30s,
it was the role of government.

518
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,638
The next decade, it'll be privacy.

519
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:54,080
I'm talking about the Internet,
health records...

520
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:56,837
...and who's gay and who's not.

521
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:00,638
And in a country born on
the will to be free...

522
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:04,034
...what could be more fundamental
than this?

523
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:07,642
Toby?

524
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,641
Let's meet Mendoza.

525
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:20,637
- They're meeting with Mendoza.
- Yeah.

526
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:26,594
Yeah, and I'm just gonna go
kill myself now.

527
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:32,682
- You think he'd be a bad Justice?
- I think he makes a lousy nominee.

528
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:37,673
- He's in favor of same-sex marriage.
- He's not recommending it.

529
00:35:37,923 --> 00:35:42,633
- He says the state can't interfere.
- He broadly interprets free speech.

530
00:35:42,883 --> 00:35:45,875
Listening to you,
I wish he'd narrow it.

531
00:35:46,123 --> 00:35:49,240
I'm the one who has to sell this.

532
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:53,396
He is not America's idea
of a Supreme Court Justice.

533
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:56,640
Let's do a side-by-side comparison.

534
00:35:57,283 --> 00:36:02,676
Harrison went to Walnut Park,
Princeton undergrad and Harvard Law.

535
00:36:02,923 --> 00:36:06,279
Mendoza attended
P.S. 138 in Brooklyn...

536
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:09,674
...and the New York Police Academy.

537
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:12,642
Harrison clerked for Berger. Mendoza--

538
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:15,955
New York City Police Department,
'65 to '76...

539
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:19,479
...Assistant District Attorney,
'76 to '80.

540
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:23,039
Assistant U.S. Attorney,
Federal District Judge.

541
00:36:23,283 --> 00:36:28,073
He went to law school the hard way.
He got shot in the leg.

542
00:36:28,323 --> 00:36:31,679
He took a desk job
and went to law school at night.

543
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,198
He is brilliant and compassionate.

544
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:38,919
You don't think he's America's idea?
You don't have enough faith.

545
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:43,639
It's the White House senior staff
I don't have faith in.

546
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:48,553
This isn't easy.
If all hell breaks loose...

547
00:36:48,803 --> 00:36:52,239
...over Lillienfield,
it could cripple us for a year.

548
00:36:52,483 --> 00:36:57,682
The law of large numbers says we gotta
win one of these days, right?

549
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:01,711
- Yeah.
- So let's make it a good one.

550
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:05,875
I still hate you.

551
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:08,832
Whatever.

552
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,637
- Who was that?
- Roberto Mendoza.

553
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:38,081
It's not necessary for you to stay.

554
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,042
The president asked me to stay
with you.

555
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:44,036
- I'll stay outside if you like.
- Thanks.

556
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,435
- Like anything?
- Coffee.

557
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,082
Yes, sir.

558
00:37:48,323 --> 00:37:51,201
You look familiar.
Is it possible we've met?

559
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,076
I caddied at Sandy Hook, sir.

560
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:57,360
Of course. Charlie. Of course.

561
00:37:57,563 --> 00:37:58,837
I'll get your coffee.

562
00:38:08,243 --> 00:38:11,679
I'm sure we're almost done.
Sam, what else you got?

563
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,483
Your rulings have been upheld...

564
00:38:14,723 --> 00:38:18,875
...by the Court of Appeals more than
any other district judge.

565
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:22,832
That's what comes from being right
most of the time.

566
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:27,637
- You need me?
- For just a moment.

567
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:30,443
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.

568
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,841
Mr. President....

569
00:38:41,043 --> 00:38:44,479
- What is it, Leo?
- There's gonna be trouble.

570
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:47,157
- Lillienfield?
- Yes, sir.

571
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:49,874
- He knows?
- We think so.

572
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,034
- "We"?
- Josh has it.

573
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:55,559
- What does Josh say?
- Get through it.

574
00:38:56,723 --> 00:39:00,875
- Josh is a smart guy.
- No, sir, Josh is a young guy.

575
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,643
We used to be too.

576
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:06,838
- Did you have a drink yesterday?
- No.

577
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,039
- You gonna have one today?
- No.

578
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:12,036
That's all you have to say to me.

579
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:17,360
You know it's gonna make things
very hard for a while.

580
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:21,755
You fought in a war, got me elected.
You run the country.

581
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:24,801
I think we all owe you one, don't you?

582
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,673
Did Harrison get off okay?

583
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:35,279
Yes. There's a crowd
building outside your office.

584
00:39:35,523 --> 00:39:39,402
- Word's gotten out what's going on.
- I'll bet it has.

585
00:39:39,603 --> 00:39:40,831
More questions, Sam?

586
00:39:41,043 --> 00:39:43,432
- No, sir.
- I have one, sir.

587
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:48,115
This is not an easy commission
to get appointed to.

588
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:52,719
What would you say of someone
being fired...

589
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,199
...for refusing a drug test
at the president's order?

590
00:39:56,683 --> 00:40:00,437
Without details
or special circumstances?

591
00:40:01,323 --> 00:40:05,441
I'd say the order constitutes
an illegal search.

592
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:09,636
I'd order that the employee
be reinstated.

593
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:15,239
- Toby?
- Sold.

594
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:23,911
Would it surprise you to learn...

595
00:40:24,123 --> 00:40:28,435
...that your name has been
on the short list for the bench?

596
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:30,401
Yes, Mr. President.

597
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:34,155
Then this
is gonna knock your socks off.

598
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,121
Tomorrow evening at 5:00...

599
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:42,671
...I am naming you as my nominee to be
the next Justice of the Supreme Court.

600
00:40:42,883 --> 00:40:48,640
You were not the first choice,
but you are the last and right one.

601
00:40:50,483 --> 00:40:52,838
Will you accept the nomination?

602
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:58,795
- With honor.
- Good!

603
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:03,320
Sam and Toby are
in charge of your confirmation.

604
00:41:03,523 --> 00:41:04,638
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

605
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:08,080
It's gonna be a battle
I don't intend to lose.

606
00:41:08,283 --> 00:41:13,641
- Leo, you up for a good fight?
- I believe I have one in me, sir.

607
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:15,595
