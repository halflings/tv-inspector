1
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:08,028
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:10,548
You look like
you could use a client.

3
00:00:10,713 --> 00:00:12,385
Wanna work for the leader
of the free world?

4
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:17,673
Our job approval's 48%,
and I think that number's soft.

5
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,030
I'm tired of being a captain for
the gang that couldn't shoot straight.

6
00:00:21,273 --> 00:00:23,389
You ran great guns
in the campaign.

7
00:00:23,553 --> 00:00:27,990
Then you drove to the middle of
the road the moment you took the oath.

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:31,862
I wanted a Democrat,
and instead I got you.

9
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:35,503
Leo, there are times
when we are absolutely nowhere.

10
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:47,272
- It looks like it's gonna rain.
- It's overcast.

11
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,550
Isn't that usually
what it is before it rains?

12
00:00:50,713 --> 00:00:53,705
- But in this case?
- It's gonna rain later.

13
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:59,072
- If it rains, change the opening line.
- It's not gonna rain until maybe 2:00.

14
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:02,270
If you're wrong,
you gotta change the line.

15
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:04,628
This isn't from morning radio.

16
00:01:04,873 --> 00:01:07,785
This is from Lt. Emily
of the Coast Guard...

17
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:11,946
...who wouldn't let me down.
She has a very comforting voice.

18
00:01:12,713 --> 00:01:17,423
Here's my thing. If you're wrong,
if the Coast Guard is wrong...

19
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:22,144
...the remarks open with: "As I look
out over this magnificent vista."

20
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:28,104
If it gets moved indoors, he won't be
looking out over a vista of any kind.

21
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:33,029
You think he can't change it,
that he wouldn't know where he is?

22
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:34,547
This isn't major.

23
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:40,106
This is the United Organization
of Trout Fishermen. If it's moved--

24
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:43,231
I got it from the U.S. Coast Guard.

25
00:01:43,473 --> 00:01:47,022
They use satellites.
They use technology.

26
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:55,342
This is the same technology we use
to detect ballistic missiles, right?

27
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:57,231
Yeah.

28
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,862
- All right.
- We should move it inside.

29
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,308
Sam says it won't rain until later.

30
00:02:02,473 --> 00:02:05,271
Have you heard about
a paper going around?

31
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:07,583
- What paper?
- I don't know.

32
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,702
Dave Trillin asked what I knew
about a piece of paper going around.

33
00:02:12,913 --> 00:02:14,141
I haven't heard.

34
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:16,543
- You should find out.
- Good advice.

35
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:18,783
We're in the auditorium.

36
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:22,787
- Are they moving people inside?
- They moved 20 minutes ago.

37
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:25,308
The weather report called for rain.

38
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,748
- It did?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:31,349
Is it possible Lt. Emily
is yanking me around?

40
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:34,073
- Where's the president?
- How's his mood?

41
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:38,306
He had breakfast. He seemed upbeat,
energetic, optimistic.

42
00:02:38,473 --> 00:02:40,065
How long will that last?

43
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:45,705
Can we hurry so I can go preside
over a civilization gone to hell?

44
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:49,548
Nice talk. You know what this is?
Your mood, sir.

45
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:54,582
- Nothing wrong.
- It's your diet. You need roughage.

46
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:58,428
I'd like to beat you senseless
with a head of cabbage.

47
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:02,142
Your immaturity about
vegetables isn't presidential.

48
00:03:02,313 --> 00:03:05,146
- Who has my remarks?
- Sam's bringing them.

49
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:08,225
Is Toby on his way?
Why aren't they here now?

50
00:03:08,393 --> 00:03:10,668
They didn't know it was raining.

51
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:13,905
Nothing like surrounding yourself
with the best.

52
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:20,064
- Good morning.
- You didn't know it was raining?

53
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:24,067
To our credit, we knew it was raining
once it started.

54
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:27,828
- Here are your remarks.
- Who am I talking to now?

55
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:31,269
- An organization of trout fishermen.
- Seriously.

56
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,912
Give me the speech.

57
00:03:33,073 --> 00:03:35,382
There are anecdotes
about fishing.

58
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:38,465
- Have I ever been fishing?
- Probably not.

59
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:40,589
- Morning.
- What's going on?

60
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,472
The CBO is gonna
revise its projections...

61
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,466
...two FEC commissioners
resigned today...

62
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:50,546
- ...and the NGA endorsed trigger locks.
- How much?

63
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,671
The projections?
Maybe 200 billion.

64
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,621
Hang on.
Two FEC commissioners resigned?

65
00:03:57,793 --> 00:04:01,672
There are two seats open on the FEC?
This is interesting.

66
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,825
This is not the best time
for an idealistic--

67
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,230
Two seats just opened
on the election commission.

68
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:12,671
- The Senate leaders will fill them.
- What if we want our guys?

69
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,664
- We won't win.
- We can try.

70
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,346
It's not a good idea.

71
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:19,186
You're thinking about
changing democracy.

72
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,389
I'm talking about dangling our feet.

73
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,387
Get Leo two candidates who back
campaign finance reform.

74
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:27,748
I gotta stand with Leo on this.

75
00:04:27,993 --> 00:04:32,305
I'm not saying jump off the boat.
I'm saying dangle our feet.

76
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:34,906
- Mr. President?
- Yes?

77
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:38,827
- Somebody?
- United Organization of Trout Fishermen.

78
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:42,588
Is your head gonna be
in changing democracy?

79
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:46,302
No, I'm gonna be thinking
about trout fishermen.

80
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:49,192
- You felt better earlier.
- Try a year ago.

81
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:52,390
Does anybody know anything
about a paper?

82
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:56,307
- C.J., are you taller than usual?
- I'm my usual height.

83
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:59,192
Couldn't pick a trout out of a lineup.

84
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:04,711
- Two FEC seats open on the same day?
- Dream all you want. It won't happen.

85
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:08,149
That's what I thought,
but after your pep talk....

86
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,101
Thank you very much.
It's good to see you.

87
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:14,264
- Damn it!
- What?

88
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,071
I forgot to do something.

89
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:20,431
As I look out over this
magnificent vista....

90
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:07,506
How does the FEC work?

91
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:12,622
Commissioners are in for six years.
Two seats come up every two years.

92
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:16,149
Two just resigned?
How many times has that happened?

93
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:17,792
Including this? Once.

94
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:23,550
The president has the opportunity
to impact campaign finance reform?

95
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:25,749
- Do it, baby.
- It's not easy.

96
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:29,952
When a vacancy comes up,
the party leadership on both sides....

97
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:33,071
- Did you just call me "baby"?
- Yeah.

98
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:36,543
When a vacancy comes up,
the president fills it.

99
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:42,424
The party leadership on both sides
always dictates who to appoint.

100
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:47,462
One Republican, one Democrat.
That's how you keep the peace.

101
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:51,103
- You're gonna change it?
- No, but I'm gonna try.

102
00:06:51,273 --> 00:06:54,106
Come on,
you're trying to change democracy.

103
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,503
You're right.
I'll need a bagel.

104
00:06:56,673 --> 00:06:59,745
The Egg Hunt and the Egg Roll
are different.

105
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:03,826
This year's theme is "Learning is
Delightful and Delicious."

106
00:07:03,993 --> 00:07:06,063
As, by the way, am I.

107
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:09,623
The collection which will
be on display here...

108
00:07:09,793 --> 00:07:13,866
...features eggs decorated by artists
from each of the states.

109
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,991
This is coordinated
by the American Egg Board.

110
00:07:17,153 --> 00:07:22,307
I've hung with some of the Egg Board
cats, and they are party people.

111
00:07:22,553 --> 00:07:25,306
Thank you, that's it
till this afternoon.

112
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,144
- Steve? You got a second?
- Sure.

113
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:35,182
What have you heard
about a paper that's out there?

114
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:39,505
Same thing you've heard.
There's a piece of paper out there.

115
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,864
- If you hear anything, you'll tell me?
- If I do, I'll tell my editor.

116
00:07:45,033 --> 00:07:47,593
I keep forgetting
you don't work for me.

117
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,152
- See you.
- Bye.

118
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:52,271
There's a buzz
in the room, about a paper--

119
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,345
- Do you know anything?
- I know everything.

120
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:56,912
I wrote it.

121
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,312
What is it?

122
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:04,783
I wrote a memo for Russell,
outlining strategy--

123
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:09,583
- Excuse me, C.J.?
- Katie, they're in the Blue Room.

124
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:17,266
When I worked for Russell,
I wrote a memo...

125
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:20,982
...outlining the Bartlet
administration's weaknesses...

126
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:25,669
...and mapping out a strategy
to defeat him for renomination.

127
00:08:26,553 --> 00:08:30,910
C.J., this is embarrassing
and a little mortifying.

128
00:08:31,073 --> 00:08:33,064
But remember how mad I was--

129
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:36,509
You worked for us before,
and you work for us now.

130
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:41,030
- In between, you wrote how to beat us?
- I was working for Russell--

131
00:08:41,193 --> 00:08:44,822
I need to see a copy of it right now!

132
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:57,472
Margaret!

133
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,582
I can't e-mail.
What's the problem?

134
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:06,063
Lynette, from the Council
on Fitness, remember her?

135
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:11,546
She's the one where you say, "Who?"
And I say, "Lynette from Fitness."

136
00:09:13,073 --> 00:09:18,545
She sent me an e-mail about the number
of calories in our raisin muffins.

137
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:23,582
I forwarded it to several
hundred secretaries in the west wing.

138
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:28,232
Jolene Millman, in Political Liaison,
hit "reply," which--

139
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:31,032
Margaret, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have--

140
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:36,313
I hung in there, but you passed
the point when I stopped caring.

141
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:39,704
If you're curious,
it was around "raisin muffin."

142
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:44,551
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Fix the e-mail.

143
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:48,468
- Who'd you find?
- Bacon and Calhoun.

144
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,225
I know Bacon. Who else?

145
00:09:50,473 --> 00:09:55,183
Patty Calhoun's director of economic
studies at the Heritage Foundation.

146
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:57,548
She worked for two Republicans.

147
00:09:57,713 --> 00:10:01,023
- She favors campaign finance reform?
- Aggressively.

148
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:05,471
- The leadership will hate them both.
- What do you want me to do?

149
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:11,347
- Meet with the leadership offices.
- You want me to meet with the leaders?

150
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,983
No, meet their guys
outside the building, over a meal.

151
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:19,352
The president can't think we'll
get anywhere, can he?

152
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:23,788
The president doesn't think
we'll get anywhere, right?

153
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:25,181
No.

154
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:32,949
- What happened with the e-mail?
- Has to do with the Fitness Council.

155
00:10:39,113 --> 00:10:41,388
- Who'd you find?
- Bacon and Calhoun.

156
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:44,545
- Not in a million years.
- What are you doing?

157
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:47,273
It's our turn with the boys.
- Good luck.

158
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:49,947
Do you want me
to do the talking?

159
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:51,865
- Why?
- Just asking.

160
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:54,911
Morning. Morning.

161
00:10:55,073 --> 00:10:58,986
We all know each other.
Why don't we sit down?

162
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:02,668
We've been meeting
with various senior staff...

163
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:07,782
...on the DOD, NSC, and House
and Senate Armed Services.

164
00:11:07,953 --> 00:11:12,629
We feel a little hamstrung
because of the policy inherited...

165
00:11:12,793 --> 00:11:15,182
...regarding gays in the military...

166
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:21,223
...and we'd like input before making
recommendations to the president.

167
00:11:21,393 --> 00:11:24,032
- Can I interrupt for a moment?
- Sure.

168
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:26,991
What will come from
your recommendation?

169
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:31,624
Well, actually, it'll be
Sam's recommendation to the president.

170
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,829
I'm just helping out.

171
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,746
What do you think
will be the consequence?

172
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:42,226
Major, I would imagine
the consequences to be little.

173
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:45,146
I would imagine it to be very little.

174
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,669
If the president orders that gays
can serve openly...

175
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:54,305
...that's how it'll be. Anyone who
disobeys can stand court-martial.

176
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:57,545
The president can give
all the orders he wants.

177
00:11:57,713 --> 00:12:01,388
It takes an act of Congress
to amend the Uniform Code...

178
00:12:01,553 --> 00:12:04,704
...which makes sodomy
a crime. End of story.

179
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:11,943
- I guess it'll be a short meeting.
- Yeah.

180
00:12:14,673 --> 00:12:18,666
There will be 25,000 wooden eggs
and 7500 other eggs.

181
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,425
What are the other eggs?

182
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:22,663
- The other eggs are--
- Real eggs.

183
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,869
- Mandy's waiting.
- Where's Josh?

184
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:28,389
- FEC commissioners.
- Tell him I'd like to see him.

185
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:32,228
- 25,000 wooden eggs.
- Added to the 7500 eggs that are....

186
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,624
- They're just regular eggs.
- Right.

187
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:46,422
Is that it?

188
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:48,867
Yeah.

189
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:55,788
Who has it?

190
00:12:55,953 --> 00:12:57,272
I don't know.

191
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:00,347
But somebody does.

192
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,741
Yeah.

193
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:07,989
Okay. I'm gonna read it now.

194
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:13,467
Go back to your office
and don't answer any questions.

195
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:20,912
You'll call me
when you're done reading?

196
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:22,870
I'd count on it.

197
00:13:42,953 --> 00:13:47,026
Soft money renders the 1974
Campaign Reform Act toothless.

198
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:52,267
Soft-money contributions, which were
designed for party building...

199
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:56,984
...only eviscerate election controls.
We are, by definition, corrupt.

200
00:13:57,153 --> 00:14:01,908
- I wouldn't say that.
- No, but this money isn't 10s and 20s.

201
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:06,066
It's coming in in denominations
of 100, 200, 500,000 dollars!

202
00:14:06,233 --> 00:14:10,511
It comes from special interests
whose interests aren't the same...

203
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:15,986
...as those who don't have money. It's
going to issue ads and candidates.

204
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:17,985
It's called free speech.

205
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:21,862
If the insurance industry wants
to buy ad time, they can.

206
00:14:22,033 --> 00:14:26,345
If the airplane industry wants to back
a candidate, they can.

207
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:31,029
If big tobacco wants to wave a sign,
they are free to do so.

208
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:33,263
That's free speech, money isn't.

209
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:39,030
I like it when Josh comes here and
teaches us a lesson we richly deserve.

210
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:42,185
I came at the request of Leo McGarry.

211
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,826
The president is
strongly considering...

212
00:14:45,993 --> 00:14:50,669
...John Branford Bacon and
Patty Calhoun to fill the two seats.

213
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:53,268
We've already got our guys.

214
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:56,072
- It's Kalen.
- Grant Kalen and Joe Barkley.

215
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,384
People who oppose
any campaign finance reform.

216
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:04,471
I thought you liked Kalen.
He's elected Democrats from Indiana.

217
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:06,544
He's raised money in Indiana.

218
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:10,786
Barkley says people can
spend whatever they want on politics.

219
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,228
So does the Supreme Court.

220
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:17,944
We can't do this every time Bartlet
wants to make the world better.

221
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:22,265
The party leadership's gonna choose
a Republican and a Democrat.

222
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:26,904
That's the way it's been, the way
it's gonna be, and the way it is.

223
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,143
- Really?
- Yes.

224
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:33,625
- The president makes FEC appointments.
- The Senate confirms them.

225
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:36,182
I'm speaking for the majority leader.

226
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,584
Embarrass us, and we'll
give the same back to you.

227
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:43,223
Any legislation you want
off the table will show up.

228
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:49,105
Our greatest hits: 541, school prayer,
family support, entertainment decency.

229
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:54,506
- English as the national language.
- That will be our leadoff hitter.

230
00:15:54,673 --> 00:15:58,427
- Why not just not confirm our guys?
- We'll do that too.

231
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,472
In addition to voting down
our nominees...

232
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:05,705
...there will be retribution
for nominating them?

233
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:07,864
Yes. You know why?

234
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:12,470
Because you know you're gonna lose,
and we're gonna look bad winning.

235
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:16,706
I reject maintaining free speech
through government regulation.

236
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:18,784
- Reject what you want.
- What?

237
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,545
Reject whatever you want.

238
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,501
This was a fool's errand for me
and the president knew it.

239
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:28,825
This was a test balloon,
an "out of curiosity, what if" meeting.

240
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:32,952
- But you've got me on board.
- Steve, we've got a caucus.

241
00:16:33,113 --> 00:16:35,183
We gotta go.

242
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,304
- I'm going to lunch.
- The president won't eat his.

243
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,986
Why is he dissatisfied?

244
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:56,065
- It's entirely vegetables.
- It's a salad.

245
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:59,908
He'd prefer a sandwich.
Roast beef, pastrami, steak.

246
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:04,510
He will eat it, and if he doesn't
like it, he knows where to put it.

247
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:09,428
I don't think I will tell him that,
but I appreciate your help.

248
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:14,148
- If it ain't broke....
- "Don't ask, don't tell" works.

249
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:17,271
It doesn't. Want to know
how much it doesn't?

250
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:21,312
- 1145 gays were discharged in 1998.
- That's a record.

251
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,226
A 92% increase since
"don't ask, don't tell."

252
00:17:24,393 --> 00:17:27,863
414 Air Force discharges,
the highest in two decades.

253
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:32,629
271 of them during basic training
at Lackland Air Force Base.

254
00:17:32,793 --> 00:17:36,263
- What's going on there?
- I don't like your humor.

255
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,107
- I get that a lot.
- Sorry, I need Toby.

256
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,423
Yeah. Come here a sec.

257
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,911
You're doing good.

258
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,428
- What?
- I know what the paper is.

259
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,982
A strategy memo Mandy wrote.

260
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,269
- Strategy to do what?
- Beat us.

261
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:55,663
- Did you read it? Is it bad?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,710
Let's go to my office.

263
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,832
How'd it go?

264
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,065
- How do you know to be here?
- I see you out your office window.

265
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:13,306
- Why are you in my office?
- Looking for you out the window.

266
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:14,826
How'd it go?

267
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,190
- It went fine.
- Fine? You don't want to say more?

268
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:21,584
I don't, and you know I don't
because I'm not.

269
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:25,348
- This is our time together.
- I can't mess around.

270
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:29,426
I need to be prepped on
English as the national language.

271
00:18:29,593 --> 00:18:31,743
- Why?
- Might come up.

272
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,108
Because....
It doesn't matter.

273
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:39,222
If we do the FEC thing, English as
the national language is on the table.

274
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:41,429
Are we for it or against it?

275
00:18:41,593 --> 00:18:44,391
We don't favor another language,
do we?

276
00:18:44,553 --> 00:18:45,906
Dutch or something.

277
00:18:46,073 --> 00:18:48,826
Didn't I just tell you
I can't mess around?

278
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:54,266
- Bullet points? Give me 30 minutes.
- Thank you.

279
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,346
Toby said to come by
as soon as you got back.

280
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:10,622
I'm not taking any calls.
I'll call them back.

281
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:17,591
"The reality of the Bartlet
White House is a flood of mistakes.

282
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:20,984
An agenda stalled
and lacking a coherent strategy.

283
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:23,951
An administration
plagued by indecision."

284
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,104
- Ginger.
- What's going on?

285
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:34,143
Mandy wrote a manual for Russell,
and it's out. I don't know where.

286
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:35,632
How bad is it?

287
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,146
She takes us to town.

288
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:40,749
We don't look like rocket scientists,
but we're not.

289
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:44,548
- Who is it bad for?
- The president and Leo.

290
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:47,022
- Who has this?
- I'm finding out.

291
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,661
Do it quietly.

292
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:52,508
Quickly. Whose paper is it in
tomorrow? We have to know.

293
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:05,263
Our second year doesn't seem to be
going better than our first, does it?

294
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:07,062
No.

295
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:22,261
- Does he have a minute?
- He's finishing with the chairman.

296
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:25,106
They almost done?
I'll wait.

297
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,626
You having problems
with your e-mail?

298
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:38,511
Support says the pipeline's
been flooded.

299
00:20:38,673 --> 00:20:43,428
It happened when I forwarded an e-mail
to people and one tried to reply.

300
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:46,665
E-mail boxes are clogged.
Replies are...

301
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:52,271
...automatically bouncing
back and forth at subatomic speed.

302
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:57,227
I've passed the point
where you're interested, haven't I?

303
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,822
Yeah.

304
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,782
- Thank you, Fitz.
- Thank you.

305
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:05,103
- Good afternoon.
- You here for me?

306
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:08,151
Is the Philippines redundant?

307
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:12,545
- It is. That's the beauty of it.
- You'll have to convince him.

308
00:21:12,713 --> 00:21:14,590
- I will.
- If you say so.

309
00:21:14,753 --> 00:21:18,541
- Who are those guys?
- A meeting on gays in the military.

310
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:21,466
- Why?
- Sam's trying to build a position.

311
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:24,022
If he comes up with one,
let me know.

312
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:27,629
There may be a security breach
with the computers.

313
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:33,231
- White House computers aren't secure.
- That explains that.

314
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:42,668
- He wants to put A1-M1s in Manila.
- The president will say it's redundant.

315
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:46,223
- How much does it cost?
- Not much. 20 billion.

316
00:21:46,393 --> 00:21:49,385
- So there's gonna be a thing.
- About what?

317
00:21:49,553 --> 00:21:53,228
Mandy wrote a memo for Russell,
and someone's got it.

318
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,510
- Who?
- C.J.'s finding out.

319
00:21:56,673 --> 00:22:00,268
That's politics.
She was playing for the other guys.

320
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,469
Yeah.

321
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:07,066
There's some observations
the president won't be wild about.

322
00:22:07,353 --> 00:22:10,106
I move him to the middle.

323
00:22:10,273 --> 00:22:14,983
The sense is that he's aggressive
and you take him to safe ground.

324
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:18,985
Don't worry about it.

325
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:21,348
Don't worry about it.

326
00:22:21,513 --> 00:22:24,391
- Want to see a copy?
- No.

327
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:42,383
Six pages on English as the national
language. Stuff on James Madison--

328
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:46,512
James Madison? I didn't ask
for a damn social studies paper.

329
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:48,789
- Don't snap at me, Josh.
- Donna--

330
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:53,071
Look at the memo. I gave you
what you asked for. Don't snap.

331
00:22:55,393 --> 00:22:57,827
What's wrong with everyone today?

332
00:22:57,993 --> 00:23:00,746
It's been all day.
Is it Mandy's memo?

333
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,312
No.

334
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:08,350
Why is everyone walking around
like they've already lost?

335
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,551
I wasn't snapping at you.

336
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:14,422
I didn't realize that you
also gave me what I asked for.

337
00:23:14,913 --> 00:23:19,191
I thought you just
gave me James Madison.

338
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:23,268
Look at the James Madison.
It's gonna help you.

339
00:23:24,313 --> 00:23:25,826
Thanks.

340
00:23:30,113 --> 00:23:32,866
- How will Madison help you?
- I don't know.

341
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:36,990
The president
wants two reformers on the FEC.

342
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:41,431
Onorato will retaliate with
English as the national language.

343
00:23:41,593 --> 00:23:45,950
- The president won't look good.
- Tell me what else I should know.

344
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:49,264
The president won't look good
fighting that one.

345
00:23:49,433 --> 00:23:53,790
You oppose flag burning, school
prayer, gays in the military.

346
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:57,229
Say no to this,
and they'll paint a picture--

347
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:59,861
I understand, Mandy.

348
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,946
Fine. I'm just saying
it's my job to tell you that.

349
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:09,186
Today isn't the best day
for you to tell me what your job is.

350
00:24:09,353 --> 00:24:11,821
I wrote an op memo.
We've written 20!

351
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,702
- Ever hear of a burn bag?
- They got it off my hard disk.

352
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:19,912
Do you know who has it?
Then there's not much you can do.

353
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,626
Don't let the president
debate English--

354
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:30,391
It won't happen. The president won't
nominate who he wants to the FEC.

355
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:32,509
Why not?

356
00:24:35,913 --> 00:24:38,268
Because that's not what we do.

357
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,828
All right.

358
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:47,546
- I'll leave you alone.
- Thanks.

359
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:58,109
- Everyone's feeling this way today?
- Yeah.

360
00:24:58,273 --> 00:25:00,503
Okay. Thanks.

361
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:06,266
Hang on.
A lot of those cases--

362
00:25:06,433 --> 00:25:10,711
- This report, by the way--
- We can read. We know the report.

363
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:15,469
Lots of cases of gays being discharged
came from voluntary statements.

364
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:19,990
These aren't voluntary, not by any
definition given by a court.

365
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,906
It's not voluntary
if given to a therapist...

366
00:25:23,073 --> 00:25:25,746
...as in
Corporal David Blessing's case.

367
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:29,223
It is not voluntary
when it's in a personal diary...

368
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,668
...as in Nicole Garrison's case.

369
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:36,429
It's not when it's made when asked,
as in Officer Diane Kelli's case.

370
00:25:36,593 --> 00:25:40,302
And it is not when it is coerced
out through fear...

371
00:25:40,473 --> 00:25:43,704
...intimidation, death threats,
and prosecution...

372
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:50,028
...as in the case of Bob Kiddis, Kevin
Keys and four sailors on the <i>Essex.</i>

373
00:25:50,193 --> 00:25:52,548
We'll take care of our guys.

374
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:56,865
- Your guys are looking for jobs.
- Those weren't our guys.

375
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,910
- Oh, my God.
- Attention!

376
00:25:59,073 --> 00:26:01,348
- Good afternoon, Sam.
- Mr. Chairman.

377
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:04,986
- How do you do, admiral?
- Good to see you.

378
00:26:05,153 --> 00:26:06,711
We haven't met.

379
00:26:06,873 --> 00:26:08,829
From Oregon.
Percy Fitzwallace.

380
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:12,030
- It's an honor, admiral.
- I imagine it would be.

381
00:26:12,193 --> 00:26:14,468
This is Chairman Fitzwallace.

382
00:26:15,393 --> 00:26:19,227
They won't speak until I speak
to them. They're well-trained.

383
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,866
Stand easy.

384
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:25,151
- This Danish for anybody?
- Yes, sir.

385
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:28,032
We're discussing gays in the military?

386
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,389
What do you think?

387
00:26:31,953 --> 00:26:34,945
- I said, what do you think?
- We're here to help--

388
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:38,423
- I'm asking what you think.
- We're not prejudiced.

389
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:41,744
- You just don't want them serving.
- No, I don't.

390
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:45,303
They pose a threat
to discipline and cohesion.

391
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,145
That's what I think too.

392
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:52,023
The military wasn't designed
as an instrument of social change.

393
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,390
Problem is, they said that about me
50 years ago.

394
00:26:55,553 --> 00:27:00,991
Blacks shouldn't serve. It disrupts
the unit. Know what? It did.

395
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:03,428
The unit got over it and changed.

396
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:07,587
I'm an admiral and chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

397
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:09,744
Beat that with a stick.

398
00:27:09,913 --> 00:27:11,266
We'll see you, Ken.

399
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,552
Excuse me.

400
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:20,752
Mr. Chairman.

401
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,942
Just-- Thanks for stopping in.

402
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:27,627
You're not gonna get anywhere.

403
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:31,183
The president wanted
some exploratory meetings.

404
00:27:38,513 --> 00:27:42,142
- I was hoping to find you. I wanted--
- Hang on.

405
00:27:44,753 --> 00:27:47,347
- I wanted to ask--
- Hang on.

406
00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:59,909
- Is it the Magna Carta--?
- I'm finishing a thought.

407
00:28:02,793 --> 00:28:04,192
I'm finished.

408
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:09,149
You've heard there's a paper?
Know what it is?

409
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:13,226
- A strategy memo for Russell.
- That's right.

410
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:17,352
You gotta know I don't like
exploiting our friendship...

411
00:28:17,513 --> 00:28:21,984
...and I don't like taking advantage
of any feelings you have for me.

412
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,144
- You have them too.
- I don't.

413
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:30,032
I need to be ready for this.

414
00:28:30,993 --> 00:28:33,348
- Do you know who has it?
- Yes.

415
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,743
Who has it?

416
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:39,701
I do.

417
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:44,671
You have it?
You're gonna write about it?

418
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:46,869
- Sure.
- Why?

419
00:28:47,033 --> 00:28:49,308
- Because it's news.
- It's not news.

420
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:51,623
Just because it's entertaining!

421
00:28:51,793 --> 00:28:54,671
It's news. The president's
media director...

422
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,712
...wrote a memo to a party leader
describing his weaknesses.

423
00:28:58,873 --> 00:29:04,709
People in the party buy my paper.
They'd like to know what Mandy thinks.

424
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:09,993
- Mandy wasn't working here then.
- I don't care where she was working!

425
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:14,749
She's a key player, and she says
the president's vulnerable.

426
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:18,144
That may not be
good news for you, but it's news.

427
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,271
You asked us
to write about Easter eggs--

428
00:29:22,433 --> 00:29:25,550
Fine. We'll have a comment
for you by day's end.

429
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:28,432
- None of this is our fault!
- None of what?

430
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,868
Mandy's letter was pretty accurate.

431
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:34,105
She was working for Russell.
You knew why.

432
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,549
Why didn't you ask her,
"What are we doing wrong?"

433
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:42,343
Because you knew what she'd say.
There was nothing you could do.

434
00:29:42,513 --> 00:29:45,346
You guys are stuck in the mud
around here...

435
00:29:45,513 --> 00:29:48,266
...and none of it is the press' fault.

436
00:29:48,633 --> 00:29:50,510
I know you're frustrated.

437
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:55,110
But that's nothing compared
to the people who voted for you.

438
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:58,231
"We'll have a comment
for you by day's end"?

439
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:02,989
When I want the White House to
comment on a story, I'll ask for it.

440
00:30:05,713 --> 00:30:07,385
I have to do this work.

441
00:30:24,553 --> 00:30:29,547
- I'd like to go on record--
- There is no record.

442
00:30:29,713 --> 00:30:34,707
I have no objection to what somebody
does in their own home.

443
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:40,513
But when we're talking about schools
or Boy Scouts, we're talking about--

444
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:44,712
Why does being gay mean
you can't keep your hands to yourself?

445
00:30:44,873 --> 00:30:49,310
And how can the armed forces
lay claim to restraint in that area?

446
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:53,102
Want me to get the file
on sexual harassment in the DOD?

447
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,945
I've had enough of this.

448
00:30:55,113 --> 00:30:58,947
"Don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue"
is federal law.

449
00:30:59,113 --> 00:31:01,752
It takes an act of Congress to change.

450
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:05,110
If the president was serious
about changing it...

451
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:09,664
...he would not send you in here
with me and two junior DOD staffers.

452
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:14,509
He'd call his staff together and say,
"I want a resolution in the House.

453
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:18,905
I want 50 high-profile cosponsors.
I want a deal right now."

454
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:22,545
- Has the president done that?
- The president--

455
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,591
Has the president done that, Sam?

456
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,111
No.

457
00:31:29,273 --> 00:31:31,025
Okay, then.

458
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:35,425
Is this meeting anything more
than a waste of time?

459
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:40,465
No.

460
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,712
Okay, then.

461
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:53,988
I.T. Support is now accusing me
of being a hacker.

462
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:56,713
They're accusing me of smurfing.

463
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:01,185
They asked me if I was running
a Trojan horse. I said no.

464
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:06,222
I was simply telling people the raisin
muffin calorie count was wrong.

465
00:32:06,393 --> 00:32:11,023
You don't believe me, take one
of those muffins down to the lab.

466
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:13,431
- I'll do that.
- Will you?

467
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:20,667
Get me a muffin. Use gloves. Slip it
in a bag. I'll send it to the lab.

468
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:24,149
You're mocking me now,
aren't you?

469
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:25,382
Yes.

470
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:30,628
Come in.

471
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:36,465
Margaret thinks the FBI's
gonna bust in here any minute.

472
00:32:38,353 --> 00:32:41,106
Got a second bit of bad news
for you today.

473
00:32:41,273 --> 00:32:43,548
- You got new numbers?
- Yeah.

474
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:44,702
How bad is it?

475
00:32:44,873 --> 00:32:48,263
CNN/<i>USA Today</i> puts
our job approval at 42%.

476
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,141
We dropped five points.
In a week?

477
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:55,145
Unfavorables are higher
for the first time.

478
00:32:55,313 --> 00:33:00,387
54% of the country is likely to vote
for a Republican in November.

479
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:04,182
We dropped five points?
We didn't do anything last week.

480
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,991
I'll say.

481
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:11,549
Toby, when you start thinking about
jumping ship, you'll let me know?

482
00:33:11,713 --> 00:33:15,023
One victory in a year.
We got Mendoza on the court.

483
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:20,187
This president was elected with
48% of the vote. Without a mandate.

484
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:23,823
- The majority voted for somebody else.
- I don't care.

485
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:27,668
He was elected and sworn in.
I was there at the time.

486
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:31,826
It's not the easiest circumstance--
One victory isn't so bad.

487
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,905
One victory stinks
for an administration.

488
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:40,227
It's not the ones we lose that bother
me. It's the ones we don't try for.

489
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:45,032
And I'm not too crazy about you
questioning my loyalty.

490
00:33:50,713 --> 00:33:52,863
The president's reading the memo.

491
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,582
I wish you hadn't done that.
It's gonna piss him off.

492
00:33:56,753 --> 00:34:00,587
- It'll be in the paper tomorrow.
- Did you find out who has it?

493
00:34:00,753 --> 00:34:04,462
- Danny.
- And he's writing it?

494
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:08,626
- Right next to the poll numbers.
- How do we drop five points?

495
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:11,227
It happened.
Let's move on.

496
00:34:11,393 --> 00:34:14,829
I think the Senate
will confirm Bacon and Calhoun.

497
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:17,985
They'll have to.
Voters want campaign reform.

498
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:21,907
As punishment, their agenda
is to force the president...

499
00:34:22,073 --> 00:34:26,669
...to be unpopular on everything.
Like English as the national language.

500
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,745
We're not going
to let it on the table.

501
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:33,462
- We shouldn't be afraid--
- He won't let it on the table.

502
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:38,388
- Then we'll take their FEC candidates.
- As we always have.

503
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:41,863
- What about you?
- My meeting?

504
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:46,150
It was the same meeting
we've been having for--

505
00:34:46,713 --> 00:34:48,032
It was fine.

506
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,583
I'm sorry to interrupt.

507
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:16,748
- Who's got this?
- Danny Concanon.

508
00:35:17,193 --> 00:35:21,709
- Why am I finding out about this now?
- We learned about it today.

509
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:27,229
I really did wake up
energized this morning.

510
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:30,942
- I never go to bed that way.
- I know.

511
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:36,585
Just once I'd like to end a day
feeling as good as when it started.

512
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:40,187
- Are you bothered by this?
- The memo?

513
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:41,911
Yeah.

514
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:44,506
Yes.

515
00:35:44,713 --> 00:35:49,025
We've heard it before. You drive
me to safe ground. It's not true.

516
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:52,071
- I know it's not true.
- Good.

517
00:35:52,953 --> 00:35:55,183
You drive me there.

518
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,582
- What did you say?
- And you know it.

519
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,468
We're in neutral because
that's where you say to stay.

520
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,351
- You're wrong.
- I'm not.

521
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:10,025
You want to do this now?

522
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:14,869
You came to my house, Leo, and
you said, "Let's run for president."

523
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,022
I said, "Why?"

524
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:19,026
You said, "So you can say
what you think."

525
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:21,468
- Where'd that part go?
- You tell me.

526
00:36:21,633 --> 00:36:26,627
I don't see a shortage of microphones.
What the hell were you waiting for?

527
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:32,709
Everything you do says, "I don't
wanna be a one-term president."

528
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:36,548
- Didn't I say put our guys on the FEC?
- No, you did not.

529
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:39,352
No. You said,
"Let's dangle our feet...

530
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:45,748
...in the water like we do when
we want to look like we're trying."

531
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,473
That's a fascinating version
of history.

532
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:52,427
Take a look at Mandy's memo.
That's a fascinating version.

533
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:56,029
You brought me in
on teachers, on capital gains.

534
00:36:56,193 --> 00:36:58,946
You brought me in
on China and on guns.

535
00:36:59,113 --> 00:37:03,152
From where? You've never been
out there on guns or teachers.

536
00:37:03,313 --> 00:37:05,952
You dangle, and I'm the hall monitor.

537
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:09,423
It's my job to make sure
nobody goes off too far.

538
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:14,269
Josh goes to the Hill on campaign
finance, he knows nothing will happen.

539
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:19,712
Sam can't push "don't ask, don't tell"
and everyone knows that.

540
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:24,105
If I said to get aggressive on
finance or gays in the military...

541
00:37:24,273 --> 00:37:27,071
...you'd tell me, "Don't go too far."

542
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:29,508
If you said be aggressive, I'd say:

543
00:37:29,673 --> 00:37:32,824
"I serve at the pleasure
of the president."

544
00:37:32,993 --> 00:37:35,461
We'll never know,
because you won't--

545
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,342
- I have! Nothing happens!
- Want me to orchestrate this?

546
00:37:39,513 --> 00:37:44,633
You wanna see me mobilize these people
who would walk into fire for you?

547
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:49,264
These people who showed up to lead,
who showed up to fight.

548
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,470
He gets threats because
he dates your daughter.

549
00:37:52,633 --> 00:37:55,830
He was warned, "Don't show up.
You're in danger."

550
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,746
He said, "I'm going anyway."
You said no.

551
00:37:58,913 --> 00:38:03,509
Prudent or not prudent, this
21-year-old, at $600 a week, said:

552
00:38:03,673 --> 00:38:07,871
"I'm going where I want to,
because a man stands up."

553
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:13,350
Everyone's waiting for you.
I don't know how much longer.

554
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,792
I don't want
to feel like this anymore.

555
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:19,102
You don't have to.

556
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:24,431
- I don't wanna go to sleep like this.
- You don't have to.

557
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,106
I want to speak.

558
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:28,426
Say it to me.

559
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:33,310
It's more important than
re-election. I want to speak.

560
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:34,702
Say it again.

561
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:38,229
This is more important than
re-election. I want to speak now.

562
00:38:38,393 --> 00:38:40,065
Now we're in business.

563
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:44,590
We got our asses kicked,
but it's time to get up. Say it.

564
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:47,870
More important than re-election.
I want to speak now.

565
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,547
I'm gonna take the staff
off the leash.

566
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:55,025
You have a strategy for all this?
What is it?

567
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:56,945
I'm gonna try that for a while.

568
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:09,030
The ground game isn't working.
We're gonna put the ball in the air.

569
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:13,751
If we're gonna walk into walls,
I want us running into them.

570
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,028
What?

571
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:20,267
Tell the Hill the president's
named his nominees to the FEC.

572
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:25,421
We're gonna lose some battles.

573
00:39:25,593 --> 00:39:27,902
We might even lose the White House.

574
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:32,385
We won't be threatened by issues.
We'll put them front and center.

575
00:39:33,313 --> 00:39:37,192
We'll raise the level
of public debate in this country...

576
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:40,425
...and let that be our legacy.

577
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,663
That sound all right
to you, Josh?

578
00:39:45,433 --> 00:39:48,743
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

579
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:53,749
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

580
00:39:54,953 --> 00:39:58,423
I serve at the pleasure
of President Bartlet.

581
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:04,023
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

582
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:08,548
Good.

583
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,105
Let's get in the game.

584
00:41:17,913 --> 00:41:18,902
