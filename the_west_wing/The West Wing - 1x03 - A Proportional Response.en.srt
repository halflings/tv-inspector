1
00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:07,782
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,033 --> 00:00:10,501
I accidentally slept
with a prostitute.

3
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:11,788
Call girl.

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:13,187
- Accidentally?
- Yes.

5
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:15,225
Did you trip?

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:16,991
You're gonna try and reform her.

7
00:00:17,233 --> 00:00:20,350
The president
would like to keep you on.

8
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,424
- New media consultant?
- Absolutely.

9
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:23,822
- Not Mandy.
- Who?

10
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:25,392
Mandy.

11
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,582
What?

12
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:31,550
An Air Force transport
carrying Morris exploded in midair.

13
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:34,591
The order came through
Syrian defense.

14
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:38,303
I'll blow them away
with the fury of God's thunder.

15
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,149
C.J.'s looking for you.

16
00:00:58,393 --> 00:01:02,272
- "Good morning" is a good way to start.
- Good morning.

17
00:01:02,473 --> 00:01:05,749
- C.J.'s looking for you.
- Tell her I'm here.

18
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:08,188
C.J. is looking for you.

19
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:10,742
- What did I do?
- How would I know?

20
00:01:10,993 --> 00:01:12,824
- You know everything.
- I do.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,031
When I want to make
a substantive contribution--

22
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:18,025
You make plenty of them.

23
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:21,151
- Like what?
- This could be one.

24
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,304
- I need a raise.
- So do I.

25
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:25,908
- You're my boss.
- I don't pay you.

26
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:28,946
- You can recommend it.
- She's looking for me.

27
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:34,108
- You think it's a good time to talk?
- I think it's the best time.

28
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:37,589
- You're not a nice person.
- Gotta get to know me.

29
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:42,583
The best I can gather from what
I've overheard in the restroom...

30
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:45,148
...and at the Danish cart--

31
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:47,987
Is it possible there's a situation...

32
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,351
...involving Sam, a woman
and C.J. being denied information?

33
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:54,106
Here's what I'll do.

34
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:57,111
- Hide in your office?
- No, I'm not hiding.

35
00:01:57,313 --> 00:02:01,625
I'll go into my office and devise
a strategy. That's what I do.

36
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:05,422
- I'm a professional, not a child.
- That's the spirit.

37
00:02:05,673 --> 00:02:09,382
- If she calls, I'm at the dentist.
- Got it.

38
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:15,546
Wow, are you stupid!

39
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,585
You can't be mad at me.

40
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:06,984
Let's see if I can find it in me.

41
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:09,588
- She was here?
- Excuse us, Donna.

42
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:12,785
- I missed that?
- Kiss that raise goodbye.

43
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:15,706
- Senior staff in five minutes.
- Thanks.

44
00:03:16,673 --> 00:03:18,345
A call girl?

45
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:20,549
A call girl, Josh?

46
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:24,945
- Are you asking if I'd like one?
- Do you know how serious it is?

47
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:26,706
I don't think it is.

48
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,825
- Why not?
- A couple of things to remember:

49
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:32,109
He didn't know she was one.

50
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:35,225
He didn't pay her,
participate in, know of...

51
00:03:35,473 --> 00:03:40,308
...or witness anything illegal,
unethical, immoral or suspect.

52
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:45,223
A couple things for you.
None of that matters on <i>Hard Copy</i>!

53
00:03:45,473 --> 00:03:49,022
- You're overreacting.
- Am I? As women are prone to do?

54
00:03:49,273 --> 00:03:51,912
- That's not what I meant.
- It always is.

55
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:55,708
I think I'm the best judge
of what I mean...

56
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:58,905
...you paranoid Berkeley
shiksa feminista.

57
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:02,710
- That was way too far.
- No.

58
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,387
I've got a meeting and so do you...

59
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,510
...you elitist Harvard fascist...

60
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:11,183
...missed-the-Dean's-List-
two-semesters-in-a-row...

61
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,503
...Yankee jackass!

62
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,110
- Feel better with that off your chest?
- I'm a new woman.

63
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:21,587
- You look great.
- Don't try to make up.

64
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,903
- I'll talk to Sam.
- I will.

65
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:27,543
- Toby, how was last night?
- Longest dinner of my life.

66
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:31,388
The president was yelling
at Cashman and Berryhill...

67
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,308
...and at the secretary of state,
scaring Fitzwallace...

68
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:39,904
...snapping at the first lady,
talking about blowing up Africa--

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,150
Might be a good time
to tell him about Sam.

70
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:47,784
- She knows?
- I do. I'll be in to see you shortly.

71
00:04:47,993 --> 00:04:51,303
- How did I get into trouble?
- You got out of bed.

72
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:54,550
It's been three days.
This is amateur hour.

73
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:58,706
Cashman and Berryhill have to revise
the response scenario--

74
00:04:58,913 --> 00:05:02,701
They're dragging their feet
to make me look like a clown.

75
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:06,508
And state should be concerned
with what I tell them to be.

76
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:09,711
- Doesn't work like that.
- I've discovered.

77
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:13,144
The chiefs are moving
as swiftly as they can...

78
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:16,151
...even though, frankly,
time isn't a factor.

79
00:05:16,393 --> 00:05:21,308
And Cashman and Berryhill have a point
with respect to the Security Council.

80
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:24,266
Mrs. Landingham, I can't
find my glasses.

81
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:27,306
Please do what you do
when I can't find them.

82
00:05:27,513 --> 00:05:31,665
It's been 72 hours since they
blew him out of the sky.

83
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,707
I'm tired of waiting.
We'll draw up a response today.

84
00:05:35,913 --> 00:05:39,508
I'll give the order today.
We'll strike back today.

85
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,432
I wish you wouldn't say "him."

86
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,622
What?

87
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,307
"They blew 'him' out of the sky"?

88
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,347
It's fine when it's just us,
but in there with the chiefs...

89
00:05:50,553 --> 00:05:52,544
...say "it" or "the airplane."

90
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:55,512
You think I'm taking this personally?

91
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:57,146
Why shouldn't I?

92
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:01,864
- Since Morris was on the plane--
- Americans were on that plane!

93
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,702
I met Morris four or five times.
He wasn't my son.

94
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:07,505
We need to talk about--

95
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:09,311
I can't find my glasses!

96
00:06:09,553 --> 00:06:11,111
- We're on it.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:14,265
- The director's waiting.
- Let's have him.

98
00:06:14,553 --> 00:06:17,863
- What did you want to say?
- Nothing. I got staff.

99
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,223
- See you in an hour.
- Thank you.

100
00:06:23,953 --> 00:06:25,306
Good morning.

101
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:29,023
- How's his mood?
- His mood? Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:32,106
- Toby said--
- I said don't worry.

103
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:33,302
Sam, what do you know?

104
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,350
- It's true.
- You're kidding.

105
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:38,192
- I have the broadcast transcript.
- Broadcast?

106
00:06:38,393 --> 00:06:39,382
Listen.

107
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,306
Congressman Bertram Coles
on the radio.

108
00:06:42,513 --> 00:06:43,628
- Right.
- The fifth.

109
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,306
Eastchester County.

110
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,789
- Where we cut M-6 Beacon funding.
- And?

111
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,582
He was with officers from
Cromwell Air Force Base...

112
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,108
...when he said:

113
00:06:55,353 --> 00:07:00,632
"Folks here are fiercely patriotic.
The president better not plan a visit.

114
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:03,552
If he does, he may not get out alive."

115
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:05,431
- He said that?
- Believe it?

116
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:09,507
- Sitting with military officers?
- Don't take the bait.

117
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:12,625
- I will.
- Should be a law against it.

118
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:14,226
- There is!
- See?

119
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:18,102
Threatening a president's life.
Conspiracy.

120
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:22,306
How about treason? That was
a member of our own party!

121
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:27,029
- That was a Democrat who said that!
- It's bad, I know.

122
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:29,184
- That's it?
- What'll you do?

123
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:32,584
Bring him in for questioning,
pending charges.

124
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,826
Why be in power if you can't
haul your enemies in?

125
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:38,950
We're not gonna do anything?

126
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:42,105
Yeah, we need to arrest people
for being mean.

127
00:07:42,353 --> 00:07:44,628
There is no law, no decency.

128
00:07:44,873 --> 00:07:46,511
He's just getting that.

129
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:51,389
If an attack order's given, we'll
need a half-hour on the networks.

130
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:54,511
- When do we tell them?
- 90 minutes' notice.

131
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:56,146
Toby, start a draft.

132
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,226
- I need to know what we're hitting.
- Me too.

133
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,782
It's military.
You'll know when you know.

134
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:06,026
Sam, coordinate with the state
department guy and spokesperson.

135
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:08,741
- Let's do this right.
- No chance of that.

136
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:12,383
We need to get state department
officials, Pentagon--

137
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:14,311
- McMartin?
- Standing by.

138
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,788
- Adam Lee at the Pentagon.
- Got him.

139
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:19,672
How do we keep
what we know from them?

140
00:08:19,753 --> 00:08:21,505
We don't know anything.

141
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:26,668
- Sam, stop by my office around lunch.
- Sure.

142
00:08:26,913 --> 00:08:28,505
- Think she knows?
- Yeah.

143
00:08:28,713 --> 00:08:30,351
- Why?
- She told me.

144
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,312
- Could we talk?
- My office. I'll be back.

145
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,066
Hold on, stay there.

146
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:40,508
Did you guys hear what
Coles said on the radio?

147
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,742
- Yeah.
- And?

148
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:46,868
Secret Service investigates all
threats against the president.

149
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,902
Are you saying there will be
a criminal investigation?

150
00:08:51,993 --> 00:08:54,029
I can't comment on that.

151
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:56,468
I gotta get back to my office.

152
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:05,022
We'll say we don't think
we'd be disappointed...

153
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:08,390
...if no one paid attention
to the process.

154
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:12,023
- This is on agriculture?
- Science and technology.

155
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,906
We're done.

156
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:24,263
You wanted to see me.
I think I know why.

157
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:28,308
Do you? You sussed it out?

158
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,902
If you and I could figure it out...

159
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:35,231
...what makes you think no one
in my pressroom could?

160
00:09:35,473 --> 00:09:37,145
Nothing to figure out.

161
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,509
You'll get caught.

162
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,550
- Doing what?
- Don't get cute.

163
00:09:41,793 --> 00:09:44,591
I didn't know she was one
when we went home.

164
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:49,065
- But you called and went back.
- To see her. Not to solicit her.

165
00:09:49,273 --> 00:09:51,423
- No difference.
- There is!

166
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:55,552
You work in the White House and
you're consorting--

167
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:59,911
I like her.
She poses no threat to the president.

168
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:02,144
And owing to my friendship...

169
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:05,982
...she might start living inbounds,
insuring her future.

170
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:10,545
Isn't that what we're supposed
to be doing? This is ridiculous.

171
00:10:10,753 --> 00:10:13,904
- You're there to save her.
- Because I like her.

172
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,504
I'd be there for her if this were
alcohol. This isn't tawdry.

173
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:22,183
- I don't care what it is.
- I care what it is!

174
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:25,829
We should spend less time
looking good and more--

175
00:10:26,073 --> 00:10:28,587
Being good? I've heard that one.

176
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,744
- One other thing.
- Are we done?

177
00:10:30,993 --> 00:10:34,269
No, we're not done.
There's one other thing.

178
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:38,352
- I resent this.
- Tough to tell from your tone.

179
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:40,191
- What do you want?
- Sorry?

180
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,505
- What else?
- I'm your first phone call.

181
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:46,221
- When?
- Before, now, in the future.

182
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,583
Any time you're into something.

183
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:53,509
Don't say you thought it was nothing.
You sat with Josh and Toby.

184
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:57,063
When you're into something,
don't keep it from me.

185
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,503
I'm your first line of defense.

186
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:02,511
I have to protect you
and the president.

187
00:11:02,713 --> 00:11:07,628
- Is that what this is about?
- A high-profile, visible, noticed--

188
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:10,951
- Three things that mean the same thing.
- Let it go.

189
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:13,502
Can I go? I think it's about you.

190
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:15,908
Letting the character cops win...

191
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,941
...because you don't have
the guts, strength or courage...

192
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,627
...to say, "None of your business!"

193
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:23,942
- Really?
- Yes!

194
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:27,071
- Strength, guts or courage?
- Yes.

195
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:35,306
You just said three things
that all mean the same thing.

196
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:43,507
We're done talking now. You can go.

197
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:54,827
- In retaliation, will we target--?
- I don't know.

198
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:58,861
The commandant of the Second Division
doesn't include me.

199
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:03,150
- See you later.
- Count on it.

200
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,383
- Know what?
- What, admiral?

201
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:15,909
This is different coffee
than we usually have.

202
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,426
Keep your seats.

203
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,105
Morning, Mr. President.

204
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:26,305
- What have we got?
- Three strike scenarios.

205
00:12:26,553 --> 00:12:28,384
- Operational?
- At his command.

206
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,827
- No prep?
- No.

207
00:12:30,073 --> 00:12:33,702
All meet the obligations
of proportional response...

208
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:37,110
...and pose minimum risk
to U.S. personnel.

209
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:40,305
Scenario one, or "Pericles One,"
its code name--

210
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:43,909
What is the virtue
of a proportional response?

211
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,427
- I'm sorry?
- What's its virtue?

212
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,504
Why's it good?

213
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:55,391
They hit an airplane, we hit
a transmitter. That's proportional.

214
00:12:57,113 --> 00:12:58,102
In Pericles--

215
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:01,311
They hit a barracks,
we hit two transmitters.

216
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,903
- That's roughly it.
- This is what we do.

217
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,707
It's what we do and have always done.

218
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,025
If it is, don't they know we'll do it?

219
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:14,390
If you'll turn attention to Pericles--

220
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:18,387
I have. It's two ammo dumps,
an abandoned railroad bridge...

221
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,305
...an intelligence agency.

222
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:25,109
- Those are highly rated targets.
- But they know we'll do that.

223
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:29,989
They've been abandoned for three days.
We know that from the satellite.

224
00:13:30,193 --> 00:13:34,345
They did that, so we did this.
It's the cost. It's factored in.

225
00:13:34,913 --> 00:13:37,586
Am I right or am I missing something?

226
00:13:38,233 --> 00:13:39,427
You're right.

227
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:44,463
Then I ask again, what's the virtue
of a proportional response?

228
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:47,710
It isn't virtuous. It's all there is.

229
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,102
It isn't.

230
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:51,508
- Admiral Fitzwallace--
- Excuse me.

231
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:56,508
- Just what else is there?
- The disproportional response.

232
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:59,705
Let it ring forth
from this time and place...

233
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:03,992
...you kill any American,
we don't come back with proportion...

234
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,269
...but with total disaster!

235
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:09,785
Are you suggesting
we carpet-bomb Damascus?

236
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:13,429
I am suggesting you
and Fitzwallace and Hutchinson...

237
00:14:13,673 --> 00:14:15,823
...and the national security team...

238
00:14:16,073 --> 00:14:19,110
...take the next hour
and find a response...

239
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:24,228
...that doesn't make me think we're
just docking somebody's allowance!

240
00:14:41,753 --> 00:14:44,711
- I haven't eaten lunch yet.
- What do you want?

241
00:14:44,913 --> 00:14:49,225
I would like salad, soup
and if you run across a sandwich...

242
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,431
...hang the expense.
And a bottle of water.

243
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,986
This is Charles Young.

244
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,270
- I'm supposed to vet you.
- Beg your pardon?

245
00:14:57,473 --> 00:15:01,512
Investigate to discover
if there are problems.

246
00:15:01,753 --> 00:15:05,109
Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff.
Is it Charles?

247
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:08,743
- Have a seat if you like.
- I don't mind standing.

248
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,426
- Donna?
- What?

249
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,391
Never mind the salad.

250
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:15,784
- But I would like a bottle of water.
- Fine.

251
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:18,981
So have a seat.

252
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,909
You understand why we do this.

253
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:24,752
It's a very sensitive job.
And a hard job.

254
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:29,066
Twenty-hour days,
long trips at the last minute.

255
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:32,743
Sometimes you have to be
invisible in plain sight...

256
00:15:32,993 --> 00:15:36,622
...or a force against those
who want more time than we give.

257
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:41,105
Sometimes they'll be kings
and prime ministers. Understand?

258
00:15:41,353 --> 00:15:44,709
I think there's been
some kind of mistake.

259
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:45,942
Really?

260
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:50,146
- I came here, filled an application--
- I have your paperwork.

261
00:15:50,353 --> 00:15:54,232
Right. I was looking for a job
as a messenger.

262
00:15:54,473 --> 00:15:57,192
I interviewed with Miss DiLaguardia.

263
00:15:57,393 --> 00:15:58,985
She said to come here.

264
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:03,545
We ask her to keep an eye out.
She's recommended you for another job.

265
00:16:03,753 --> 00:16:04,742
If I may ask--?

266
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:09,305
- Personal aide to the president.
- I don't understand.

267
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:14,229
Personal aide. Traditionally
a young guy, 25 years old...

268
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:19,388
...strong academics, responsible,
discreet, presentable appearance.

269
00:16:19,593 --> 00:16:24,508
Many candidates have those.
The rest is just gut instinct.

270
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,789
Or you could bribe me.

271
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:28,902
Sir, l--

272
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,149
We call the president "sir."

273
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:34,590
Everyone else is,
"When do I get that thing?"

274
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,789
- It's a mistake.
- I'll say.

275
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:38,989
- Donna!
- I should go.

276
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,428
- "Insuccessful"?
- Yes?

277
00:16:41,673 --> 00:16:44,745
- We can't make up our own words.
- Not a typo?

278
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:48,502
Change it. Serious people
are gonna read that.

279
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:54,909
- You're standing again.
- I came for a messenger job.

280
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,502
Why aren't you in college?

281
00:16:58,353 --> 00:17:03,029
Your grades are better than mine.
Not really, but they're close.

282
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,184
It was an easy school.

283
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:10,188
Recommendations, ACT scores--
You didn't want to go to college?

284
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:12,429
I have a little sister.

285
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:14,709
- You take care of her?
- Yes.

286
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:16,471
Your parents are gone?

287
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:19,426
My mom, she's a police officer.

288
00:17:19,673 --> 00:17:23,712
She was shot and killed on duty
a few months ago.

289
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,304
Five months ago.

290
00:17:42,473 --> 00:17:44,111
Keep your seats.

291
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:49,508
A delegation of cardiologists
is having pictures taken upstairs.

292
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:53,911
You wouldn't think there's a group
more arrogant than us...

293
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:56,786
...but they're upstairs
in the Blue Room.

294
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,949
- You called me?
- Yes, sir.

295
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:03,505
We put together a scenario
by which we attack Hassan airport.

296
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:06,313
Three main terminals and two runways.

297
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:10,102
In addition to thousands
of civilian casualties...

298
00:18:10,313 --> 00:18:15,945
...we'd cripple the region's ability
to receive medical supplies and water.

299
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,747
Mr. Cashman and
Secretary Hutchinson...

300
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:22,190
...would each tell you
what you already know...

301
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,743
...that this would be seen
both at home and abroad...

302
00:18:25,993 --> 00:18:29,588
...as an overreaction
by a first-time Commander in Chief.

303
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:32,347
That without the support
of our allies...

304
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:35,704
...without Great Britain,
Japan and Congress...

305
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:39,707
...you'll have doled out
$5000 worth of punishment...

306
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:41,710
...for a 50-buck crime.

307
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:47,902
A proportional response doesn't empty
the options box for the future...

308
00:18:48,113 --> 00:18:50,946
...the way an all-out assault would--

309
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,512
Thank you.

310
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:59,905
Does anyone have a cigarette?

311
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:14,946
This other plan--

312
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:17,753
- Pericles One, sir?
- Pericles One.

313
00:19:17,993 --> 00:19:21,508
- No civilian casualties?
- We can't promise that.

314
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:25,428
- But you're as certain as you can be?
- Yes, sir.

315
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:27,504
The military implications?

316
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:32,025
We'll cripple intelligence and
surface-to-air strike capabilities.

317
00:19:32,273 --> 00:19:33,911
Very well.

318
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:46,189
How does this work?

319
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:48,503
You give me the go order, sir.

320
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:10,105
Mr. President?

321
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:26,183
This is Fitzwallace.
I have a go order.

322
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
Start the clock on Pericles One.

323
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:32,311
Stand by for confirmation code.

324
00:20:33,193 --> 00:20:34,706
We're underway.

325
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,350
Well done, Mr. President.

326
00:20:46,073 --> 00:20:48,109
"Fifty-buck crime"?

327
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:52,503
I honestly don't know
what the hell we're doing here.

328
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,785
I've got questions
from the council's office...

329
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:03,309
...from the Treasury
and from internal security.

330
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,344
They're routine. Ready?

331
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:10,343
- Ever try to overthrow the government?
- Is the messenger job unavailable?

332
00:21:10,593 --> 00:21:12,311
If I came back later--

333
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:16,870
This job's better. It pays more,
you don't ride on a bicycle...

334
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:21,112
...and instead, you'll be
personal aide to the president.

335
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,905
I see. So if I come--

336
00:21:23,113 --> 00:21:25,911
Sam Seaborn,
deputy communications director.

337
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:28,991
- Charlie's here for Ted's job.
- Don't get up.

338
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:32,589
- I'm here for the messenger job.
- Debbie's got an eye out.

339
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,223
- I've got my own bike--
- I gotta ask more questions--

340
00:21:36,473 --> 00:21:38,828
- Ever try to overthrow the government?
- No.

341
00:21:39,073 --> 00:21:41,587
- What's been stopping you?
- Seriously...

342
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,506
...I gotta ask
about your personal life.

343
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,904
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

344
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:50,991
- Why?
- Because I do.

345
00:21:51,513 --> 00:21:55,745
Will you come early, stay late
and do your job efficiently?

346
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:58,308
- As I was saying to--
- Thank you.

347
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:00,743
What more do you need to know?

348
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:04,349
What about your social life,
friends, what you do?

349
00:22:04,593 --> 00:22:06,311
I cannot believe you.

350
00:22:06,513 --> 00:22:08,981
Well, there's my sister, Deanna--

351
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,508
I'm not sure what you're asking.

352
00:22:11,713 --> 00:22:14,830
He's asking if you're gay.
I wouldn't answer.

353
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:16,711
Let's take a walk.

354
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:20,872
- Feel free to sue. I'll represent you.
- Let's go.

355
00:22:22,353 --> 00:22:23,627
What was that?

356
00:22:23,873 --> 00:22:25,750
- This is ridiculous.
- It's not.

357
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:27,506
I know right and wrong.

358
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:30,904
You knew you'd be held
to a higher standard here.

359
00:22:31,153 --> 00:22:33,508
I mind being held to a lower one.

360
00:22:33,713 --> 00:22:36,181
- Digging your heels--
- You're talking?

361
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:39,505
Digging my heels?
Another word for "principle."

362
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:43,626
- I'm just saying--!
- Leo's office. It's happening.

363
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,746
He's right here.

364
00:22:45,953 --> 00:22:47,989
- It's happening?
- That's right.

365
00:22:48,193 --> 00:22:51,822
The order was given at 1627,
code name Pericles One.

366
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,506
Four military targets.

367
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:57,348
Two munitions dumps in North Rashan,
Saffian bridge and I.H.Q.

368
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,629
- Estimated time?
- 6:30 Eastern.

369
00:22:59,873 --> 00:23:02,512
Briefing in the Sit Room
in 20 minutes.

370
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:04,630
In the meantime, Toby, Sam...

371
00:23:04,873 --> 00:23:08,752
...the president will go on network
at 9. Start zeroing in.

372
00:23:08,993 --> 00:23:10,551
No phone calls in or out.

373
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:13,910
C.J., nothing to the press
until I say.

374
00:23:14,113 --> 00:23:17,901
- They'll wonder about the fuss.
- Let's not have any.

375
00:23:18,153 --> 00:23:20,986
- I need time with the president.
- Me too.

376
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,832
- This is the first--
- He'll be there.

377
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:26,507
- He'll talk to me?
- Yes.

378
00:23:31,873 --> 00:23:33,704
How you doing?

379
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,032
Fine.

380
00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:40,752
- Toby says he's snapping at--
- Not now, Josh.

381
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,023
You're right, but not now.

382
00:23:43,273 --> 00:23:44,752
Margaret!

383
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,545
- Can I ask you a question?
- What?

384
00:23:48,753 --> 00:23:52,541
I'm interviewing a kid for Ted's job
and he's special.

385
00:23:52,793 --> 00:23:56,263
Good in school and articulate
if he wasn't terrified.

386
00:23:56,473 --> 00:24:00,022
He's postponing college
till his sister's out of high school.

387
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,663
- Parents?
- Father's gone. Mother was a cop.

388
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:08,503
- Was?
- Shot and killed five months ago.

389
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,263
I like him. I want to hire him.

390
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:15,664
- What's the problem?
- He's black.

391
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,943
So is the attorney general.

392
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:22,345
He doesn't hold the door
for the president. It's the visual.

393
00:24:22,593 --> 00:24:25,153
A young black man holding his bag?

394
00:24:25,393 --> 00:24:29,864
I hold the door for him.
It's an honor. This isn't casting.

395
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:33,429
We get the guy for the job,
and we take it from there.

396
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:37,905
- And I'm fairly sure I'm right.
- Yeah, good.

397
00:24:39,233 --> 00:24:41,622
- Two hours.
- A little less.

398
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:45,502
- Leo, Chairman Fitzwallace.
- Send him in.

399
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:48,708
- We'll be fine.
- Yeah.

400
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,832
Things have moved
since I was here last.

401
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:56,351
- How are you? Josh Lyman.
- You don't have to introduce yourself.

402
00:24:56,593 --> 00:24:57,582
Tough day.

403
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,712
- It'll be tougher on them than on us.
- Good.

404
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:06,070
- You're gonna have to sit him down.
- I know.

405
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,503
He has to talk to the country.

406
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:12,786
This isn't the last one we'll have
to do. But sit him down.

407
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:15,388
- Any advice?
- It's not my place.

408
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:17,385
Yeah, it is.

409
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:22,184
Tell him it's always like this
the first time and he's doing fine.

410
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,264
- He's not.
- Yeah, he is.

411
00:25:24,473 --> 00:25:27,909
Presidents don't make new friends.

412
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,785
You'll know what to say.

413
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,342
Yeah. Hey, Fitz!

414
00:25:32,953 --> 00:25:35,342
The president's personal aide.

415
00:25:35,593 --> 00:25:38,903
Any problem with a young black man
waiting on him?

416
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:43,743
- I'm an old black man and I do that.
- He's got to carry his bags--

417
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:46,143
You gonna pay him a decent wage?

418
00:25:46,393 --> 00:25:48,623
You gonna treat him with respect?

419
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:51,228
- Then why should I care?
- Right.

420
00:25:51,473 --> 00:25:55,625
I've got real battles.
I don't have time for cosmetic ones.

421
00:25:56,073 --> 00:25:59,509
- Thanks, admiral. Good luck.
- See you later.

422
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:03,510
- Evening, Toby.
- I can't stop--

423
00:26:03,753 --> 00:26:04,742
Go.

424
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:07,461
- Estimated BDA?
- I don't know!

425
00:26:07,673 --> 00:26:08,992
- You need help?
- No.

426
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,542
Sheila, if you need me...

427
00:26:11,793 --> 00:26:15,502
...I'm standing here
with absolutely nothing to do.

428
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:17,911
White House communications.

429
00:26:18,153 --> 00:26:21,384
Toby's not available
to speak on the phone.

430
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,703
No, Sam's not available either.

431
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:27,428
- Why aren't they?
- They're planning my surprise party.

432
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,227
- Unprovoked and cold-blooded.
- A third?

433
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:32,509
- Quickly.
- The AGM-84E SLAM.

434
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:36,348
- Sam cut the paragraph 10 minutes ago!
- Coming out!

435
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,465
- 84E SLAM?
- Standoff land attack missile.

436
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:43,905
Distinguish it from the Harpoon,
an anti-ship missile.

437
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,502
- The third?
- Unwarranted, unprovoked.

438
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:49,750
- Unwarranted, cold-blooded--
- Unprovoked.

439
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:52,592
- Where are you--?
- Two seconds.

440
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,710
- I'm sorry about before.
- Yeah.

441
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,626
I'm just very fond of her is all.

442
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,511
Go back to work.

443
00:27:05,753 --> 00:27:07,106
Right.

444
00:27:13,553 --> 00:27:15,828
- What's all the activity?
- What?

445
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,183
Fitzwallace was in Leo's office.

446
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:22,784
Fitzwallace is chairman, Leo's chief
of staff, I'm your host. Let's play.

447
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:25,103
Is it happening? Would you know?

448
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:28,151
- Why the activity?
- Menudo's here. Gotta go.

449
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:30,304
I'd think you of all people--

450
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:33,505
- We need to talk.
- I haven't called a full lid.

451
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:37,223
There'll be a briefing
if we've engaged the military.

452
00:27:37,473 --> 00:27:42,308
I've only been a White House reporter
for seven years, so I know.

453
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:44,911
What?

454
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,226
Not for nothing...

455
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:52,988
...but Sam's been going
with a $3000 call girl.

456
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:55,906
I thought you should know that I know.

457
00:27:56,753 --> 00:28:00,109
- Ask me inside.
- Inside.

458
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,621
Where's Charlie?

459
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:20,989
Filling out employment stuff.

460
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,701
- How's he doing?
- He looked freaked.

461
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,912
- He's a gamer. I can pick them.
- If you say so.

462
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,910
I have nothing to do.

463
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,109
I can see.

464
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,107
Excuse me.

465
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:45,511
Everyone running like the world
depends on it. Which it does.

466
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:50,110
Everyone's running around, working.
Me, I've got nothing to do.

467
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,542
Like a writer on a movie set.

468
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:56,307
Have you ever been on a movie set?

469
00:28:56,553 --> 00:28:58,908
No, but I hear stories.

470
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,711
Want to do mail?

471
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:05,549
At least we know that whatever
happens today has already happened.

472
00:29:05,793 --> 00:29:08,705
Josh, your office sucks.

473
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:12,702
Why can't you tell me
there's a person in my office?

474
00:29:12,953 --> 00:29:17,424
The first time I didn't know.
The second, I didn't care that much.

475
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:20,307
I mean it, it's a hole.

476
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,385
Why are you here?

477
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:25,431
I start next week.
I came to get psyched.

478
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:27,903
You picked a bad time.

479
00:29:28,113 --> 00:29:30,946
Because of the attack
and you going on air?

480
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:32,421
No, it's because--

481
00:29:32,673 --> 00:29:34,584
Everyone's looking casual.

482
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:38,826
Toby and Sam are with the writers
and you have nothing to do.

483
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,785
Is it a couple of armories?

484
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:44,150
Louder. Syrian Air Defense
didn't hear you.

485
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:47,505
- I got you a present.
- Why are you being nice?

486
00:29:47,713 --> 00:29:49,704
I'm excited about work.

487
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:53,144
- It's been bad since it happened.
- I had a hunch.

488
00:29:53,393 --> 00:29:56,191
The combination of
American lives and Morris.

489
00:29:56,393 --> 00:29:59,942
- The idea of using force--
- We knew he'd be in his head.

490
00:30:00,153 --> 00:30:03,304
- He wasn't ready for it.
- How do you get ready?

491
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,549
- What did you bring me?
- What?

492
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:08,512
- I want my present.
- Oh, yeah.

493
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,750
It's a picture I found.

494
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:17,512
It's you and me, and someone's
drawn on my face with a marker.

495
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:20,830
That was me. During my period
of hating you.

496
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:23,507
That could have been any time.

497
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:27,826
This was taken the night we met.
At the seafood place.

498
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:29,904
Look at that.

499
00:30:30,153 --> 00:30:34,112
- You stared at me.
- You were wearing quite the ensemble.

500
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:38,107
I don't think it was the wardrobe
you were looking at.

501
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,506
You guys are doing okay, Josh.

502
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:46,307
Yeah?

503
00:30:47,873 --> 00:30:49,101
Yeah.

504
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:53,029
- They found a job for me.
- See you next week.

505
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:57,824
- Will you be nice when we're working?
- Not a chance.

506
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,103
That's what I thought.

507
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:06,312
What's up?

508
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,389
I don't have enough for a story...

509
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:12,705
...but I wanted you to know
I'll be asking around.

510
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:15,990
- It's nothing.
- Doesn't look that way.

511
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:19,589
I just got through telling you
it's that way.

512
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,551
Sam knows right and wrong.

513
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:24,705
It would be easier
if they weren't friends.

514
00:31:24,953 --> 00:31:29,629
But I don't choose his friends and
your readers don't get to judge them.

515
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:33,422
And there's something commendable
about Sam's behavior.

516
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:35,311
And I'm sticking by him.

517
00:31:35,553 --> 00:31:39,785
And I'll look unfavorably on those
who make us look like fools.

518
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,785
- I'll drop it.
- Thank you.

519
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:46,709
But not everyone's a good guy.
You'll start to get traction...

520
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:50,110
...on something
someone's not a fan of...

521
00:31:50,353 --> 00:31:53,743
...and they'll put a tail on him.
I found out.

522
00:31:53,993 --> 00:31:56,302
- I don't suppose you'd tell--
- No way.

523
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:59,192
But they'll keep it
until something big.

524
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:03,312
Bill signing, State of the Union,
maybe the convention.

525
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:05,783
Yeah. I'll wait for him.

526
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:07,944
I'm giving you a head start.

527
00:32:08,193 --> 00:32:10,024
- What for?
- Being a good guy.

528
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:11,911
What's the tip?

529
00:32:12,153 --> 00:32:14,109
Yeah, thank you.

530
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:16,749
We're out of Syrian airspace.

531
00:32:17,113 --> 00:32:21,629
This was the council's office till
the communications staff conquered.

532
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:23,545
Map Room, Roosevelt Room.

533
00:32:23,793 --> 00:32:25,829
Oval Office, chief of staff.

534
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:29,145
Only thing left is to
say hello to the president.

535
00:32:29,393 --> 00:32:32,351
We're going on the air soon
so I don't know--

536
00:32:32,593 --> 00:32:34,504
Where the hell did he go?

537
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:35,942
Charlie.

538
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,753
- Where's paragraph nine?
- In the red line.

539
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,302
- Sorry, paragraph eight.
- We cut that.

540
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,743
- I want it.
- If you look--

541
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:48,103
I can't look at anything.

542
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:51,584
- I need my glasses!
- She's talking to the porters.

543
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:53,226
When's the BDA?

544
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,191
- There's a problem.
- Why?

545
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:58,908
Ordinarily, we get info
from inside Syrian intelligence.

546
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:02,708
- So?
- We just blew up Syrian intelligence.

547
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:06,906
Somebody call CNN and find out
if we hit anything!

548
00:33:07,113 --> 00:33:08,182
It's the BDA.

549
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,311
Thank you! Now if I had my glasses!

550
00:33:12,793 --> 00:33:14,385
They've searched your room--

551
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:17,511
We could've brought in an optometrist!

552
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:21,308
They can't fold their equipment
into a briefcase.

553
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:25,222
I don't need one now.
I need the glasses he prescribed!

554
00:33:25,473 --> 00:33:28,624
If you'll familiarize yourself
with the Phoenix--

555
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,502
- I have.
- I'm not talking about the Sidewinder.

556
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:35,511
I got the briefing on it last night.

557
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,465
Hutchinson was in my study.

558
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:42,030
The Phoenix, the Sparrow,
and the Sidewinder. Are we covered?

559
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,547
Ten minutes to air.

560
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:46,102
- For want of glasses!
- Try mine.

561
00:33:46,673 --> 00:33:48,948
- Tell him.
- We're looking.

562
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:54,628
- Meantime, look at the new para--
- I can't see anything!

563
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,347
- Tell him.
- Mr. President?

564
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:04,106
- You said you read the report--
- What?

565
00:34:04,313 --> 00:34:08,101
You said you read the report
in your study last night.

566
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,905
What of it? Who is this?

567
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:14,908
Have a steward go to the study,
and look on the coffee table.

568
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:19,550
- Mr. President, this is Charles--
- I don't have time for new people!

569
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,705
All right, that's it.

570
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:26,424
Excuse me, Mr. President.
A minute, please?

571
00:34:37,473 --> 00:34:39,304
What do you need?

572
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,622
You've gone through all your workers
and your wife.

573
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:48,429
I was afraid you'd get mad
at the American people next.

574
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:53,303
By the way, when we're done here,
you're sending Abbey some flowers.

575
00:35:01,793 --> 00:35:03,704
Did you know, 2000 years ago...

576
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:07,542
...a Roman citizen could walk
across the known world...

577
00:35:07,793 --> 00:35:10,227
...free of the fear of molestation?

578
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:12,703
He could walk across unharmed...

579
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:16,110
...protected by the words
<i>"Civis Romanus."</i>

580
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,110
"I am a Roman citizen."

581
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:22,904
So great was the retribution of Rome
universally understood...

582
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:26,947
...should any harm befall
even one of its citizens.

583
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:31,232
Where was Morris' protection,
or anybody else on that plane?

584
00:35:31,473 --> 00:35:35,512
Where's the retribution for the
families? The warning to the world...

585
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,704
...that Americans
shall walk unharmed...

586
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:42,424
...lest the fist of the most mighty
military force in history...

587
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,629
...comes crashing down on you.

588
00:35:44,873 --> 00:35:47,307
In other words, what are we doing?

589
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:52,388
- Behaving as a superpower ought to.
- It's produced crappy results!

590
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:56,945
- I'm not sure it hasn't induced it!
- What are you talking about?

591
00:35:57,193 --> 00:35:59,832
I'm talking about 286 Marines
in Beirut!

592
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:01,984
About Somalia! About Nairobi!

593
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:05,305
You think adding
to the body count is a deterrent?

594
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:09,108
That's as stupid as
thinking capital punishment...

595
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,463
...is a deterrent for drug kingpins!

596
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:16,110
As if they didn't live daily
under the possibility of execution.

597
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:19,026
And their executions are less dainty.

598
00:36:19,273 --> 00:36:23,425
And take place without the bother
and expense of due process.

599
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:27,632
So if you want to start using
American military strength...

600
00:36:27,873 --> 00:36:31,104
...as the arm of the Lord...

601
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,031
...you can do that.

602
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:35,945
We're the only superpower left.

603
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:40,186
You can conquer the world
like Charlemagne.

604
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:43,743
But you better be prepared
to kill everyone.

605
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:48,708
And start with me because
I will raise up an army against you...

606
00:36:48,953 --> 00:36:51,103
...and I will beat you!

607
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:55,501
- He had a 10-day-old baby.
- I know.

608
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,987
We're doing nothing.

609
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,828
We are not!
Four high-rated military targets.

610
00:37:01,073 --> 00:37:03,587
- And this is good?
- There is no good!

611
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:04,987
It's what there is.

612
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:07,952
It's how the most powerful nation
behaves.

613
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:11,708
It's proportional, reasonable,
responsible, merciful.

614
00:37:11,953 --> 00:37:14,706
It's not nothing.
Four military targets.

615
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:18,502
- Which they'll rebuild!
- We'll blow them up again!

616
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,506
We're getting really good at it.

617
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,910
It's what our fathers taught us.

618
00:37:34,793 --> 00:37:37,148
Why didn't you say so?

619
00:37:38,753 --> 00:37:40,903
Oh, man.

620
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:45,988
When I think of all the work
you put in to get me to run...

621
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:49,509
...of all the work you did
to get me elected...

622
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:53,308
...I could pummel your ass
with a baseball bat.

623
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,304
Here's one you'll like.

624
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:09,031
- Bertram Coles--
- I like anything starting with that.

625
00:38:09,273 --> 00:38:11,423
Coles goes on the radio and says...

626
00:38:11,673 --> 00:38:14,187
...people in his district
love America...

627
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:18,904
...and you better not come down
because you might not get out alive.

628
00:38:19,113 --> 00:38:21,581
- Bert's calling me out?
- Apparently.

629
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,984
The people in his district
are so patriotic...

630
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:29,431
...that if the president of the
United States were to show up...

631
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:31,265
...they'd kill him.

632
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:35,902
- Ziegler must be ballistic!
- Toby is on it.

633
00:38:38,033 --> 00:38:41,946
Who was that kid who figured out
where my glasses were?

634
00:38:42,193 --> 00:38:45,390
If you want him,
that's your new body man.

635
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:47,271
What's his story?

636
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,348
What's going on in there?

637
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:56,311
I don't know.

638
00:38:57,033 --> 00:39:00,946
Do you know about the Secret Service
investigating Coles...

639
00:39:01,153 --> 00:39:03,542
...for threatening the president?

640
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:04,942
No.

641
00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,423
Greenwald is quoting you as saying...

642
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:12,383
...they investigate all threats
made against the president.

643
00:39:12,953 --> 00:39:14,181
Yeah.

644
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:17,505
- Did you say that?
- Yeah.

645
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,628
You don't suppose that's
how the story got started?

646
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:26,503
You tell Coles, Toby Ziegler said
there's a new sheriff in town.

647
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:34,027
This was just, I think, a bad day.

648
00:39:34,273 --> 00:39:39,142
He's ordinarily an extremely kind man,
placing a high premium on civility.

649
00:39:39,393 --> 00:39:43,181
It's just been a difficult
few days for him.

650
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:45,025
I should probably go.

651
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:48,583
Excuse me, Charlie.
Can I see you inside, please?

652
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,505
Come on, it's okay.

653
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:53,189
- I'm Jed Bartlet.
- Charles Young.

654
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:56,942
You prefer Charlie.
Leo filled me in about your mother.

655
00:39:57,193 --> 00:40:01,789
I hope you don't mind but I called
Tom Connolly, the FBI director--

656
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,944
We got some quick information.

657
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,106
Your mother was killed
by a .38 revolver firing KTWs...

658
00:40:08,313 --> 00:40:09,905
...or "cop-killer" bullets.

659
00:40:10,113 --> 00:40:12,343
We have not had success yet...

660
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:15,511
...in banning those bullets
off the streets.

661
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:19,951
We plan a whack at it
when Congress comes back from recess.

662
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:23,503
What do you say?
You want to come help us out?

663
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,713
- Yes, sir, I do.
- Thanks, Charlie.

664
00:40:27,673 --> 00:40:28,901
Thirty seconds!

665
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:32,190
- All set?
- You tell me.

666
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,028
- That's an ugly tie.
- My granddaughter gave me this.

667
00:40:36,273 --> 00:40:38,150
My nephew gave me an ashtray.

668
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,032
Somebody throw him
out of the building!

669
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:42,342
Stand by.

670
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,507
Thank you.

671
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:54,424
- I've never felt like this.
- It doesn't go away.

672
00:40:54,673 --> 00:40:56,709
<i>Here, now, the president.</i>

673
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,631
My fellow Americans.

674
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,512
A short while ago,
I ordered our forces...

675
00:41:01,713 --> 00:41:04,750
...to destroy military targets
in Syria...

676
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:07,791
...in response to the
unwarranted, unprovoked...

677
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,910
...and cold-blooded downing...

678
00:41:10,113 --> 00:41:12,024
...of an unarmed Air Force jet...

679
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:15,709
...carrying 58 passengers
and the flag of the United States.
