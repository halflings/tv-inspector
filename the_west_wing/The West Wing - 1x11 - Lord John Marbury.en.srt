1
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:08,406
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:13,243
- Lillienfield knows Leo was a drunk.
- Everyone knows that.

3
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:16,365
They don't know there were pills.

4
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:18,569
He was in rehab.
Six years ago.

5
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:20,889
A pleasure, ma'am.
Charlie Young.

6
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:23,163
Don't call her "ma'am."

7
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:25,682
- Zoey?
- If I can call you Charlie.

8
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,690
Take me out, convince me.

9
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,884
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

10
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:32,653
- I was distracted.
- I won't say it again.

11
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:35,572
Then I'm gonna assume
you asked me out.

12
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,251
Jack.

13
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,489
- Last pass with the KH satellite.
- How old is this?

14
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:56,129
- About 20 minutes.
- Go to X-10 inside the grid.

15
00:01:00,413 --> 00:01:03,928
Those are two CVEs
and four destroyers.

16
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,725
Let's get some help.

17
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:14,081
We can identify the northern,
central, and western armies.

18
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:17,285
They all appear to be
front-line divisions.

19
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,803
- What about the Navy?
- Two CVEs, four destroyers.

20
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:23,203
- Where are they headed?
- Pakistan.

21
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:27,804
- I'm sold. Let's brief the C.O.s.
- I'll call the White House.

22
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,406
- You'll like it.
- It doesn't sound like it.

23
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:36,401
- Caddying? It's great.
- I just lug your golf clubs around?

24
00:01:36,613 --> 00:01:40,208
- It's good exercise.
- Of course. I'm lugging golf clubs.

25
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:44,167
You'll be reading the greens,
helping with club selection.

26
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:45,601
- Here he is.
- Me?

27
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,566
Joshua Lyman?
Are you Joshua Lyman?

28
00:01:48,773 --> 00:01:49,967
Claypool again?

29
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:53,483
- This is a subpoena--
- Why do you let him in?

30
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:58,130
- If you'll sign to show proof--
- Give me it. It's like the 43rd time.

31
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:02,212
This is Freedom Watch, right?
You guys are real patriots.

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:07,692
- Hope this hasn't inconvenienced you.
- Why would that inconvenience me?

33
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:11,169
- Have a good day, sir.
- Thank you. Drop dead.

34
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,683
It's what I do.
I'm a professional hostile witness.

35
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:17,009
- Will I drive the cart?
- No cart.

36
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,728
- You don't use a cart?
- Real golfers don't use carts.

37
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,163
- Don't they carry their clubs?
- No.

38
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:26,046
Would you pay me?
You play in the winter?

39
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:30,565
Spring, but I want you
to start practicing right away.

40
00:02:30,773 --> 00:02:32,923
- Good evening.
- How are you, Josh?

41
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:37,251
- I've been subpoenaed.
- I'm sorry. Want a cookie?

42
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,886
- The president asked me to come by.
- He just left with Leo.

43
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,607
- Where'd they go?
- Situation room.

44
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,691
Keep your seats.

45
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,812
Admiral Fitzwallace?

46
00:02:58,493 --> 00:03:04,648
25 minutes ago, the Indian Army
invaded along the cease-fire line...

47
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:07,447
...into Pakistan-held
Kashmir territory.

48
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:11,931
- Is India's objective clear?
- No, sir.

49
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:16,126
When you say the Indian Army,
what are we talking about?

50
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,325
- Five guys in a Humvee? What?
- Mitch?

51
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:25,688
They committed three infantry
divisions and two armored brigades...

52
00:03:25,893 --> 00:03:28,612
...as well as four CVEs
and two destroyers.

53
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:31,885
- All told?
- Approximately 300,000 troops, sir.

54
00:03:34,573 --> 00:03:38,361
- In the last 25 minutes?
- Yes, sir.

55
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:43,488
300,000 is an awfully large piece of
troop movement to have been on a whim.

56
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,323
- This was long planned.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:03:46,533 --> 00:03:51,732
All I'm trying to do is avoid making
eye contact with the CIA director.

58
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:54,242
- Mr. President--
- 300,000 troops?

59
00:03:54,453 --> 00:03:59,732
I can't move a motorcade without it
showing up on a weather satellite.

60
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:06,168
- We dropped the ball, sir.
- Pick it up again, would you, please?

61
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,081
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,167
- Any chance this is an exercise?
- No.

63
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:15,409
- A threat gesture?
- Possibly.

64
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:19,205
- Any nuclear activity?
- We don't know, sir.

65
00:04:19,413 --> 00:04:22,530
I wouldn't worry.
That's probably not important.

66
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,930
- We've ordered intense surveillance.
- How intense?

67
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,806
Satellites have been diverted
to the area.

68
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:32,847
The KH super platform's been tasked
into stationary orbit.

69
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:35,931
- How long till it's on station?
- Six hours.

70
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:44,649
I want the crisis task force activated
and a national security briefing.

71
00:04:44,853 --> 00:04:47,083
Thank you.

72
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:35,608
- What's the ambassador say?
- Which?

73
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,691
- Pakistani.
- Our guy there or their guy here?

74
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:40,929
- Ours.
- We haven't appointed one.

75
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,646
- You're kidding.
- No.

76
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,403
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

77
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,290
It's been over a year.
We have no one in Pakistan.

78
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,451
- Right.
- Maybe that's why they got invaded.

79
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:58,807
The Pakistanis have about 20,000
troops along the northern front...

80
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:02,164
...and four divisions
along the eastern front.

81
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,092
All this happened
without the CIA knowing?

82
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,885
I've already had words.

83
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:11,291
The U.N. is meeting
to try to effect a cease-fire.

84
00:06:11,493 --> 00:06:13,449
I feel better already.

85
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:17,931
- How could we not have an ambassador?
- We were getting to it.

86
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,852
How can the CIA miss
300,000 armed people--

87
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,965
Well, they've got
a very good photo now.

88
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:28,212
The idea is to spot them
before they cross the border, right?

89
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:33,441
- For now, it's conventional weapons?
- Toby, what do you know about this?

90
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:38,204
Any war between them
won't end with conventional weapons.

91
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,007
- You want to brief the hill?
- Yeah.

92
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,689
- Good evening.
- Hello.

93
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:48,923
- I'm sorry. Should I wait in the--?
- No. We were just breaking up.

94
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,205
- Can I say there's a full lid?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:56,565
I'll send them home.
Thank you, Mr. President.

96
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:59,765
I'll brief her in the morning.

97
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,002
Evening, ma'am.

98
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:07,321
- Charlie, how you doing?
- Good.

99
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,003
- Is he in?
- I'll tell him you're here.

100
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,523
- I'll just wait.
- Okay.

101
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:17,845
- Do you ever get a night off?
- No, actually.

102
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:20,123
- That's too bad.
- It's all right.

103
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,689
I meant it would be cool
to go out or something.

104
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,407
Yeah.

105
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:30,369
I'm sorry, with me?

106
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:35,368
You know you don't have to stand up
the whole time I'm in a room.

107
00:07:35,573 --> 00:07:39,566
Yeah. I don't know why I do that.

108
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:42,810
- Hi, Zoey.
- Is that Zoey?

109
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:45,163
Anyway, too bad.

110
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,163
- I've been subpoenaed.
- By Claypool?

111
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:54,409
The Freedom of Information Act.

112
00:07:54,613 --> 00:07:59,641
I was running the investigation after
we were all accused of taking drugs.

113
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:03,926
Not all, just one. Claypool's suing
you for the paperwork?

114
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:07,170
- I'm being deposed tomorrow.
- Who you bringing?

115
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:09,648
I'm not bringing anyone.

116
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:12,003
- Bring a lawyer.
- I am a lawyer.

117
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:15,285
- Bring a real lawyer.
- Thanks for the pep talk.

118
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,528
No sweat.

119
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:20,091
- What's up?
- Not too much.

120
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:23,365
- We'll look good in California.
- I'll look pale.

121
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:26,371
- I meant the president.
- I know.

122
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:30,725
Sam, can I talk to you a second?
In your office? Thanks.

123
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:32,002
What's up?

124
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:36,331
I may take a new client. It may
be a problem for Josh and Toby.

125
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,286
I was hoping
you'd help smooth the way.

126
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:43,168
- Who's the client?
- Mike Brace.

127
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,127
You're serious?

128
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:48,211
- Mike Brace is a Republican.
- I know that.

129
00:08:48,453 --> 00:08:50,728
You think they
might have a problem?

130
00:08:50,933 --> 00:08:54,323
He's moderate,
good on education and women's rights.

131
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,969
- He's Republican.
- He came to me. He sought me out.

132
00:08:58,173 --> 00:09:00,892
We'd come to you too.
In fact, we did.

133
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,890
I'm coming to you now.

134
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:07,564
So I'll help convince Josh and Toby
to let you work for a Republican.

135
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:09,604
Isn't this my lucky day.

136
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:15,126
You're the one more interested in
getting things done than beating--

137
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:18,644
- Josh and Toby are just as committed.
- Not lately.

138
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,525
I disagree.

139
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:24,726
The banking bill,
the land use rider, assault weapons.

140
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:28,608
- You like Mike Brace. I know.
- This is an impossible sell.

141
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:30,804
- It shouldn't be.
- It will be.

142
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,249
I know.

143
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,685
- I admire your pluck.
- What part of me do you admire?

144
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:40,770
Your pluck. Your gumption.

145
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,608
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

146
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:47,567
- You'll talk to Josh and Toby?
- You're going to owe me.

147
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:49,172
We'll be even.

148
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:52,843
I'll do this and many more favors,
and we'll be even.

149
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:55,009
Thank you.

150
00:09:57,693 --> 00:10:02,369
We'll have a briefing by the
Treasury on the market adjustment.

151
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:05,565
That's what we're calling it.
9:00 tomorrow.

152
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,287
With that, the lid is full.
You can go.

153
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:13,849
A source at the Pentagon says there's
been troop movement on Kashmir.

154
00:10:14,053 --> 00:10:18,922
In the last few hours? You need
a new source at the Pentagon, Bruce.

155
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:22,808
- There's nothing to it?
- What kind of troop movement?

156
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,811
300,000 troops and a few warships.

157
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:29,847
300,000 troops? Someone's
having a little fun with you.

158
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,523
- You sure?
- I was in the office 10 minutes ago.

159
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,850
- Have a good night.
- Good night, C.J. !

160
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:48,291
Fighting has occurred between Indian
troops and Pakistani border garrisons.

161
00:10:48,493 --> 00:10:51,565
The cease-fire line
has been breached twice.

162
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:55,049
With five divisions
invading north of Kargil...

163
00:10:56,173 --> 00:10:59,483
...and a force that's crossed west
into Azhad.

164
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:00,887
Bobby?

165
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:06,167
In the past hour, Prime Minister
Nohamid spoke on TV, saying that...

166
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:11,766
"...after enduring endless provocation
by the criminals running Pakistan...

167
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:14,726
...lndia's forbearance
has been exhausted.

168
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:20,132
In the name of peace, India is putting
an end to Pakistan's aggression."

169
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,402
And Pakistan?

170
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:25,652
They're condemning India's aggression
and pledging resistance.

171
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:31,202
We've got ourselves a ballgame.

172
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:38,124
- When do we get the nuclear briefing?
- This afternoon, 1500.

173
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:45,682
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:50,728
The Freedom of Information Act. He
wants to know about the investigation.

175
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,482
It wasn't an investigation.
Did he bring a lawyer?

176
00:11:54,693 --> 00:11:58,891
- Said he didn't need one.
- I like the sound of this.

177
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,926
- Leo's coming. C.J.'s already inside.
- Thanks.

178
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:09,410
- You know what this is about?
- Yeah.

179
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:13,401
- I stopped by your office before.
- I was at the reception.

180
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:17,168
What's going on?

181
00:12:17,373 --> 00:12:20,843
India sent troops
into the neutral zone in Kashmir.

182
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:27,367
The U.N.'s trying to get a cease-fire.
We'll play a role in 48 to 72 hours.

183
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,450
Brief the press tonight.

184
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:33,328
I want you in on some of the meetings
throughout the day.

185
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,966
Including this one.

186
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,091
This happened last night?

187
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:44,012
That's what you were talking about
before?

188
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:46,807
- I'm sorry.
- You said the lid was on.

189
00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:50,005
- You have to expect that.
- I got the question.

190
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:53,011
A guy had a Pentagon source.
I denied it.

191
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:57,172
- Is it 300,000? A couple destroyers?
- And four CVEs.

192
00:12:57,373 --> 00:13:01,412
- He hit it. I made fun of him.
- Say you spoke without knowing.

193
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,683
That's what I'll do.
Don't worry.

194
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,453
India's the story. This is forgotten.

195
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:10,612
- I'm fine. We're across the hall?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:22,843
- Your occupation?
- White House deputy chief of staff.

197
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,089
How long have you had the job?

198
00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:29,127
Since President Bartlet
was sworn in 12 months ago.

199
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,769
Have you been investigating,
over the past weeks...

200
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,851
...drug use by White House staffers?

201
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:41,207
I wouldn't call it an investigation.
It wasn't that serious.

202
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:46,883
You don't consider illegal drug use
at the White House to be serious?

203
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,290
Almost tripped me up
in that clever web of words.

204
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:54,122
I'd consider drug use
in the White House to be serious.

205
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,449
My investigation wasn't serious.

206
00:13:56,653 --> 00:14:00,487
You know it wasn't serious
because I was running it.

207
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,889
What prompted the investigation?

208
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:08,770
Congressman Lillienfield claimed one
in three White House staffers use drugs.

209
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:13,489
I was asked to discover what
would have caused him to say that.

210
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:15,285
Asked by whom?

211
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:19,884
The chief of staff
and the communications director.

212
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:23,403
The organization I represent
is suing...

213
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,288
...for the records
of your investigation.

214
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:33,011
I can save us all a lot of time. There
are no records of my investigation.

215
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:39,371
Before being deposed, did you tell
anybody we required your testimony?

216
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:44,570
- I mentioned it to a few people.
- Who were they?

217
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,805
- Sam Seaborn.
- Deputy communications director.

218
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:52,052
- Yes.
- Why'd you mention it to him?

219
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:55,325
- No particular reason.
- No particular reason?

220
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,968
- Yes.
- Really?

221
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:05,289
You brought up the subpoena
for no particular reason.

222
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:09,852
- Who else?
- My assistant, Donna Moss.

223
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:18,685
What did you tell Mr. Seaborn
and Miss Moss about this deposition?

224
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:22,848
I told them I had to waste a day
on this deposition.

225
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,692
What else did you tell them?

226
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:29,522
I probably told them
these moronic lawsuits of yours--

227
00:15:29,733 --> 00:15:30,848
Why do you--?

228
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:36,332
You're not after the truth.
You hate President Bartlet...

229
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:39,650
...and you're looking for
headlines and money.

230
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,287
You have two hours today
and tomorrow.

231
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,212
Will somebody
please offer me some coffee?

232
00:15:45,413 --> 00:15:49,804
India's population is about
one billion. 82% Hindu, 11% Muslim.

233
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:54,524
- They're not as poor as Pakistanis.
- Whose per capita income is $400.

234
00:15:54,733 --> 00:15:57,486
They are however, better educated.

235
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:01,242
And they're healthier.
Average life span is 57.7 years.

236
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:05,605
- What kind of briefing is this?
- If we could have another hour.

237
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:09,442
- Where did you get this?
- <i>The Encyclopedia Britannica</i>.

238
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:15,011
- I need a briefing.
- We're getting someone from State.

239
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,647
She'll get over it.

240
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:21,723
Let me ask you something
without your head exploding.

241
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:26,688
How would you react to Mandy working
for Mike Brace? He came to her.

242
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:29,361
- She wants to work for him?
- Maybe.

243
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,723
- Good afternoon.
- Mrs. Landingham.

244
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,401
- Is this a joke?
- You don't say hello?

245
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:38,526
Hello. Is this a joke?
I don't understand. I'm in disbelief.

246
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:41,446
- I'll say your reaction was--
- Disbelief!

247
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:45,043
- He's good on education--
- Are you shilling for her?

248
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,244
- I'm smoothing the way.
- Don't.

249
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:50,331
- She wants your temperature.
- Don't do that.

250
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:55,004
India has two intermediate-range
missiles named Agni 1 and 2.

251
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,010
Agni means "fire" in Hindi.

252
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:03,004
They have an A-bomb 50% more
destructive than the Hiroshima bomb.

253
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:06,290
- They have a thermonuclear device.
- An H-bomb?

254
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,404
What's the command situation?

255
00:17:08,813 --> 00:17:13,250
- This is the terrifying part.
- I was waiting for a terrifying part.

256
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:17,332
CCI systems are unreliable. They put
money in weapons...

257
00:17:17,533 --> 00:17:20,127
- ...and ignore safeguards.
- Like what?

258
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:25,532
Dual launch controls, chain of
command, monitoring, testing.

259
00:17:25,733 --> 00:17:29,362
Leaders don't share information.
It might weaken them.

260
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:33,327
I'll read this from a DOD overview:

261
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:38,402
"At times, both countries have shown
an incoherent decision-making system.

262
00:17:38,773 --> 00:17:43,005
You cannot predict
what will happen in a crisis."

263
00:17:49,493 --> 00:17:53,930
Well, bring in Dr. Strangelove,
and we're all set.

264
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,964
- Thanks, Joe.
- Sure.

265
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:59,445
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

266
00:18:05,773 --> 00:18:10,449
- There's an expert I want to bring in.
- Who?

267
00:18:12,093 --> 00:18:14,163
- No.
- You guys will love him.

268
00:18:14,373 --> 00:18:16,250
- He's a lunatic.
- Colorful.

269
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:17,482
Certifiable.

270
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,207
- Who?
- Lord John Marbury.

271
00:18:20,413 --> 00:18:23,166
Former ambassador to New Delhi.

272
00:18:23,373 --> 00:18:26,126
- Where do we find him?
- An institution.

273
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,322
He's colorful.

274
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,923
You'll let him loose
where there's liquor and women?

275
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:34,170
We can hide the women,
but he deserves a drink.

276
00:18:34,373 --> 00:18:35,852
Get him on a plane.

277
00:18:36,053 --> 00:18:39,443
- Anything else?
- Thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:54,412
Can I just say this about Mandy's
representing Mike Brace?

279
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:58,162
- I should say something to C.J.
- It'll be patronizing.

280
00:18:58,373 --> 00:19:01,843
If you don't, it says
you think she's a professional.

281
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,851
- I'm going to go see her.
- See what you do?

282
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:08,329
You ask for my advice,
and you ignore it.

283
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,284
Carol?

284
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:16,361
The next few weeks, it's important
to reassure Americans...

285
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:20,043
...the president
is working hard to defuse the crisis.

286
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:23,723
- They're misspelling New Delhi.
- The "H" is wrong?

287
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,926
- I'm happy when they use an "H" at all.
- We'll fix it.

288
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,930
We're fixing the "H" !

289
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:35,687
I was warned that coming to talk
to you might be insulting.

290
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:39,488
- You wouldn't want that.
- It wasn't ready for the press.

291
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:43,129
Could have told me before
sending me in. I denied it.

292
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:46,928
I said, "I was in the office,
and nothing's going on."

293
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:51,649
- They don't think you lied.
- I know. They think you lied to me.

294
00:19:51,853 --> 00:19:57,007
They don't know me. I'm from nowhere.
I was just starting to get respect.

295
00:19:57,253 --> 00:19:59,813
Know how long it'll take
to get it back?

296
00:20:00,013 --> 00:20:02,208
"Don't ask C.J.
She doesn't know."

297
00:20:02,413 --> 00:20:06,122
There's a concern you're
too friendly with the press.

298
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,403
It's important you're friendly.

299
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:10,808
- For all of us!
- I don't disagree.

300
00:20:11,013 --> 00:20:13,049
Does this have to do
with Danny?

301
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,245
- People see you with him.
- This is outrageous.

302
00:20:16,453 --> 00:20:20,446
- If we erred, it's--
- You sent me in uninformed so I'd lie.

303
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:25,090
We sent you in uninformed because
we thought maybe you couldn't.

304
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:33,205
I have all this work to do.

305
00:20:45,813 --> 00:20:47,246
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

306
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:51,082
- Going back? Take a lawyer.
- You got 450 bucks an hour?

307
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:53,170
Then mind your own business.

308
00:20:53,373 --> 00:20:55,364
- It's this guy.
- Sam's going.

309
00:20:55,573 --> 00:20:59,043
In the middle of a crisis,
what better place for him?

310
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:02,802
- Two hours. Just do it.
- Was C.J. pissed?

311
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:18,085
The Chinese ambassador will be in
in a moment.

312
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,409
This ought to be delightful.

313
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:26,330
Thanks for staying late, Charlie.

314
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,692
I'd like to ask you a question.

315
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:34,602
How would you feel
about my going on a date with Zoey?

316
00:21:34,813 --> 00:21:38,408
- I'm sorry?
- Zoey said, if I had a free night--

317
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,605
She asked? Should have
put her in the dungeon.

318
00:21:41,813 --> 00:21:44,452
- You don't have one.
- I could build one.

319
00:21:44,653 --> 00:21:46,371
If it's not a problem--

320
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:50,407
You have picked the worst time
to talk to me about this.

321
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:53,446
- I think he's here.
- Thank you, sir.

322
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,606
He wants to go out with Zoey.

323
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:02,407
Shut up!

324
00:22:04,693 --> 00:22:07,765
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Good evening, Mr. President.

325
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,771
Thanks for seeing us
on such short notice.

326
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:14,727
- Thank you. Good evening, Leo.
- Please, sit down.

327
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:21,122
It is crucial that we bring about a
cease-fire and a pull-back...

328
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,086
...before this conflict takes
another step.

329
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:28,606
- We have every hope for your success.
- You do?

330
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,252
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:35,766
However, I've been instructed to
inform you that China won't allow...

332
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:40,803
...lndia's aggression against Kashmir,
as it intensifies the threat...

333
00:22:41,013 --> 00:22:43,971
...of Indian aggressors
on our own border.

334
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:51,206
- Are you saying China might intervene?
- The Indians must be stopped.

335
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:55,088
Of course China would like
to see a peaceful solution...

336
00:22:55,293 --> 00:23:00,572
...but we are prepared
to use whatever force is necessary.

337
00:23:03,573 --> 00:23:08,124
This just keeps getting
better and better.

338
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,688
- Did you speak to him?
- Toby? I did.

339
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:22,532
And? He didn't go for it.

340
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:27,523
- It wasn't what you were hoping for.
- You told him about women's issues?

341
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:31,487
Did you tell him enthusiastically?
Did you tell him--?

342
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:35,288
I told him everything.
He did not warm to the idea.

343
00:23:35,493 --> 00:23:37,006
- Let's go.
- I'm ready.

344
00:23:37,213 --> 00:23:41,764
- Talk to him. Enthusiastically.
- Talk to me about what?

345
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:44,487
Mandy wants Mike Brace
as a client.

346
00:23:44,693 --> 00:23:47,924
- Is there another Mike Brace?
- Not in the House.

347
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:51,364
- She knows he's Republican?
- She's pretty bright.

348
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:53,882
- I'm gonna kill her.
- So, no way?

349
00:23:54,093 --> 00:23:56,049
That's a big 10-4.

350
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:03,132
Mr. Ambassador,
you know Leo McGarry.

351
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,484
- Good to see you again.
- Terrible circumstances.

352
00:24:06,693 --> 00:24:08,331
Please, sit down.

353
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:12,367
We're trying to phone
your prime minister without any luck.

354
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:16,328
The prime minister is occupied
organizing our response...

355
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:20,890
...to this aggression by India,
but I'll do my best to help you.

356
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:26,565
I stood at a podium this morning and
condemned the incursion by India.

357
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:29,685
Your condemnation
could have been stronger.

358
00:24:29,893 --> 00:24:31,531
It might have been...

359
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:36,011
...if my State Department didn't feel
Indian action was provoked.

360
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,408
I think you're being misinformed.

361
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:41,446
You deny Pakistani activity
in the neutral zone?

362
00:24:41,653 --> 00:24:46,363
The people of Kashmir are demanding
their rights guaranteed by the U.N.

363
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:52,603
The recent unrest is the result of an
oppression of a defenseless people.

364
00:24:52,813 --> 00:24:56,249
The people he's talking about
aren't defenseless.

365
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,082
They're carrying the M-16s
we sold them.

366
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:04,844
The U.S. is committed to finding
a reasonable solution to the dispute.

367
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:09,331
It is not a dispute, but illegal
occupation by the Indian state.

368
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:14,209
Whatever the language, I know you
will agree we have to find a way...

369
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:17,928
...for these countries to exist
in a global community.

370
00:25:18,133 --> 00:25:21,728
That sounds nice, but Pakistan
doesn't wish to exist...

371
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:25,050
...in a global community
with criminals.

372
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:32,249
I'd imagine the Indian ambassador
is going to say the same about you.

373
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:34,525
Be that as it may.

374
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:41,366
- Thank you for coming.
- Yes, Mr. President.

375
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:51,489
I'll take the Indian ambassador
in the Oval Office.

376
00:25:51,693 --> 00:25:55,652
Then ask the Secret Service
to step in and kill me, please.

377
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:06,726
- Zoey walked up and asked him out.
- She's very outgoing.

378
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:12,405
A dungeon would put an end to that.
You're trying to cover your enjoyment.

379
00:26:12,653 --> 00:26:16,009
- I'm not trying to cover it.
- I'm a father in pain.

380
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:19,728
Really, you're just a pain.
You got a racial problem?

381
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:24,083
- A racial problem? I don't.
- Okay.

382
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,410
- I don't have a racial problem.
- Okay.

383
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:31,966
I'm Spencer Tracy at the end
of <i>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</i>.

384
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:38,646
My problem's not racial. She's a girl
and he's not. And he's older.

385
00:26:38,853 --> 00:26:42,812
- She's 19, he's 21.
- A guy learns a lot in those two years.

386
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,286
Tracy was good in that movie.

387
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:56,283
- You look well.
- I looked better...

388
00:26:56,493 --> 00:27:00,725
...before your country breached
about 14 cease-fire conditions.

389
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:05,563
Let's sit down and talk.
Charlie, please close the door.

390
00:27:05,773 --> 00:27:09,322
You didn't make a single note?
You're asking--

391
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,649
This is your seventh lawsuit...

392
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:17,086
...and the fourth time you've
demanded documents that don't exist.

393
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:21,963
In your investigation
in which you wrote nothing--

394
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:25,210
It's nice the White House
takes this seriously.

395
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:29,884
In your investigation, did you find
any evidence of staff drug use?

396
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:32,607
- No.
- I'd remind you you're under oath.

397
00:27:32,813 --> 00:27:38,251
I'd remind you that's the seventh time
you've reminded him since he sat down.

398
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:41,013
Are there alcoholics
in the White House?

399
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:44,250
- I would imagine there are.
- You would imagine?

400
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:48,571
- Statistics suggest--
- You know for sure there are.

401
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:51,486
Yes.

402
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:55,732
What are their names?
The public has a right to know.

403
00:27:55,973 --> 00:27:59,283
- Drinking isn't illegal.
- I mean a higher standard.

404
00:27:59,493 --> 00:28:04,203
He's not telling you names of people
he knows to be alcoholics. Move on.

405
00:28:04,413 --> 00:28:07,928
Is Leo McGarry an alcoholic?

406
00:28:08,293 --> 00:28:10,761
I won't answer that.

407
00:28:10,973 --> 00:28:14,886
- Has he had treatment for alcoholism?
- I won't answer that.

408
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,609
- Has he had treatment for Valium?
- He's not obligated to answer that.

409
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:22,691
It's irrelevant
to your cause of action...

410
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:28,411
...in which you want documents about
drug use in the White House.

411
00:28:28,653 --> 00:28:32,487
We go see the judge right now,
she'll sustain my objection.

412
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,604
During your investigation...

413
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:39,329
...did you see Secret Service files
of people you were investigating?

414
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:43,287
- There was no investigation.
- Did you look at these files?

415
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:46,053
- Yes.
- Including Leo McGarry's?

416
00:28:47,213 --> 00:28:48,282
Yes.

417
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,530
I have a record you
would have had access to.

418
00:28:51,733 --> 00:28:53,132
How'd you get that?

419
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:59,727
It says Leo McGarry spent 28 days
in a substance abuse facility.

420
00:28:59,973 --> 00:29:02,328
This is obtained illegally.

421
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:05,730
That's my problem.
Just answer this question.

422
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,208
In your investigation
of McGarry...

423
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:12,122
...did you find he was
not only treated for alcoholism...

424
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:15,729
...he was treated
for Valium addiction as well?

425
00:29:17,053 --> 00:29:19,806
Should we ask a judge about that?

426
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:23,244
- We're going to postpone this.
- I'm not finished.

427
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:24,681
We're postponing.

428
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,566
You got a problem,
cite us for contempt.

429
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:30,805
You should be concerned
with your reputations.

430
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:34,528
The idea of you standing up
for a man so unqualified--

431
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,325
Go.

432
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:51,326
You're a hack, and if you come after
Leo, I'll bust you like a pinata.

433
00:29:56,213 --> 00:30:01,162
Your frustration is because you can't
control us with economic sanctions.

434
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:07,642
My frustration is you have nuclear
weapons and a tendency to get cranky.

435
00:30:07,853 --> 00:30:12,608
India will be a nuclear power.
We'll never be dictated to again.

436
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:20,808
- It was nice spending time with you.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

437
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,611
Thank you.

438
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:35,443
When he talks about
colonial western imperialism...

439
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:41,330
...I want to remind him the U.S.
also threw off its colonial masters.

440
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:44,843
- Why don't you?
- I keep forgetting.

441
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:50,642
- Is he here? Send him in, please.
- God help me.

442
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:55,322
John! Thank you for coming.

443
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:58,570
- How was the flight?
- Intoxicating.

444
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,684
Allow me to present myself.

445
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:04,932
- I was summoned by your president.
- We've met, 10 or 12 times.

446
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:08,250
- I'm Leo McGarry.
- I thought you were the butler.

447
00:31:08,453 --> 00:31:10,728
I'm the White House chief of staff.

448
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:13,493
Would you have a light
for my cigarette?

449
00:31:13,693 --> 00:31:16,571
There's no smoking
in this part of the world.

450
00:31:16,773 --> 00:31:19,970
Really? In this part over here,
we encourage it.

451
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:25,566
It's "Your Lordship," but it
couldn't make the least difference.

452
00:31:25,773 --> 00:31:27,843
Tell me, how can I be
of service?

453
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:31,568
If it's within my power to give,
you shall have it.

454
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:37,245
- We need your take on the situation.
- What is your take on the situation?

455
00:31:37,453 --> 00:31:41,526
The world's coming apart
at the seams.

456
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:45,330
Then, thank God you sent for me.

457
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,847
Yes.

458
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,730
His name is Lord John Marbury,
the hereditary Earl of Sherlbourne.

459
00:31:52,933 --> 00:31:55,288
He's related to a former viceroy...

460
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:59,526
...and served as the
Queen's minister to India or Pakistan.

461
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,088
He's here to counsel the president.

462
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:07,845
If you think this sounds
like an operetta, I don't blame you.

463
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:11,807
- Thank you. Yes?
- Toby's here.

464
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:18,082
Hello.

465
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,812
I feel I didn't properly articulate
my argument.

466
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:29,603
Either I'm a trusted staff member
or not. What was your argument?

467
00:32:29,813 --> 00:32:32,646
- That was my argument.
- That wasn't.

468
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:37,005
That was, a little while ago,
when I was arguing in my head.

469
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:46,767
- Are you apologizing?
- Yes.

470
00:32:56,853 --> 00:32:58,889
Well?

471
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,852
- What?
- Apologize.

472
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,603
- I'm sorry!
- God.

473
00:33:05,293 --> 00:33:08,330
I was trying to do it nicer than that.

474
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:11,610
- Whose idea was it?
- Mine.

475
00:33:11,813 --> 00:33:14,885
You said, "India invaded.
Let's not tell C.J."?

476
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:18,927
- I didn't say it like that.
- How'd you say it?

477
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,328
I said it nicer.

478
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:33,087
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Did everything go okay?

479
00:33:33,293 --> 00:33:37,525
No, actually, it didn't. Thanks.

480
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:47,368
- You're back.
- Toby apologized to me, in his way.

481
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:50,167
I need to tell you guys something.

482
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:25,446
- Did you talk to him?
- What?

483
00:34:27,093 --> 00:34:30,005
- Did you talk to him?
- It's a bad idea.

484
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:32,773
- Did you tell him about--?
- No.

485
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:36,124
You're the champion
of bipartisan cooperation--

486
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:37,766
Leo's in trouble.

487
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:42,489
You're a consultant. Your job isn't
to end the fight. It's to win it.

488
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:47,005
You can work for us or for them,
but you can't do both.

489
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:50,083
- Let's go.
- I'm ready.

490
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,044
I think that's nonsense.

491
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:02,802
You're overestimating the possibility
of escalation...

492
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:06,204
- ...beyond the point we're at now.
- Interesting.

493
00:35:06,413 --> 00:35:09,052
- Thank you.
- What is your name again?

494
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:13,563
Ensconced in the cocoon
of your Cold War victory...

495
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:17,288
...you are ignorant
of the powerful agents in Asia.

496
00:35:17,493 --> 00:35:23,762
The free market created an illusion
that the world is drawing closer.

497
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:28,967
Your congress is inept at halting
nuclear weapon proliferation there...

498
00:35:29,173 --> 00:35:34,088
...and your intelligence gathering
is weak.

499
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:40,448
India and Pakistan have fought three
wars since they gained independence...

500
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:44,532
...with God knows how many
skirmishes in between.

501
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:47,725
It is about religion.

502
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:52,564
I can assure you they do not share
our fear of the bomb.

503
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:02,446
I have a telephone call.
May I take it, please, in your foyer?

504
00:36:02,653 --> 00:36:05,884
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

505
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,447
I don't even think the accent's real.

506
00:36:11,653 --> 00:36:14,690
I'm going to ask him to stay
and help us out.

507
00:36:14,893 --> 00:36:19,125
- For how long?
- You are going to become good friends.

508
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:25,044
- He thinks I'm the butler.
- The first couple of weeks, so did I.

509
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:27,448
- Excuse me.
- Hello, Margaret.

510
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:29,609
What do you need?

511
00:36:32,093 --> 00:36:34,653
Would you excuse me for a moment?

512
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:43,847
- What's going on?
- It didn't go well.

513
00:36:44,093 --> 00:36:46,607
Claypool's got your records
from rehab.

514
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,407
He must have got them
from Lillienfield.

515
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:53,447
I was about to perjure myself,
so Sam ended the deposition.

516
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:58,124
Claypool will call a reporter.
You're going to read about this.

517
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,211
I wanted to ask you,
does your family know?

518
00:37:01,413 --> 00:37:03,529
- If they don't, Leo--
- They know.

519
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:06,566
- The president?
- Yes.

520
00:37:09,053 --> 00:37:11,726
You ready for this?

521
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,729
Yes.

522
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:21,331
Then we're here for whatever you need.
We just wanted to tell you that.

523
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,931
- He still on the phone?
- Yes, sir.

524
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,526
Do you need anything?

525
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:42,452
I can't remember
a quote from Revelations.

526
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:45,611
I can't help you.
I've never read Revelations.

527
00:37:45,813 --> 00:37:49,044
- Why not?
- Never got around to it.

528
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:52,165
Say, listen....

529
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:56,651
My hesitation about you and Zoey,
it's not because you're black.

530
00:37:56,853 --> 00:37:59,208
I thought it was because I'm a guy.

531
00:37:59,413 --> 00:38:01,768
- It is.
- I understand.

532
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:06,772
I want you to go out with her
if that's what you want.

533
00:38:06,973 --> 00:38:09,441
- I'd like to.
- That's fine.

534
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:12,087
- Thank you.
- Just remember two things:

535
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:15,330
She's 19,
and the 82nd Airborne works for me.

536
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:20,004
- Yes, sir.
- Also this, no kidding.

537
00:38:20,213 --> 00:38:23,762
You go out with Zoey,
you'll get your picture taken.

538
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:29,047
There will be people not wild about
you and the president's daughter.

539
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:32,006
You know what to do
with the mail, right?

540
00:38:35,733 --> 00:38:38,042
All right.

541
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:40,767
- You keep your head up.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,009
I should have built a dungeon.

543
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:46,723
Revelations. It's about a horse,
and Death was on it.

544
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:50,289
I really never read it.
Should I go check it out?

545
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:53,451
Yes, please. Thank you, Charlie.

546
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:00,482
Good. I want you all to meet John.

547
00:39:00,693 --> 00:39:04,686
Before Lord Fauntleroy--
Whatever. Before he comes back...

548
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:08,681
...I wanted to tell you
Josh's deposition did not go well.

549
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:12,363
The story will probably break soon.

550
00:39:12,573 --> 00:39:17,328
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

551
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,889
Don't ever forget
the battles you fought and won.

552
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:29,247
I'm back, and I believe there are
many more people in the room.

553
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:31,887
Excellent deducing, Your Lordship.

554
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:35,051
The call was from the British
U.N. ambassador.

555
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:38,563
He thinks there'll be
a cease-fire resolution soon.

556
00:39:38,773 --> 00:39:41,890
I'd heard that,
but all they got was two weeks.

557
00:39:42,093 --> 00:39:44,402
It's two weeks better than nothing.

558
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:48,891
I was hoping you'd stick around
a couple days and help us out.

559
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:52,403
However long it takes
is as long as I shall serve.

560
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:55,252
Let's play it by ear.

561
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,369
You're all frightened,
as well you should be.

562
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:03,606
Not since the Protestant-Catholic wars
has Western society...

563
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:08,728
...known anything comparable to the
subcontinent's religious malevolence.

564
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:13,012
To a lesser observer, the intensity
of the emotional frenzy...

565
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:16,523
...is so illogical
as to border on mass psychosis.

566
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:22,883
But as has been said by kings and
queens, I am not a lesser observer.

567
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,442
There's a quote from Revelations--

568
00:40:25,653 --> 00:40:30,169
"And I beheld a pale horse, and the
name that sat on him was Death...

569
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:33,922
...and Hell followed with him."

570
00:40:35,773 --> 00:40:38,082
Are you frightened, John?

571
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:43,731
Do you mean, do I think we can
stop a war in the next two weeks?

572
00:40:43,933 --> 00:40:46,845
- Yes.
- Good.

573
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:49,203
But...

574
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:53,528
...I shall require a light.

575
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:38,842
