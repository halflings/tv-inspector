1
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:08,372
<i>Previously:</i>

2
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,807
I came with someone.

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,327
Al.

4
00:00:12,253 --> 00:00:14,767
Have you heard
about a piece of paper?

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,567
I know everything about it.
I wrote it.

6
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,491
- What is it?
- Strategy memo.

7
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,604
- Strategy to do what?
- Beat us.

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,882
- Who has it?
- I do.

9
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:25,965
I am a recovering alcoholic
and drug addict.

10
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:29,091
Leo, two seats opened up
on the FEC?

11
00:00:29,293 --> 00:00:32,171
- The Senate will fill them.
- We want our guys.

12
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,609
Embarrass us, and we'll
give the same back tenfold.

13
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,122
I get nervous around laws
that assume Americans...

14
00:00:46,893 --> 00:00:50,044
...can't be trusted.
We need mandatory sentencing...

15
00:00:50,213 --> 00:00:54,570
...because judges can't be trusted
to disperse even-handed justice.

16
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,571
We need term limits...

17
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:04,569
...because voters can't be trusted
to recognize corruption.

18
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,042
When the playing field is level...

19
00:01:07,213 --> 00:01:11,411
...and when the process is fair
and open, we have term limits.

20
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,406
They're called elections.

21
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:23,410
He ate his Wheaties.

22
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:28,966
The president had a bowl of oatmeal.
Something he's always wanted to try.

23
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:32,648
Folks, listen up.

24
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:37,807
The president's going to say something
that'll get you all shouting my name.

25
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:42,125
There'll be a full briefing
at the White House.

26
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:46,491
- You're not gonna want to miss this.
- What's going on?

27
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:50,532
The president's
throwing his cap over the wall.

28
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,686
My father was very fond
of the analogy of the Irish lads...

29
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:03,246
...whose journey was blocked by a
wall seemingly too high to scale.

30
00:02:03,453 --> 00:02:08,573
Throwing their caps over the wall,
the lads had no choice but to follow.

31
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,805
How many times
in the history of our country...

32
00:02:11,973 --> 00:02:15,010
...have we come to a wall
too high to scale...?

33
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:20,201
This was given to me by a constituent
who read that I like cognac.

34
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,207
The problem is that this is brandy
and not cognac.

35
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:26,125
Anyone know the difference?

36
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:30,889
- Cognac's supposed to come from--
- The Cognac region of France. Right.

37
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:33,487
Steve, sit down over here, would you?

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,566
- He won't say anything interesting.
- I think he is.

39
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,327
- What are you talking about?
- Listen.

40
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:45,408
<i>Tomorrow morning we'll begin to change</i>
<i>the way elections are supervised.</i>

41
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:52,003
- He'll name two reformers to the FEC.
- What? You said it wouldn't happen.

42
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:53,970
- I was wrong.
- You were wrong?

43
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:57,364
He's gonna name John Bacon
and Patty Calhoun.

44
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,963
You told him they take on
campaign finance reform...

45
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:04,808
...I roll out a legislative agenda
that makes them cry?

46
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,691
I made it very clear.

47
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:09,851
<i>I am proud to nominate</i>
<i>John Branford Bacon...</i>

48
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:13,892
<i>...and Patricia Calhoun</i>
<i>to the Federal Election Commission.</i>

49
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,321
- Get him.
- Who?

50
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:18,047
Josh Lyman, get him on the phone.

51
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:22,764
I'm gonna reach down his throat
and take out his lungs with a scoop.

52
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:24,770
You're about to get a call.

53
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,605
- Yeah.
- Big call.

54
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,445
Powerful guy.

55
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:32,367
- You're still rocked from last week.
- A little.

56
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:37,891
They threatened you with an agenda.
You feel powerless, off your game.

57
00:03:38,053 --> 00:03:40,647
- A little gun-shy.
- Leave him alone.

58
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,929
You asked me to buck him up.

59
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:47,723
- I'm telling you to leave him alone.
- I'm trying to watch the speech.

60
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,123
- The call?
- On the cell.

61
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,289
You need us, we're right here.

62
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:54,806
Okay.
Hi, senator.

63
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:58,852
Take your legislative agenda
and shove it up your ass.

64
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,091
Turns out I was fine.

65
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:56,810
Is the White House worried the FEC
will become a political football?

66
00:04:56,973 --> 00:05:01,728
Again, the president nominated
one Democrat and one Republican...

67
00:05:01,893 --> 00:05:05,886
...which he was certainly
under no legal obligation to do.

68
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:09,361
FEC commissioners have been chosen--

69
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:14,527
--by signing off on whomever
congressional leadership pointed to.

70
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:19,050
Was Congress aware the president
would slip this into his speech?

71
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:23,809
I think it's possible
we forgot to tell them.

72
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:27,851
Is the president
declaring war on Congress?

73
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,810
Say it's a police action.

74
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:34,251
<i>The president is empowered</i>
<i>to nominate federal agency directors.</i>

75
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,404
<i>It's more of a police action.</i>

76
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,723
How about that?

77
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,846
Toby wants you in his office.

78
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,532
- You know why?
- Polling.

79
00:05:43,693 --> 00:05:45,843
- He's bringing Kiefer?
- He'll say.

80
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,801
- Why can't you?
- You're going to his office and l--

81
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:57,009
- Yes, he's bringing in Al Kiefer.
- Big polling week. I figured he was.

82
00:05:57,173 --> 00:06:00,688
- That's what you were afraid to say?
- I wasn't afraid.

83
00:06:00,853 --> 00:06:05,324
The thing is, Kiefer wants to bring in
a California expert.

84
00:06:05,493 --> 00:06:09,008
- That's a good idea. Wait.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:11,687
- Joey Lucas.
- She's coming with Kiefer.

86
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:17,688
- I was afraid to tell you.
- You shouldn't be. Know why?

87
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:20,367
- No big deal.
- I'll tell you what else.

88
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,922
- You're a pro.
- Yes, but that's not it.

89
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:26,085
- What were you going to say?
- That was it.

90
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:28,528
But it's true. I'm a pro.
What else?

91
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:30,365
- It's no big deal.
- Right.

92
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,683
- Rambo.
- You talking to me?

93
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,925
- Nice call.
- That's how we do it in New England!

94
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:39,642
- In Indiana, we can't curse.
- In Jersey, we encourage it.

95
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,849
- Where's Toby?
- In Sam's office.

96
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:46,168
Hang on.

97
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:48,531
That's good.

98
00:06:51,693 --> 00:06:53,206
Good.

99
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,802
Okay. Sam?

100
00:06:56,973 --> 00:06:59,726
- Yeah?
- You'll come to a verb soon, right?

101
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:01,963
- Know what this is?
- Bad writing?

102
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,283
- Imagery.
- You say potato.

103
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:09,049
- Josh, I'm bringing in Al Kiefer.
- You've turned 180 degrees on Kiefer.

104
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:12,325
I don't want his advice,
I want his numbers.

105
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:15,730
- Advising is what pollsters do.
- He'll do what I say.

106
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,851
- National language.
- First thing they'll hit.

107
00:07:19,053 --> 00:07:22,204
We need Hispanics.
What state has a lot of them?

108
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:27,208
I want to say Maine. California.
I was only off by a continent.

109
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:30,644
- Josh.
- It's fine. Bring her out here.

110
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:33,526
- She's here tomorrow.
- This isn't a thing.

111
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:36,482
I met her twice.

112
00:07:36,693 --> 00:07:39,924
Yeah, but one of those times
she broke your heart.

113
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:42,369
You know,
the way women can do.

114
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:47,687
They take your heart, throw it down
and stomp on it with their high heels.

115
00:07:47,853 --> 00:07:51,687
She's a beautiful, interesting woman.
I see why guys go for her.

116
00:07:54,453 --> 00:08:00,449
There's nothing at all I'm saying of
any value, so I'll just keep writing.

117
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,165
We had a good night.

118
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:09,685
C.J.'s doing great.

119
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,692
Anytime you want to use punctuation,
that would be fine.

120
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,043
One more question. Katie.

121
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:28,331
The FEC's role has never been
that much more than symbolic--

122
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:32,492
The FEC isn't symbolic,
but I agree that they're toothless.

123
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,725
Then will two new commissioners
make any difference?

124
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:36,928
- No.
- Why do it?

125
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:41,172
Symbolism. There'll be more tomorrow.
Have a good night.

126
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:52,128
Jack, C.J.'s inviting you
to follow up on some things.

127
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,567
- Me?
- Yeah.

128
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:57,210
She doesn't want me.
She wants Danny.

129
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,971
No, she asked for you.

130
00:08:59,653 --> 00:09:04,249
Danny, the senior correspondent.
If there's gonna be an exclusive--

131
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,768
She wants you.

132
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,607
Mandatory minimums are racist.
They're a red herring.

133
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:21,762
I understand.

134
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:25,164
Look tough on crime
without being tough on crime.

135
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,131
I know.
We do things one thing at a time.

136
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:31,205
- We don't have time.
- You mean treatment.

137
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:35,730
Treatment and about mandatory
minimums. It's a red herring.

138
00:09:35,893 --> 00:09:40,171
Talk to the president about
treatment versus enforcement.

139
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,846
Don't stray from that.

140
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:44,481
Toby, you said,
"You're in charge."

141
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:48,532
You're in charge in the sense
that you're subordinate to me.

142
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:50,524
- Where's this place?
- What?

143
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:52,729
- The breakfast place.
- Back there.

144
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:57,683
- Why didn't you say anything?
- We were having a nice conversation.

145
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:04,367
- Some tomato juice while you wait?
- Thanks, Celia.

146
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,606
- All set there?
- Yeah.

147
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:28,009
- Why not closer to the office?
- I wanted privacy.

148
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,643
- We couldn't meet in the office?
- I was hungry. Sit down.

149
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,646
You should notice
that Josh has on a nice suit.

150
00:10:34,813 --> 00:10:38,249
- We'll call it his Joey Lucas suit.
- Joey Lucas is coming?

151
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,450
She's a California expert.
This is my Tuesday suit.

152
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:44,372
You assign your clothes
days of the week?

153
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,684
I'm saying there's
no particular m.o.--

154
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,491
About time. Sit down.

155
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:53,365
Hang on. Talk to me about drugs.

156
00:10:53,533 --> 00:10:57,082
We can make a case
for treatment versus enforcement.

157
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:01,292
We're ready to go with minimums
on crack versus powder cocaine.

158
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:02,767
One step at a time.

159
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,764
- Toby said that.
- He's right.

160
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,089
Remember, I was put in charge--

161
00:11:07,293 --> 00:11:09,409
It was an honorary kind of thing.

162
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:15,928
- Are you ready to order?
- Write these names down.

163
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:19,972
Dalton, Dawson,
Foxworthy, Greer...

164
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:24,166
...Morgenthau, Stackhouse,
Sugarbaker.

165
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,885
Thank you.

166
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,567
- What was that?
- You know what that was.

167
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,412
Leo, what should I do
with these names?

168
00:11:32,613 --> 00:11:36,322
- Hold on to them until I say so.
- That's the right thing.

169
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,171
From anybody but me.

170
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:43,202
I'd like to clear up that I don't
have suits for days of the week.

171
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,728
- This is just a suit.
- It's a nice suit.

172
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:50,290
Sure, it's his Joey Lucas suit.
I'm regretting not getting waffles.

173
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:53,490
I'm regretting having hired
any of you.

174
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:57,009
42% job approval,
and you're talking about waffles...

175
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:58,970
...and something with Josh.

176
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:03,212
- He's wearing a suit for Joey Lucas.
- For a guy named Joey?

177
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,365
She's a woman,
and I'm not dressed up for her.

178
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:07,682
It's a Tuesday suit.

179
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:11,806
Point is, we have to make it
through the week with no mistakes.

180
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:13,002
We will.

181
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:15,727
- I'm saying calm down.
- I'm calm.

182
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:19,528
You're not calm. You're acting
like a nervous holyillia.

183
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,448
A what?

184
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:28,087
May not be a word. May just be
something my mother used to say.

185
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:38,203
It's a huge mistake.
A huge mistake, Mr. President.

186
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:39,931
Possibly a fatal one.

187
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,085
It'll doom the midterms,
haunt the convention...

188
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:48,088
...and if you manage to get nominated,
there's no way you win re-election.

189
00:12:48,293 --> 00:12:50,853
Al's Mr. Good News Happy Guy.

190
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:56,403
More voters disapprove than approve
of the president's job performance.

191
00:12:56,613 --> 00:13:00,242
42% approval. Not the time
to come out for legalization.

192
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,766
We're not.

193
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:06,125
It's gonna be a long day.
Kiefer's just getting warmed up.

194
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,408
Listen.

195
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,649
- You're kidding.
- No.

196
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:17,766
- He doesn't want me in there?
- Leo's not comfortable with it.

197
00:13:17,973 --> 00:13:21,090
- I want to talk to the president.
- You can't.

198
00:13:21,293 --> 00:13:24,126
- It was just a memo.
- It wasn't just a memo.

199
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:27,091
Do you know how pissed
people are at you?

200
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:32,290
They're pissed at me.
That's how pissed they are at you.

201
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:35,610
- I can be trusted.
- We'll see.

202
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:42,244
Leo would feel more comfortable
if you stayed out of his way.

203
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:48,085
- You are--
- Drug control.

204
00:13:48,253 --> 00:13:49,652
- Listen.
- Listen to Sam.

205
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:53,243
- Drug control appropriations...
- 17.6 billion.

206
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:58,686
...are 2/3 enforcement, 1/3 treatment.
We want to reverse that ratio.

207
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:02,283
- Spend less on enforcement?
- Spend more on treatment.

208
00:14:02,493 --> 00:14:06,122
Soft on crime. You don't care
if kids shoot up at recess.

209
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:09,052
- We don't care. Do we, Sam?
- What'd I miss?

210
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:12,285
45 minutes and he's already
got me at recess.

211
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:14,883
Took you 45 minutes?

212
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:20,402
We have some numbers from the Office
of National Drug Control Policy.

213
00:14:20,573 --> 00:14:21,722
Let's hear them.

214
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:26,643
55,624 federal prisoners,
half the federal prison population....

215
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:30,089
- What's up?
- Joey Lucas is in your office.

216
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,086
- Why are you smiling?
- Fine-looking woman.

217
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:38,403
- Yes.
- I can help you out.

218
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:41,167
- With what?
- She's a fine-looking woman.

219
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:43,847
You got me this job.
I'll pay you back.

220
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,766
By helping me?
What makes you think I need help?

221
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,970
- She's a fine-looking woman.
- Get away from me.

222
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:57,609
Joey. Kenny. Good to see you.

223
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:00,333
I've got your desk set up.
Come with me.

224
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:07,206
- My flight was fine.
- We're in a bit of a mode.

225
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,250
We should just do business.

226
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:13,326
This is the White House.
I wouldn't expect candy and flowers.

227
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:16,491
Excuse me.
Joey, these are from Leo McGarry.

228
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:19,042
Let him know if you need anything.

229
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,723
That's so sweet.
Thank him for me.

230
00:15:21,893 --> 00:15:23,770
Did you have a good flight?

231
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,611
Go back to your office.

232
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:28,886
They're carnations.

233
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:33,604
Your desk. You got a phone,
a computer, you got access to a staff.

234
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:37,891
Women like to personalize their desk
with flowers and lotion...

235
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:41,329
...but I prefer the place
to be professional.

236
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,885
Your staff likes to decorate
their desks with hand lotion?

237
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:50,531
Some of them might. We don't do that
on my side of the building.

238
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:55,289
I'm going back to this meeting,
then I'll brief you on what I need.

239
00:16:00,853 --> 00:16:04,323
I'm not sleeping
with Al Kiefer anymore.

240
00:16:06,653 --> 00:16:08,530
- Come here.
- Can I help you?

241
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,769
- Yes.
- How?

242
00:16:10,933 --> 00:16:12,889
By coming here.

243
00:16:16,693 --> 00:16:20,971
This is a place where solemn
work is done. This is a place--

244
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,849
This is not a place
where one's personal things...

245
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:29,083
...where things among people--

246
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:32,563
This is a place where work is done,
nothing else.

247
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,923
You bet.

248
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,644
Nice suit.

249
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:41,086
I'll be back.

250
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:43,444
Josh, I misspoke last night.

251
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:48,562
I said the president wasn't obligated
to nominate a Democrat and Republican.

252
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:50,963
- It turns out he is.
- Oh, C.J.

253
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,249
From the White House Counsel?

254
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,051
- You're sure?
- About what?

255
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,443
You said he nominated them both...

256
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:01,367
...even though he was under
no legal obligation to do so.

257
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:07,009
- You'll fix it at the briefing?
- Yeah.

258
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,289
Don't worry about it.

259
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:21,290
The AMA says addiction is a disease.

260
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:24,286
You're not gonna be able to sell that.

261
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:27,013
- Why does he have to sell it?
- Because.

262
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:29,733
Drug addiction is a medical problem.

263
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,361
It can be treated. It's science.

264
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,093
It's science to you.

265
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:38,131
Science is science to everybody, Al.

266
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:39,642
What'd I miss?

267
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:42,805
Toby says science is science
to everyone.

268
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:48,087
I believe that science is science.
I just don't think you can sell that.

269
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:51,330
While Al thinks of something
easier to sell...

270
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:54,127
...may I speak to Toby and Leo?

271
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:55,931
Go.

272
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:05,485
Joey Lucas says
she's not with Kiefer anymore.

273
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,524
That's a load off our minds.

274
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:10,685
C.J. misspoke last night
during her briefing.

275
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:13,003
- She'll fix it.
- What did she say?

276
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:17,445
The president wasn't obligated to
nominate a Democrat and Republican.

277
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,846
- He is obligated.
- She knows that now.

278
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:25,370
- This is a dumb mistake we don't need.
- She knows that too.

279
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:28,727
What will you do?

280
00:18:28,893 --> 00:18:31,282
- How's it going?
- Sam's just starting.

281
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:34,490
- You talk to him about the thing yet?
- No.

282
00:18:35,453 --> 00:18:37,125
- Me?
- Yeah. Listen.

283
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,403
- Go to a meeting.
- With who?

284
00:18:39,573 --> 00:18:42,610
A Democrat who has a voice
on campaign finance.

285
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,606
If she was on the Ethics Committee...

286
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:48,367
...she could answer Leo's questions.

287
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:52,648
I was married to someone like that.

288
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:57,329
- I set up lunch for the two of you.
- You set up a date with my ex-wife?

289
00:18:57,493 --> 00:19:01,327
Say we won't ask Democrats
to unilaterally drop soft money.

290
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:05,611
- Make that clear.
- And take her temperature on ethics.

291
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,563
Okay.

292
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:12,682
See you later.

293
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:20,371
- Leo, you had to send flowers?
- It's a nice thing to do.

294
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:24,532
I had this whole patter thing going,
and then....

295
00:19:25,493 --> 00:19:26,846
The hell with it.

296
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,925
- Margaret!
- Yes?

297
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,651
The names I gave you.

298
00:19:31,813 --> 00:19:34,930
Dalton, Foxworthy,
Morgenthau, Sugarbaker--

299
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:38,324
- You didn't need to memorize.
- I couldn't help it.

300
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:42,566
Call their offices. I want one
representative apiece at 2:00.

301
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:45,247
- In the office?
- Press briefing room.

302
00:19:47,373 --> 00:19:52,527
- What do those seven have in common?
- Don't worry about it.

303
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:11,488
- I see you're all settled in.
- Yes.

304
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:14,247
Looks good.
Not too many personal items.

305
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,847
Got your little clock.
That's fine.

306
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,362
Here it is.

307
00:20:18,573 --> 00:20:23,203
The president is naming two finance
reform-minded nominees to the FEC.

308
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:27,730
This will anger the Republican
leadership and they'll retaliate.

309
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:31,962
They'll draft bills to put us
on the wrong side of debates.

310
00:20:32,173 --> 00:20:35,802
The first will be a law making
English the national language.

311
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:39,283
I know this. I've worked on it
since Toby called me.

312
00:20:44,253 --> 00:20:45,572
Lunchtime.

313
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:57,206
Over 30% of the federal
prison population...

314
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,968
...are nonviolent first-timers
in jail for drug crimes.

315
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:04,762
At a cost for those prisoners alone
of $2 million a day.

316
00:21:04,933 --> 00:21:07,401
We can sell the public on the idea...

317
00:21:07,573 --> 00:21:10,804
...that $2 million a day
can be put to better use.

318
00:21:10,973 --> 00:21:12,770
- Not for treatment.
- Yes.

319
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:15,806
If we show treatment
prevents substance abuse.

320
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:19,608
If you can get people to sit still
to hear that argument.

321
00:21:19,813 --> 00:21:23,931
"Just say no" takes less time.
Anyone else is soft on crime.

322
00:21:24,093 --> 00:21:26,129
- The AMA.
- Can't sell it!

323
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,971
Can't sell science.

324
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:31,091
I'm hungry.
Nobody has convinced me of anything.

325
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:34,051
Let's eat lunch
and meet here in an hour.

326
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,408
- How's it going?
- It's still early.

327
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,292
- What do you want for lunch?
- Good question.

328
00:21:50,453 --> 00:21:52,967
I could have turkey.
I could have fish.

329
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,523
- Want to look at the menus?
- Fish never hurt anyone.

330
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:02,328
There was an OMB meeting downstairs.
I wanted to see you.

331
00:22:02,493 --> 00:22:05,371
Is this about the FEC nominees?
You want Josh.

332
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,763
- I was hoping we could talk.
- Josh.

333
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:09,161
Josh isn't himself.

334
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:14,970
- "Shove it up your ass"?
- That sounds exactly like Josh to me.

335
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:20,088
- My boss wants to burn the building.
- I'm sure that's against the law.

336
00:22:20,293 --> 00:22:24,206
- Sam, I'm serious.
- This isn't my thing. Go see Josh.

337
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:26,005
- You gonna eat?
- What?

338
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:28,846
- Lunch. You gonna eat?
- Yeah, at my desk.

339
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,322
- What are we having?
- Turkey.

340
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,849
Get two.

341
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:37,364
- It's a beautiful day.
- Yes.

342
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,602
This is nice. It's like a picnic.

343
00:22:41,773 --> 00:22:45,448
There are restaurants,
indoors, with waiters and tables.

344
00:22:46,173 --> 00:22:49,165
- You should sit next to me.
- I'm wearing a suit.

345
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:52,445
- So am I.
- I'm a responsible adult.

346
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:56,808
- I'm a member of Congress.
- I rest my case.

347
00:22:58,573 --> 00:23:01,770
You know what I got? I got pie.

348
00:23:04,013 --> 00:23:06,083
Toby, I've got really good pie.

349
00:23:06,813 --> 00:23:09,486
- It's homemade.
- You baked a pie?

350
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,607
No, I didn't mean I made it
in my home.

351
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,923
Let's go.

352
00:23:16,653 --> 00:23:20,043
- It was baked by a constituent.
- You trust it?

353
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:24,491
I was hoping you'd eat it first.
Wanna talk about the FEC?

354
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,565
He won't ask anyone
to give up soft money.

355
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:30,042
You'll hear from Stadler and Ross.

356
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:33,683
McCovey, Lester, Brock.
Probably Klesko, Trask.

357
00:23:33,853 --> 00:23:36,606
Ritchie.
Will we have your people in line?

358
00:23:36,773 --> 00:23:38,650
- Yeah.
- What about drugs?

359
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,885
That's different.
Mandatory minimums are racist.

360
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,248
One step at a time. Treatments.

361
00:23:44,413 --> 00:23:47,086
I won't talk about mandatory minimums.

362
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:50,290
Sentencing Commission's
proposals for cocaine--

363
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:52,250
This is what happens.

364
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:56,884
I say I won't talk about minimums,
and we talk about them anyway.

365
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:59,931
You won't let me
make decisions for myself...

366
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:02,766
...and deciding for myself
is my birthright.

367
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:08,287
- Good to get it off your chest, poky?
- Yes.

368
00:24:11,373 --> 00:24:15,412
- Problems with what Leo's doing?
- No. But I want to be there.

369
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,370
Why?

370
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:20,252
- Just for fun.
- It's not fun, Andy.

371
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,646
Not everything is fun.

372
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:30,683
You can be there,
but this is a serious thing.

373
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:35,927
Can I bring my pie? It's serious.
There might not be food.

374
00:24:36,093 --> 00:24:38,527
Walk faster.
I don't like the outdoors.

375
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:41,332
We'll have to confirm your nominees.

376
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,405
They're too qualified
not to confirm.

377
00:24:44,573 --> 00:24:45,688
That's a problem.

378
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:49,607
- There's no political cover.
- I understood what you meant.

379
00:24:49,773 --> 00:24:52,970
- My question is--
- The FEC nominees aren't my thing.

380
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about drugs.

381
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,689
- You're gearing up new drug policy.
- For 14 months.

382
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:03,283
Now you're taking
daylong strategy sessions.

383
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:06,445
- Drugs are important to you.
- To everyone.

384
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:10,089
Particularly you.
You're point man at the White House.

385
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:14,411
Why do you want to trade it in
for a move on campaign finance?

386
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:16,404
I'm not trading it in.

387
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,922
- You are.
- We're not bartering.

388
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:23,405
I'm saying without the FEC
nominations, there's room to work.

389
00:25:23,613 --> 00:25:24,728
And with them?

390
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:29,609
Have all the sessions you want.
No one will take your phone call.

391
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:31,365
You can write speeches...

392
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:36,687
...for when the president meets the
Girl Scout who sold the most cupcakes.

393
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:40,570
- Cookies.
- Huh?

394
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:43,123
They sell cookies, not cupcakes.

395
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,763
And it was a good speech I wrote.
About volunteerism.

396
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:49,766
- Keep up the good work.
- I will.

397
00:25:53,453 --> 00:25:54,602
- Leo?
- Yeah.

398
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:58,812
- I was coming to see you.
- Your people are in the briefing room.

399
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:02,966
Carol has the press in the lobby.
She'll wait for your sign.

400
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:07,610
We're telling anyone who asks
that it's a special event.

401
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:11,402
- I don't know if you heard--
- Yeah, I did hear, C.J.

402
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:14,610
Should I tell you how many ways
that was stupid?

403
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,812
For one thing, don't pass yourself
off as a legal authority.

404
00:26:18,973 --> 00:26:22,409
And why use a phrase like,
"Under no legal obligation"?

405
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,848
- You're parsing your words--
- I know.

406
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:29,768
Right away, we gotta go back.
Amateur mistakes make me crazy.

407
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,766
That was bush league.

408
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:39,124
- Bush league, what you did last night.
- My office.

409
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:41,682
- Not the press room?
- There's a meeting.

410
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:43,172
It's the press room.

411
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,888
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Carol.

412
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,403
Don't talk to me like that.

413
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:52,723
I just got called "amateur" twice.

414
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:55,851
The chief of staff can do it,
you can't.

415
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,811
- I need access for my job.
- With your--

416
00:26:58,973 --> 00:27:00,804
- You think I'm kidding?
- Am I?!

417
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:02,725
- The memo was news.
- Says you.

418
00:27:02,893 --> 00:27:07,125
Says me, says my editor,
says <i>Time,</i> says <i>Newsweek.</i>

419
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,726
You're a movie star.

420
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,361
And you're on the outside looking in.

421
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:13,285
What you don't understand--

422
00:27:13,453 --> 00:27:16,172
I'm not in my freshman year anymore!

423
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,483
I understand more than you think.

424
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,004
C.J.? Leo's on his way in.

425
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:26,372
- What's going on in the press room?
- Special event.

426
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:34,050
Good afternoon.

427
00:27:34,213 --> 00:27:37,523
I'll make this as quick
and direct as I can.

428
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:42,084
- Why are we in the press room?
- Without interruptions, it'll be fast.

429
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:48,293
A debate is about to begin over the
best way to fight the drug problem.

430
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:51,451
We believe money
should be put into treatment.

431
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:55,487
The people you work for think
we should put money into prisons.

432
00:27:55,693 --> 00:27:57,649
Is everyone with me so far?

433
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:00,805
Leo, why the seven of us?

434
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,443
Dick, in July of '96,
your boss' son was arrested...

435
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:07,081
...for carrying 25 grams of cocaine.

436
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,245
That's a crime that
usually carries what, Toby?

437
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:12,847
- 15 years.
- What did he get?

438
00:28:13,053 --> 00:28:15,044
Six months house arrest.

439
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:20,052
Lynn, your boss's husband
was caught stealing Vicodin...

440
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:23,683
...from the hospital
where he was chief of surgery.

441
00:28:23,853 --> 00:28:28,529
Vicodin is a Schedule Il drug,
in the same legal category as opium.

442
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:30,012
What's that get?

443
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:33,324
One year in prison per pill
and a monetary fine.

444
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,728
And the congresswoman's husband?

445
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:39,846
Pretrial diversion program,
there's no criminal record.

446
00:28:40,973 --> 00:28:44,443
That's not bad.
Stuart, yours is my favorite.

447
00:28:44,613 --> 00:28:48,970
Your boss's daughter was pulled over
with 31 grams of coke...

448
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:51,522
...and charged with intent to deliver.

449
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:55,527
Moreover, she'd just been
indicted by a federal grand jury...

450
00:28:55,693 --> 00:29:00,209
...along with 18 other people
for conspiracy to distribute. Toby?

451
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:04,565
$2800 fine, and she forfeited
the car in which the drugs were found.

452
00:29:05,893 --> 00:29:08,168
The president wants
a lively debate.

453
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:12,844
He wants to hear opposition,
but he's not gonna stomach hypocrisy.

454
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:17,566
We hear "Soft on crime,
soft on drugs"...

455
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:22,449
...from the people you work for,
we have seven stories for page one.

456
00:29:22,653 --> 00:29:24,689
You're saber-rattling.

457
00:29:25,293 --> 00:29:28,046
Here comes the press corps.
Let's find out.

458
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:33,925
- We're done here.
- We play nine innings at this level.

459
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:36,004
Tell your friends about it.

460
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:40,369
Take your seats, please.
C.J. will start the briefing.

461
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:44,526
Can I tell you something?
Watching you do that, it was fun.

462
00:29:44,693 --> 00:29:47,765
- It was not fun.
- You should've had some pie.

463
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:53,403
I have to get back to work,
and you being a congresswoman...

464
00:29:53,573 --> 00:29:57,885
...I'm sure you need to be
back out there screwing the people.

465
00:29:58,853 --> 00:30:03,324
I should tell you something
in the interest of full disclosure.

466
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,927
The other night,
I was out on a date.

467
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:10,325
We had wine, he pulled the car up,
bumped the guy ahead of us.

468
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:15,726
A cop was gonna give him a BAC test,
but then he recognized me.

469
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:18,450
- Fine.
- I'm just saying.

470
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:22,242
You said, "I'm a member of Congress,
can we fix this?"

471
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:23,402
No.

472
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:28,122
- Who were you out with?
- A guy named Victor Stipe.

473
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,170
Adviser for the Orioles?

474
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:33,843
You went out with the
executive adviser for the Orioles?

475
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:37,452
Are you upset
that I went out on a date?

476
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:43,324
Or that I went on a date with someone
in the same division as the Yankees?

477
00:30:43,493 --> 00:30:45,324
Honest to God,
I'm not sure.

478
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:48,046
Mandatory minimums.

479
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:51,888
Why are you getting into cars
with guys who've been drinking?

480
00:30:52,053 --> 00:30:54,362
I can still do that.

481
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:58,811
- You'd pick me up with a date?
- If he wasn't an Oriole or a Red Sock.

482
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:02,843
In fact, just date the
National League, would you?

483
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:07,965
Toby, I'm not kidding.
Mandatory minimums.

484
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,405
No way.

485
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,928
It's good seeing you.

486
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,006
- Andy?
- Yeah?

487
00:31:20,573 --> 00:31:22,052
Let me have the pie.

488
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:56,008
Mr. President.
Oh, you're in bed?

489
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:57,881
Yeah.

490
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:02,728
- When I called, you were awake.
- Because I answered the phone.

491
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:05,527
I was just coming by to talk.
It can wait.

492
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:07,570
- What's on your mind?
- You sure?

493
00:32:07,773 --> 00:32:12,051
Yeah. I gotta be up
in four hours anyway.

494
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:21,085
What are you doing?

495
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:23,050
FEC. Where's the president?

496
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:26,603
He went to the residence
about an hour ago.

497
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:30,123
I noticed the light
in Joey Lucas' office is on.

498
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:31,931
- She's still here?
- Yeah.

499
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:36,086
- Why are you telling me?
- She's a fine-looking--

500
00:32:36,253 --> 00:32:39,211
- Good night.
- You give her a little something.

501
00:32:39,373 --> 00:32:44,049
"This is for you on your first day."
Give it to her, say something nice.

502
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:46,886
- See you tomorrow.
- Take it easy.

503
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,689
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

504
00:32:52,813 --> 00:32:55,202
- Tell him what you told me.
- I don't--

505
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,125
Tell him what you told me.

506
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:00,410
Steve Onorato
came to see me this afternoon.

507
00:33:02,453 --> 00:33:04,648
- Onorato came to you?
- Tell him.

508
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:08,812
He said if we dropped FEC,
he could warm things up for drugs.

509
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,085
I don't understand.

510
00:33:13,813 --> 00:33:15,565
He said that?

511
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:19,965
He even pointed out that Sam was
working on drugs for the White House.

512
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,806
- You've made the big time, Sam.
- What?

513
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:24,332
He knows about Laurie.

514
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:26,927
- You're friends with a call girl.
- So?

515
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:31,530
He wants to move you to the front
so he can drop Laurie on you.

516
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:33,246
Are you serious?

517
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:39,366
- You haven't done anything wrong.
- I know. Are you serious?

518
00:33:39,573 --> 00:33:42,087
We're serious.
Don't worry about it.

519
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,807
Are you saying he tried
to practice on my--

520
00:33:44,973 --> 00:33:48,124
- Credulous simplicity?
- Yeah.

521
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,329
What can I do right now?

522
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:54,724
No, right now. At 11:35.
I want to know what I can do.

523
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:56,212
- Take it easy.
- No!

524
00:33:56,373 --> 00:34:01,003
I'm gonna call the senator and tell
him to shove his agenda up his ass!

525
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,970
- I did that.
- I'll do it again.

526
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:05,363
This is like <i>The Godfather...</i>

527
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:08,331
...when Pacino says
he's gonna kill the cop.

528
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:11,690
It's a lot like that scene,
only not really.

529
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:16,566
- Did Leo go home?
- He's in the residence.

530
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:21,210
It is like that scene.
I'm James Caan, you're Al Pacino.

531
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:24,092
Toby's the guy who makes
the tomato sauce.

532
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:28,690
- Let's go.
- I'm gonna pick up the late wires.

533
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,489
- Hello.
- Hi.

534
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:46,642
- Kenny.
- Hi, Josh.

535
00:34:46,853 --> 00:34:49,811
I saw the light on.
You guys are here late.

536
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:54,808
I wanted to give you first-look
analysis in the morning.

537
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,846
There's some decent models
in the Bay area.

538
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:01,611
San Jose is a mess.
So is Orange County...

539
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:05,607
- ...Long Beach and San Diego.
- I brought you a coffee mug.

540
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:08,482
Why?

541
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:11,924
Just as a thing, because
you don't know anybody.

542
00:35:12,093 --> 00:35:16,530
It's got a picture of the White House.
It says "the White House."

543
00:35:17,693 --> 00:35:20,207
Seal of the president.

544
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,053
It's a White House coffee mug.

545
00:35:24,893 --> 00:35:26,690
Thank you.

546
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:32,447
- Kenny, can you give us a second?
- Oh, sure. I'm gonna step outside.

547
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,402
I wore this suit special today.

548
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,683
This isn't my regular Tuesday suit.

549
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:50,242
You have a regular Tuesday suit?

550
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:51,926
No.

551
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:56,402
For me?

552
00:35:57,213 --> 00:35:59,169
Yes.

553
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:08,643
Okay, I gotta go.

554
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,523
I don't want to belabor the point.

555
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:22,846
I do think that this
is understandable.

556
00:36:23,013 --> 00:36:25,891
I feel self-conscious
coming down on drugs...

557
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:30,843
...two months after I announced
I was a recovering drug addict.

558
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:33,402
What do you think?

559
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,649
- About what?
- What I just said.

560
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:40,362
I wasn't listening to a lot of it.

561
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:44,128
If there's anyone qualified
to talk about the benefits...

562
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:48,002
...of treatment versus
criminal action, it's you.

563
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:53,770
Would anyone's life be better if
you'd gone to jail instead of rehab?

564
00:36:53,933 --> 00:36:56,606
- No.
- Thank you.

565
00:36:56,773 --> 00:36:57,808
Anything else?

566
00:36:58,413 --> 00:36:59,732
Apparently there is.

567
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:03,687
I'm sorry. I heard Leo was here.
I assumed you were awake.

568
00:37:03,853 --> 00:37:06,526
- I am.
- I want to apologize...

569
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:09,446
...for the gaffe at
last night's briefing.

570
00:37:09,613 --> 00:37:12,923
You fixed it, right?
Then let's move on.

571
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,082
I do apologize.

572
00:37:14,293 --> 00:37:19,128
No need, but I accept your apology
and now I'm ready to move on.

573
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,971
- Sir.
- How you doing?

574
00:37:21,173 --> 00:37:23,448
- You were sleeping?
- Not for a while.

575
00:37:23,653 --> 00:37:28,363
Great. Usually you have a hard time
getting to sleep before 2:00.

576
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,450
- Not tonight.
- Gotta feel good.

577
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:33,969
Let me tell you what I want
to happen right now.

578
00:37:34,173 --> 00:37:35,526
Good evening.

579
00:37:35,733 --> 00:37:38,293
Josh walking in the door
wasn't even close.

580
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:40,967
- How you doing?
- Fine. How you doing?

581
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:45,007
Good.
I gave Joey Lucas a coffee mug.

582
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:48,491
She doesn't know anybody,
she's working hard.

583
00:37:48,653 --> 00:37:52,328
She's very committed.
I think I did the right thing.

584
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:57,922
The part I don't understand is, I got
24 armed guards outside my bedroom.

585
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:02,251
After a day of meetings,
are you closer to a decision on drugs?

586
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,007
A day closer.
There'll be more meetings.

587
00:38:05,173 --> 00:38:08,449
In the meantime,
everybody calm down.

588
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:11,650
Leo's got your engines fired
like it's Daytona.

589
00:38:11,813 --> 00:38:13,166
Keep them there.

590
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,245
Guess what.
Mistakes are gonna be made.

591
00:38:16,413 --> 00:38:18,802
Minimize them,
fix them, move on.

592
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:21,089
Kiefer's numbers got you scared?

593
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:23,164
Listen to me.

594
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,325
I have never lost an election
in my life.

595
00:38:26,493 --> 00:38:29,724
We do this right,
people are gonna respond.

596
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:32,282
You all had a good day.

597
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:34,284
We should go,
leave you now.

598
00:38:34,453 --> 00:38:38,082
You should feel free
to do this when my wife is here.

599
00:38:38,253 --> 00:38:41,484
Something has come up,
and I'm hot as a pistol.

600
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:43,884
- Apparently--
- Sam.

601
00:38:45,733 --> 00:38:47,246
We can talk tomorrow.

602
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:49,210
Everybody.

603
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:52,730
Mandy's doing her job.
Let her out of the doghouse.

604
00:38:52,933 --> 00:38:55,367
- That's me.
- She's doing her job. C.J.?

605
00:38:55,573 --> 00:38:58,451
- Yes, sir?
- So was Danny.

606
00:38:58,613 --> 00:38:59,887
Yes, sir.

607
00:39:00,053 --> 00:39:02,521
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. President.

608
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:05,491
- Mr. President.
- We were almost done.

609
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:10,443
I met with
Congresswoman Wyatt today.

610
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:14,805
When you were married, did you
call her Congresswoman Wyatt?

611
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:17,282
No, sir.

612
00:39:17,453 --> 00:39:20,490
Sometimes I call my wife Dr. Bartlet.

613
00:39:20,653 --> 00:39:23,929
No, I call her Andy.
Or Andrea.

614
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:25,685
Okay.

615
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:28,572
- Mandatory minimums.
- You're whipped.

616
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,362
She's talked to you for a year
about mandatory minimums.

617
00:39:32,533 --> 00:39:36,651
You've been saying no,
but we know who wears the pants.

618
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,567
- You call your wife Dr. Bartlet.
- Just for the turn-on.

619
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:46,532
- The thing is, she's right.
- Andy?

620
00:39:46,693 --> 00:39:50,481
Mandatory minimums are higher for
crack than powder cocaine.

621
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:55,289
The majority of crack users are black.
The majority of drug users are white.

622
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:59,168
- The mandatory minimums are racist.
- Yes, they are.

623
00:39:59,373 --> 00:40:02,604
- It should be part of the discussion.
- It will be.

624
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:05,886
Good.

625
00:40:07,213 --> 00:40:09,773
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

626
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:17,129
I'm sleeping better.

627
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:22,765
I dream about a great discussion
with experts and ideas...

628
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:27,768
...and diction and energy,
and honesty.

629
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:34,129
And when I wake up, I think,
"I can sell that."

630
00:40:35,613 --> 00:40:39,242
- Good night, Mr. President.
- Good night.

631
00:41:45,373 --> 00:41:46,362
