1
00:00:14,323 --> 00:00:18,839
Assuming the court erred in allowing
the jury to consider factors...

2
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:23,400
...that were vague or duplicative
in violation of the 8th Amendment...

3
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:27,073
...such error was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt.

4
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:30,520
A stay of execution
of the sentence of death...

5
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:35,359
...presented to the chief justice
and to the court, is denied.

6
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:39,278
The petition for a writ
of certiorari is denied.

7
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:44,039
The petitioner is remanded
to the federal facility in Indiana...

8
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:49,761
...to be executed by lethal injection
Monday morning at 12:01 a.m.

9
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:54,878
- Who's our guy at the White House?
- It's over. We don't have a guy.

10
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,837
- Who can we call right now?
- The switchboard operator.

11
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:01,432
- Who's got the president's ear?
- Nobody.

12
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:04,760
- Sam Seaborn.
- You know Seaborn?

13
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:08,313
- I beat him up in high school.
- You're kidding me.

14
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:12,596
You can call him right now?
He'll take the call?

15
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,839
Let's find out.

16
00:01:17,123 --> 00:01:20,638
- I'm out of here.
- You've gotta see Sam.

17
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,678
- I'll see Sam, then I'm out.
- You gonna behave tonight?

18
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:28,632
It's a bachelor party.
I can drink with the best of them.

19
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:32,882
- You can't drink with any of them.
- I'm in politics, I can.

20
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:36,672
- Your system's sensitive.
- Stop telling people that.

21
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:39,437
Two drinks
and you'll sleep all weekend.

22
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:45,041
It's the first time I've had a chance
to spend the weekend not working.

23
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:49,873
- Are there gonna be strippers?
- No. Men don't like that anymore.

24
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,762
- Men don't like naked women?
- We do.

25
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:56,239
Looking at them with
your friends makes you feel--

26
00:01:56,443 --> 00:02:00,277
- Sleazy?
- Uncomfortable. Sam, what do you need?

27
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:03,515
- I need you to do me a favor.
- On O'Dwyer?

28
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,556
- People wanna know what's going on.
- Who?

29
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:10,273
- Campaign manager named Joey Lucas.
- What's he like?

30
00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:12,838
- I didn't talk to him.
- What favor?

31
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:17,082
- I scheduled a meeting tomorrow.
- Aren't you going sailing?

32
00:02:17,323 --> 00:02:19,518
- How are you gonna--?
- Ten minutes.

33
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,634
- On Saturday?
- You have plans?

34
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:24,562
- I planned on doing nothing.
- Ten minutes.

35
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:29,433
He's gonna be excited to meet you.
Joshua Lyman, deputy chief of staff.

36
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:32,635
- What do I tell him?
- Tell him the truth.

37
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:35,232
- I don't think so.
- What time?

38
00:02:35,443 --> 00:02:38,037
- 10 a.m.
- You have to be here at 10 a.m.

39
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,835
- We have to.
- Why me?

40
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,678
- Because you work for me.
- I have things to do tomorrow.

41
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:45,714
- What things?
- Shopping.

42
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:47,555
- For what?
- Whatever.

43
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:50,317
When it's over, I'll buy you shoes.

44
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:52,161
- Really?
- I'm out of here.

45
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:56,356
- I'm bringing back the cup!
- Stay in the boat this time.

46
00:02:56,563 --> 00:02:57,962
- Okay.
- Good luck.

47
00:02:58,203 --> 00:03:00,671
I got foul-weather gear! See you!

48
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:03,153
- Bonnie, I'm done?
- You're done.

49
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:06,639
I'm gonna be unreachable
for the weekend.

50
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,242
Good.

51
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:11,441
I'm not taking my pager
or my cell phone.

52
00:03:11,643 --> 00:03:12,837
You earned it.

53
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:15,961
Out on the ocean,
cut off from the White House.

54
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:21,038
- It'll be good for you.
- I'll take my pager and my cell phone.

55
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:24,673
No, I'm cutting the cord.
No cell phone or pager.

56
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:28,353
- Sam, you need to relax.
- Yeah.

57
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:31,839
- Have a good weekend.
- You too.

58
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:45,517
Sam Seaborn.

59
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:32,721
- Is he guilty?
- That's not the point.

60
00:04:32,923 --> 00:04:33,912
Is he guilty?

61
00:04:34,163 --> 00:04:39,112
Blackmun went on record. It was
a drug cartel, he killed two kingpins.

62
00:04:39,323 --> 00:04:42,599
- Public service murder?
- These weren't schoolgirls.

63
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:45,681
- He supported the death penalty.
- He reversed.

64
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:49,154
He said, "I no longer
shall tinker with death.

65
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:54,437
I feel obligated to concede that the
death penalty experiment has failed."

66
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:59,194
- Don't quote Harry Blackmun.
- Tell the president he can't run.

67
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,519
He's gotta consider my client.

68
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:06,962
I don't talk to the president that way.
People don't talk to me that way.

69
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:11,481
I got a guy 48 hours away from death.
You're gonna make it personal?

70
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:15,676
- How long you been with the PD's office?
- About two years.

71
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,113
I heard you were at Ross-Lipton.

72
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:19,881
- I was.
- What happened?

73
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:24,474
They gave me a partnership and
a corner office. What do you think?

74
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:27,641
The president's serious
about separation of powers.

75
00:05:27,883 --> 00:05:33,321
The Constitution says he can grant
pardons for offenses against the U.S.

76
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:38,193
- The judicial branch has spoken, so--
- That's what he'll hide behind?

77
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:41,679
He's not hiding.
He's on Air Force One.

78
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:43,276
When does he land?

79
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:46,475
- 9 a.m.
- That's when you'll talk to him?

80
00:05:46,683 --> 00:05:49,072
- I won't, but I'll ask Toby--
- What?

81
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:55,040
I'll pass it up to Toby Ziegler.
But I have to be honest with you--

82
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:57,199
Talk to him in the morning.

83
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:01,078
- Toby will be at temple first thing--
- What temple?

84
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:02,921
- Bobby--
- What temple?

85
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:05,398
- I don't know.
- Know where it is?

86
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:09,039
- I think it's on Delaware.
- Thank you.

87
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,835
- Leo?
- I thought you left.

88
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:31,438
- I came to get my bag.
- What's up?

89
00:06:31,643 --> 00:06:34,077
- They denied the appeal.
- Simon Cruz?

90
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,154
- I thought they--
- Me too.

91
00:06:36,403 --> 00:06:39,839
Our guy said they would send it
to the 6th Circuit.

92
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:43,922
- They denied the appeal, 5-3.
- It wasn't supposed to happen.

93
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:49,356
- We've gotta get Mendoza on the bench.
- If he was, they would've lost 5-4.

94
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:53,761
The execution is scheduled
for 12:01, Monday morning.

95
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:56,278
So, ball's in our court.

96
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,242
I'm not sure
the president wants the ball.

97
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:01,838
That makes two of us.

98
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,032
Have a good weekend.

99
00:07:06,043 --> 00:07:09,433
- You're not gonna--?
- He lands at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

100
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:13,079
- I'll talk it through with him.
- I'll brief Toby.

101
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,751
- Right.
- I'll see you later.

102
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:18,318
- Sam.
- Yeah?

103
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:20,479
- Why Monday?
- What do you mean?

104
00:07:20,723 --> 00:07:23,999
The court denied the appeal,
why not tonight?

105
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:28,162
We don't execute people between
sundown Friday and sundown Sunday.

106
00:07:28,403 --> 00:07:29,961
- Why?
- Hard to believe--

107
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,755
- You're kidding me.
- No.

108
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:36,275
- We don't execute people on the Sabbath.
- No.

109
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:39,281
That's the most bizarre thing
I've heard.

110
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:45,712
You'll find that there's no part
of this discussion that isn't bizarre.

111
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,835
I'm gonna go.
I got a race in the morning.

112
00:07:49,043 --> 00:07:52,638
- Hold on to a rope or something.
- Yeah.

113
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,996
Damn it.

114
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:46,162
Josh?

115
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,841
Josh?

116
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:52,556
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

117
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:55,880
- What?
- Did you spend the night here?

118
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,553
- No, a couple of hours.
- The party went till morning?

119
00:08:59,803 --> 00:09:02,636
- Yep.
- Why didn't you go home?

120
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:08,637
- What?
- Why didn't you go home?

121
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:13,121
I couldn't find my keys.
Or remember where I lived.

122
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:17,233
I think there might
have been strippers there.

123
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:20,634
Oh, my God!
What happened to your clothes?

124
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:22,760
- I wrinkled my suit.
- Josh!

125
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:27,281
- You wanna speak very softly.
- How did you get like this?

126
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:32,034
- People were pouring champagne.
- And then wrestling in dirt?

127
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:36,031
I can't remember,
but it's not out of the question.

128
00:09:37,723 --> 00:09:43,434
- You have a meeting.
- Yeah, I know. I'm not, you know....

129
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:49,276
- What was the meeting again?
- Joey Lucas about O'Dwyer.

130
00:09:49,483 --> 00:09:53,078
- Josh, you can't wear those clothes.
- I'm fine.

131
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:57,635
- They're the only clothes I got.
- I'll find some other clothes.

132
00:09:57,843 --> 00:10:00,755
- You'll listen from now on?
- I'm not listening now.

133
00:10:00,963 --> 00:10:05,878
- I said, are you gonna--?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

134
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,239
- C.J.
- Don't start with me.

135
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,241
I was being entertaining
and instructive.

136
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:19,442
I'm no longer belted down
next to the passenger from hell.

137
00:10:19,643 --> 00:10:22,237
- Welcome back.
- What're you doing here?

138
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:24,633
- How was the flight?
- Gruesome.

139
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:29,792
We got a history of the fjords,
then we got a quiz on the fjords.

140
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:33,837
You know how much I want
to drop-kick you into a fjord?

141
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,200
- You don't know how to have fun.
- It was quite a trip.

142
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,042
It's not over yet.

143
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,872
- Josh, here.
- What's that?

144
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:02,842
- Sam's foul-weather gear.
- Coffee?

145
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:05,637
It's strong. Drink it all.

146
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:09,112
It's from yesterday,
it might not be hot.

147
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:12,121
- What time's he coming?
- 40 minutes.

148
00:11:12,843 --> 00:11:15,516
- I'm not wearing that.
- One-hour cleaners.

149
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:19,159
- He'll be here in 40 minutes.
- Zuzu'll do it in 30.

150
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:22,520
- Who's Zuzu?
- The guy from the dry cleaners.

151
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,442
- His name is Zuzu?
- Change your clothes.

152
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,238
I'll look like the Gorton's fisherman
in this thing.

153
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,077
With Passover on the horizon...

154
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:41,237
...millions of Jews will gather
around Seder tables.

155
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:46,642
We'll sing our songs
and ask our questions...

156
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:52,236
...about the stick that beat the dog
that bit the cat that ate the kid.

157
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:57,642
We'll sing to entertain our children
and to be reminded by the Haggadah...

158
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:04,038
...the simple truth.
That violence begets violence.

159
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:09,838
Vengeance is not Jewish.

160
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:16,563
- Sam Seaborn.
- What do you want?

161
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,441
I'm at temple right now.

162
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:23,876
By any chance, is your rabbi giving
a sermon on capital punishment?

163
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:28,235
No matter how deep our desire
to witness the suffering of enemies...

164
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:32,436
...we are commanded
to relocate our humanity.

165
00:12:32,683 --> 00:12:35,675
Vengeance is not Jewish.
We are commanded to....

166
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,437
Yeah, he is.
How did you know that?

167
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:41,834
- I'll explain when you get here.
<i>- Why am I coming?</i>

168
00:12:42,043 --> 00:12:46,241
- The appeal was denied.
- All right, I'm on my way.

169
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:56,159
Are you the jackass who has
the DNC choking up funding...

170
00:12:56,363 --> 00:12:59,002
...for the O'Dwyer campaign
in the 46th?

171
00:12:59,203 --> 00:13:02,513
- What in God's name is happening?
- I'm Joey Lucas.

172
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:08,038
- You're Joey Lucas?
- No, I'm Joey Lucas.

173
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,632
Help me, because I don't--

174
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:15,035
You idiot, I'm Joey Lucas!

175
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:20,761
- Okay. I'm Josh Lyman.
- I know who you are.

176
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:24,035
- You're Joey Lucas?
- What were you expecting?

177
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,438
- A man.
- I'm a woman.

178
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:29,077
You're O'Dwyer's campaign manager?

179
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:32,559
Yes, and I have three sources,
two at the DNC--

180
00:13:32,763 --> 00:13:35,914
- What the hell are you wearing?
- Me?

181
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:40,639
- Yes.
- I spilled some things on my clothes.

182
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:44,802
Let's take a deep breath
while I try and remember...

183
00:13:45,003 --> 00:13:48,154
...you know, where I am right now.

184
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:51,594
- Are you drunk?
- I have a very delicate system.

185
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:56,722
I'm serious. I'm trying
to get a guy elected to Congress.

186
00:13:56,923 --> 00:14:01,041
I wanna know why the White House
is screwing around with me.

187
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:02,722
- Excuse me.
- Thank God.

188
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:06,239
- What's going on?
- This is my assistant, Donna.

189
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:09,833
- Donna, Joey Lucas.
- Hi.

190
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:13,956
I'm just gonna go--
I'm gonna go change my clothes.

191
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,279
I'll be right back.

192
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:20,318
- Took you long enough.
- I got stuck.

193
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:24,152
- You know how dumb I looked?
- Joey Lucas is a woman?

194
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:26,075
- Yes.
- And she's deaf?

195
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,075
- Cool.
- Give me that.

196
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:31,042
- You need to see Sam.
- What's Sam doing here?

197
00:14:31,243 --> 00:14:35,156
- The appeal was denied.
- What are you talking about?

198
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,797
All he said was, the appeal's denied.

199
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:41,996
Oh, man. Make sure
they're gonna be okay in there.

200
00:14:42,203 --> 00:14:44,637
This might take a few minutes.

201
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:48,359
Are you saying my rabbi
wrote a sermon just for me?

202
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:52,835
- How'd he know what was going on?
- Public defender, Bobby Zane--

203
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:58,071
A public defender spoke to my rabbi?
How did he know where I go to temple?

204
00:14:58,283 --> 00:15:00,843
I thought they'd send it
to the 6th Circuit.

205
00:15:01,043 --> 00:15:02,192
I thought so too.

206
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,041
- Where's president?
- Home.

207
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,234
- We getting a briefing?
- Yes.

208
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,280
- When's the execution?
- Sunday.

209
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,474
- Monday, 12:01.
- Tomorrow.

210
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:13,595
- Lethal injection?
- Did you sleep in a dumpster?

211
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:17,352
- Possibly. Why aren't you sailing?
- I stayed.

212
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,600
Evidence of capital punishment
as a deterrent?

213
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:21,997
Speculative.

214
00:15:22,203 --> 00:15:26,481
- What are the stats on executions?
- '63 was the last execution.

215
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,038
- Who commuted the sentence?
- Lincoln.

216
00:15:29,243 --> 00:15:31,359
- Abraham?
- No, Burt Lincoln.

217
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,791
I'm surprised.

218
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:37,440
I don't wanna debate on the
death penalty. Let's get stuff ready.

219
00:15:37,643 --> 00:15:41,716
- I'm gonna start working with C.J.
- I gotta get back too.

220
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:45,040
Joey Lucas is waiting
for me in my office.

221
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:48,519
- What's he like?
- He's got very nice legs.

222
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:51,641
- He's a woman?
- Yes, he is. He's also deaf.

223
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:55,040
And very pissed. I'll be right back.

224
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,834
Sam?

225
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:06,392
There's room to give the president
judicial cover if he wants to commute.

226
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:11,472
This guy was convicted
of three murders by a Mexican court.

227
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:15,921
The trial judge let the prosecutor
introduce the evidence.

228
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:18,079
Mexican courts are ridiculous--

229
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:23,357
- How did he know I was at that temple?
- He didn't have great legal counsel.

230
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,753
- How did he know?
- I told him.

231
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:29,035
- You told him.
- Yeah.

232
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:32,321
What are you doing
giving out that inform--?

233
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:35,674
At that moment,
it seemed like what I should do.

234
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:41,043
- He's not gonna commute the sentence.
- We don't know what he's gonna do.

235
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:45,600
- It seemed like what you should do?
- Yeah.

236
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:47,634
Okay.

237
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:55,074
So anyway, he was tried
and found guilty four years ago...

238
00:16:55,323 --> 00:17:00,556
...in the district court in Michigan.
The 6th Circuit turned down his appeal.

239
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:05,274
The Supreme Court gave him a stay,
heard the case, turned him down.

240
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:09,072
- We need Mendoza on the bench.
- Your problem's today.

241
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:12,076
- Why is it my problem?
- As opposed to who?

242
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,599
- Governor of Michigan.
- Why isn't it a state crime?

243
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:19,034
It was prosecuted
under the Drug Kingpin Law...

244
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:22,519
...that was modified
into the Omnibus Crime Bill.

245
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:25,715
Allows the death penalty
in drug-related homicides.

246
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:29,956
The deputy AG's office
is putting together a briefing.

247
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,994
- How long?
- About an hour.

248
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,478
- Okay, I'll wait for that.
- Yeah.

249
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:39,114
- I'm gonna wanna see our people.
- Everyone's here or on the way.

250
00:17:39,323 --> 00:17:43,714
- I'm not gonna be good at this.
- You'll be joining a big club.

251
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:45,436
Yeah. Charlie!

252
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:47,634
- I'll call you.
- Thank you.

253
00:17:47,843 --> 00:17:49,674
Thank you.

254
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:51,111
Yes, sir?

255
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:54,633
There's a priest in Hanover,
Thomas Cavanaugh.

256
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:59,871
I'd like to arrange to have him
come down and see me this weekend.

257
00:18:00,123 --> 00:18:03,798
It's important the White House
not pay for this.

258
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:06,198
And I'm going to....

259
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:11,918
- I'm sorry, sir?
- No, no. Never mind.

260
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:15,718
Yeah. I'm gonna wanna talk
to the pope.

261
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,397
I'm gonna ask you a question.

262
00:18:18,603 --> 00:18:24,075
It's okay to tell me I've crossed
the line and I should shut my mouth.

263
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:27,081
What happened to the guy
who shot your mother?

264
00:18:27,283 --> 00:18:29,194
They haven't found him yet.

265
00:18:29,403 --> 00:18:32,839
If they did, would you
want to see him executed?

266
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:38,443
Killing a police officer is a capital
crime. You must have thought about it.

267
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:39,871
And?

268
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:43,719
I wouldn't want to see him executed,
Mr. President.

269
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,442
I'd want to do it myself.

270
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:53,434
Yeah.

271
00:18:55,523 --> 00:18:57,912
I'll get started
on these arrangements.

272
00:18:58,123 --> 00:19:01,638
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

273
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:14,315
I'm running a campaign
against a conservative Republican.

274
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:18,516
He opposed gay rights, abortion
and gun control.

275
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:24,116
He supports amending the Bill of Rights
to prohibit burning an American flag.

276
00:19:24,323 --> 00:19:29,238
We have a chance to beat him. Why
is the DNC cutting down my funding?

277
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:32,435
- Because you have a chance.
- Excuse me?

278
00:19:32,643 --> 00:19:37,273
- Your campaign is doing way too well.
- Are you deranged?

279
00:19:37,483 --> 00:19:41,476
He's a preposterous figure.
We wanna keep him where he is.

280
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,078
As a poster boy for the radical right?

281
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:48,362
When he comes out with a
declaration about "brown people"...

282
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,636
...the DNC makes it a mail campaign.
He's good for $2 million.

283
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,880
- I wanna speak to the president.
- No problem.

284
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,072
I'm serious.

285
00:19:57,283 --> 00:20:01,276
He doesn't take meetings
on this level. I don't either.

286
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:03,678
What level is that?

287
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:07,438
You should be afraid.
I can create problems for you.

288
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:12,159
- I'm not hearing party loyalty.
- Maybe if your head wasn't so far--

289
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:16,720
- I wanna speak to the president!
- Lunatic, trust me when I say...

290
00:20:16,923 --> 00:20:19,721
...that there is no way
you're gonna see him!

291
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:22,033
Hey, Josh.

292
00:20:22,523 --> 00:20:25,481
- Hello, Mr. President.
- How are you?

293
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:29,033
- I'd like this day to be over.
- Who are your friends?

294
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,677
- This is Joey Lucas.
- How are you?

295
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:33,641
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

296
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:36,033
- This is Kenny Somebody.
- Thurman.

297
00:20:36,283 --> 00:20:41,073
- We were just finishing up.
- I was wandering the halls, thinking.

298
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:44,798
I'll show these people off
and I can wander with you.

299
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:47,961
- You ever seen the White House?
- No, sir.

300
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:52,562
- Let's take a walk. Come on.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:56,354
I need biographical information
on Simon Cruz.

302
00:20:56,563 --> 00:20:58,155
- C-R-U-Z?
- Don't know.

303
00:20:58,403 --> 00:21:01,952
- What information?
- We need to spell his name right.

304
00:21:02,163 --> 00:21:04,233
- Do you read lips?
- Yes, sir.

305
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:06,553
- Joey?
- Yes, sir.

306
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:10,472
- Is that short for Joanne?
- Josephine.

307
00:21:10,723 --> 00:21:13,476
- Your last name is Lucas?
- Yes, sir.

308
00:21:13,723 --> 00:21:16,954
- Is that Polish?
- Dutch.

309
00:21:17,163 --> 00:21:20,155
- Protestant?
- Quaker.

310
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:23,361
Well, this is the Oval Office.

311
00:21:26,963 --> 00:21:30,512
Come in, please. Sit down.

312
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:40,152
- Where did you go to school?
- UCLA and Stanford.

313
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:46,202
There's a guy named Cruz on death row.
He's gonna be executed in 36 hours.

314
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:48,758
What do you think I should do?

315
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:54,760
- Stay the execution.
- Why?

316
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:57,040
The state shouldn't kill.

317
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:01,361
He was found guilty of
a double murder and drug trafficking.

318
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,599
Send him to prison.

319
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:06,676
- You're against capital punishment?
- Yes, sir.

320
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:10,000
- Did you study St. Augustine?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:22:10,243 --> 00:22:12,279
- Thomas Aquinas?
- Yes, sir.

322
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:17,159
Two smart guys, right? They believed
in the Old Testament, which said:

323
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:21,561
"Who sheddeth a man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

324
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:26,518
Immanuel Kant said that the death
penalty is a categorical imperative.

325
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:29,396
But those writings are
from other centuries.

326
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:34,916
A Harris poll says 71% of American
people support capital punishment.

327
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:39,321
- That's a political problem.
- I'm a politician.

328
00:22:41,523 --> 00:22:44,435
Thank you, Mr. President.
We should....

329
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:48,074
Excuse me?

330
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:53,114
I'm here because I'm running the
campaign for O'Dwyer who's running--

331
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:55,393
For the California 46th.

332
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,958
O'Dwyer's an empty shirt.

333
00:22:58,163 --> 00:23:02,361
I don't like guys who run
because they think it's a good gig.

334
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:05,202
Find a live one
and I'll get interested.

335
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:10,073
The devil you know beats the devil
you don't. I like the devil I got.

336
00:23:10,283 --> 00:23:12,956
Josh will take care of you from here.

337
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,638
We're going. Nice meeting you.

338
00:23:20,883 --> 00:23:23,841
- Nice to meet you.
- That was me saying that.

339
00:23:24,043 --> 00:23:26,762
You didn't have
a good time meeting me?

340
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:31,360
You know what?
I actually know that sign.

341
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:36,755
Don't know that one,
but I can probably guess.

342
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:47,962
I just wanna go through
this piece a few times.

343
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:55,959
- Rabbi Glassman.
- Toby.

344
00:23:56,163 --> 00:23:59,360
I didn't hear you,
which is fairly unusual.

345
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:04,156
You missed the end
of my sermon yesterday.

346
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:08,481
I had to go back to my office
and I think you know why.

347
00:24:08,723 --> 00:24:12,432
Bobby Zane called Friday,
told me what was happening.

348
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:15,675
He asked if I had any influence
on Toby Ziegler.

349
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:20,758
I told him, clearly he hadn't
spent any time with Toby Ziegler.

350
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:28,514
She's practicing a piece
for a funeral service in the morning.

351
00:24:28,723 --> 00:24:31,237
- That's funny.
- What?

352
00:24:31,443 --> 00:24:36,039
- I never imagined them practicing.
- Day and night.

353
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:41,954
You and Zane, what were you expecting
when you gave your sermon yesterday?

354
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:48,551
There was hope you might take the
Sabbath day to consider your position.

355
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:54,321
As communications director,
I'm a counselor to the president.

356
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:58,277
But my role in these situations
is generally....

357
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:04,440
I create a public face for what--
I don't influence policy.

358
00:25:04,643 --> 00:25:06,042
Of course you do.

359
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:09,713
You want me to say,
"Vengeance is not Jewish?"

360
00:25:09,923 --> 00:25:13,472
- Why not?
- Well, neither is the president.

361
00:25:13,683 --> 00:25:18,632
The Catholic church's position on life
is no abortion, no death penalty.

362
00:25:18,843 --> 00:25:20,196
I spent the day--

363
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:23,355
Hoping the president
wouldn't call the pope.

364
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,552
Damn right.

365
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:29,593
If he commuted the sentence after that,
the fears of every non-Catholic...

366
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:31,993
...would be realized.

367
00:25:32,243 --> 00:25:37,636
Congratulations, you may now join
the White House communications staff.

368
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:43,952
You look like you're having a long
weekend. I appreciate you stopping by.

369
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:48,159
Yeah. Well, you're welcome.

370
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:52,553
The Torah doesn't prohibit
capital punishment.

371
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:55,352
- No.
- It says, an eye for an eye.

372
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:57,554
You know what it also says?

373
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:01,273
It says a rebellious child
can be stoned to death.

374
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:05,396
It says homosexuality is
an abomination, punishable by death.

375
00:26:05,603 --> 00:26:10,154
It says men can be polygamous
and slavery is acceptable.

376
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:15,756
For all I know, that thinking
reflected the best wisdom of its time.

377
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:20,753
But it's just plain wrong
by any modern standard.

378
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:25,997
Society has a right to protect itself,
but not to be vengeful.

379
00:26:26,203 --> 00:26:31,561
It has a right to punish,
but it doesn't have a right to kill.

380
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:37,752
You know what I think?
You knew I was coming back here.

381
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:41,160
And I think you put her there
on purpose.

382
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:44,753
She's our communications director.

383
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:47,801
Yeah. Anyway....

384
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,160
- Shalom, Toby.
- Shalom, Rabbi.

385
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:05,957
- C.J.? You have everything you need?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:06,163 --> 00:27:08,358
I mean, for a briefing?

387
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:13,956
I have this biographical information.
His mother's name is Sophia. Sophia.

388
00:27:14,163 --> 00:27:17,553
- You're gonna need more than that.
- I have more.

389
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,277
Okay.

390
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:23,357
You know, I have no position
on capital punishment.

391
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,037
Been trying to get
worked up about it...

392
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:30,593
...but the truth is,
I don't care if Cruz dies.

393
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:34,995
If it brings comfort to the families
of the victims, why not?

394
00:27:35,243 --> 00:27:36,471
That's valid.

395
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:41,154
So here's my job tonight,
if this thing happens.

396
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:45,513
- At 12:01, he'll get the injection--
- C.J.

397
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,033
No, I'm saying,
I'm reading it right here.

398
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:52,519
The first sign of death
will be his hands twitching.

399
00:27:52,723 --> 00:27:55,840
After 60 seconds,
he'll strain against the straps.

400
00:27:56,083 --> 00:28:01,441
His head will snap back violently.
90 seconds, he'll be in convulsions.

401
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:05,562
At 12:04, he'll be pronounced dead.

402
00:28:06,763 --> 00:28:10,756
He killed two people. Probably more.

403
00:28:12,043 --> 00:28:16,480
- Sorry I don't get worked up over it.
- Me neither.

404
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:21,193
Except at 12:04...

405
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:26,358
...because that's when the warden
calls me. That's my job tonight.

406
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:32,752
I have to tell the president he's dead
and we're the ones who killed him.

407
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:40,199
So, I just wish I didn't know
his mother's name was Sophia...

408
00:28:40,443 --> 00:28:42,513
...is all I'm saying.

409
00:28:48,123 --> 00:28:49,954
Okay.

410
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,962
Mr. President? Toby's here.

411
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:11,034
Okay.

412
00:29:12,523 --> 00:29:15,401
- Good afternoon. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

413
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:19,602
- How was your trip?
- Fine. What do you need?

414
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:22,271
I had a strange experience
this weekend.

415
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:27,637
A PD on the Cruz case, trying the
things you do when you're desperate...

416
00:29:27,843 --> 00:29:30,198
...he went and spoke to my rabbi.

417
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:33,520
- Jewish law doesn't prohibit--
- I know.

418
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:37,511
The commandment does not say,
"Thou shalt not kill."

419
00:29:37,723 --> 00:29:42,751
I know. But the fact is that
even 2000 years ago...

420
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:49,272
...the rabbis of the Talmud
couldn't stomach it.

421
00:29:49,523 --> 00:29:51,991
They weren't about
to rewrite the Torah...

422
00:29:52,243 --> 00:29:55,201
...but they came up
with legal restrictions...

423
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:58,958
...which make our criminal
justice system look....

424
00:30:00,763 --> 00:30:04,358
They made it impossible
for the state...

425
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:08,201
...to punish someone by killing them.

426
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:12,436
- We make it very hard to kill anybody.
- Should be impossible.

427
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:15,555
- But it's not.
- But it should be.

428
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,121
Hey, what's going on?

429
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:26,158
Toby went to shul.

430
00:30:29,323 --> 00:30:33,521
Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President.

431
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:43,472
Japan opened huge.
Up two cents against the yen.

432
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:48,877
I commute him for no reason other than
I don't like the death penalty...

433
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:54,396
...and the next president sees it
differently, I've laid track to all--

434
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:57,601
The next guy will have
8th Amendment problems.

435
00:30:57,843 --> 00:30:59,799
If that's the only thing....

436
00:31:00,003 --> 00:31:05,361
We cannot execute some people
and not others depending on the mood.

437
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,201
It's cruel and unusual.

438
00:31:07,403 --> 00:31:13,160
If that's the only thing stopping you,
then I'll say this for the first time:

439
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:16,959
Let that be the next guy's problem.

440
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:24,715
- Sir, Sam Seaborn.
- Give me a minute, please, Nancy.

441
00:31:28,843 --> 00:31:32,153
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

442
00:31:32,843 --> 00:31:35,994
The U.S. is 1 of 5 countries
that puts to death...

443
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:39,081
...people under 18
when they commit a crime.

444
00:31:39,323 --> 00:31:40,756
- Nigeria.
- Pakistan.

445
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:45,400
- Saudi Arabia and Iran?
- So that's a list we want to be on.

446
00:31:45,643 --> 00:31:48,555
- I put my notes together--
- Walk with me.

447
00:31:48,763 --> 00:31:51,197
- I was--
- You're not gonna see him.

448
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,673
- Leo.
- He's done.

449
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:56,995
- We have six hours.
- He's done.

450
00:31:57,243 --> 00:32:01,202
- It's not an impossible sell.
- I've lived longer than you.

451
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:05,681
He's done and this was bungled.
We were totally unprepared.

452
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:09,393
This was supposed to go back
to the 6th Circuit.

453
00:32:09,643 --> 00:32:12,441
What are you talking about?
The court sat!

454
00:32:12,643 --> 00:32:16,033
- What would you have done different?
- I'd have....

455
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:19,758
Keep the president out of the country
another two days?

456
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:23,354
Yes.

457
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:31,753
Leo, there are times
when we are absolutely nowhere.

458
00:33:09,323 --> 00:33:14,477
- Thank you for meeting me.
- Our flight's in one hour.

459
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:17,760
Aren't you impressed
I tracked you down?

460
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,555
- Was it hard?
- Very.

461
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:23,802
I had to have my assistant call
your office in California.

462
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,558
When I say it out loud,
it doesn't sound that impressive.

463
00:33:27,803 --> 00:33:30,601
Did you make me meet you here
for jokes?

464
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:33,198
I came at the request
of the president.

465
00:33:33,403 --> 00:33:37,874
He felt that he was rude to you
in the Oval Office yesterday.

466
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:44,431
He apologizes, and while the tightening
of funding was political strategy...

467
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:47,635
...he feels that your candidate
is a schmuck...

468
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,960
...who gives liberalism a bad name.

469
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:56,552
Yeah, I think so too.

470
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,996
I know you do.
Why are you working for him?

471
00:34:00,243 --> 00:34:02,916
I'm a professional
political operative.

472
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:07,480
There's not exactly a seller's market
for deaf campaign managers.

473
00:34:07,723 --> 00:34:09,759
I'd imagine.

474
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:14,401
He wanted me to say
he meant what he said.

475
00:34:14,643 --> 00:34:18,238
Come up with a live one
and we'll get interested.

476
00:34:18,443 --> 00:34:21,196
- Did he have any suggestions?
- He did.

477
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,554
Who?

478
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:25,795
You.

479
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:36,555
You guys have a nice flight back.

480
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:08,120
Mr. President?

481
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:12,315
- Excuse me, Mr. President?
- Yeah?

482
00:35:12,523 --> 00:35:16,152
- Father Cavanaugh.
- Thank you.

483
00:35:19,643 --> 00:35:23,158
- Tom.
- Mr. President.

484
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:25,758
Thank you, Charlie.

485
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,762
- Thanks for coming.
- It was no trouble.

486
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:35,320
- Sorry I couldn't get here until now.
- Seems like a wasted trip.

487
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:38,401
- I can see the Oval Office.
- This is it.

488
00:35:38,643 --> 00:35:42,397
- Show me around the room.
- You're looking at the room.

489
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:46,636
- Where's the red phone?
- We don't use a red phone anymore.

490
00:35:46,843 --> 00:35:51,553
- How do you talk to the Kremlin?
- I tell Mrs. Landingham.

491
00:35:51,763 --> 00:35:54,755
- Would you like a drink?
- No. No, thanks.

492
00:35:55,523 --> 00:36:01,439
I don't know how to address you.
Would you prefer Jed or Mr. President?

493
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,759
- I prefer Mr. President.
- Fine.

494
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:06,158
- Understand why?
- Do I need to?

495
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,513
- It's not ego.
- I didn't think so.

496
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:13,160
The decisions I make in this room,
do I send troops into harm's way?

497
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:17,038
Which fatal disease gets
the most research money?

498
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:22,835
It's helpful not to think of yourself
as the man, but as the office.

499
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:26,353
Then Mr. President it is.

500
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:33,792
I had people on my staff
search for a reason...

501
00:36:34,043 --> 00:36:37,956
...the public would find palatable
to commute the sentence.

502
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:42,600
A technicality.
Any evidence of racism.

503
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:47,521
So your staff spent the weekend
looking for a way out?

504
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:52,353
Like the kid in right field who doesn't
want the ball to get hit to him?

505
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:59,039
I'm the leader of a democracy. 71% of
the people support capital punishment.

506
00:36:59,243 --> 00:37:02,235
The people have spoken,
the courts have spoken.

507
00:37:02,483 --> 00:37:05,555
Did you call the pope?
And how do you do that?

508
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:09,312
For crying out loud,
I say, "Somebody get me the pope."

509
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:13,357
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but I was thinking....

510
00:37:13,963 --> 00:37:20,118
You're just this kid from my parish,
and now you're calling the pope.

511
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:25,802
Anyway, I looked for a way out.
I really did.

512
00:37:26,003 --> 00:37:31,600
"Vengeance is mine," sayeth the Lord.
You know what that means?

513
00:37:31,803 --> 00:37:35,762
God is the only one
who gets to kill people.

514
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,879
- I know.
- That was your way out.

515
00:37:40,963 --> 00:37:42,635
I know.

516
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,641
- Did you pray?
- I did, Tom.

517
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:51,320
- Hard to believe, I prayed for wisdom.
- And none came?

518
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:57,120
It never has. And I'm a little
pissed off about that.

519
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:03,559
I'm not kidding.

520
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:05,922
You know....

521
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,679
You remind me of the man
that lived by the river.

522
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:15,792
He heard a radio report that
the river was gonna flood the town.

523
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:19,154
And that residents
should evacuate their homes.

524
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:25,359
But the man said, "I'm religious, I
pray. God loves me, God will save me."

525
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:30,154
The waters rose up.
A guy in a rowboat came and shouted:

526
00:38:30,363 --> 00:38:34,993
"Hey, you! The town is flooding!
Let me take you to safety!"

527
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:41,842
The man shouted back, "I'm religious.
I pray. God loves me. He'll save me."

528
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:47,481
A helicopter was hovering overhead
and a guy with a megaphone shouted:

529
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:51,955
"Hey, you! You down there!
The town is flooding!

530
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:54,433
I'll take you to safety!"

531
00:38:54,683 --> 00:38:58,596
The man shouted that he was religious,
that he prayed...

532
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:02,153
...and that God would
take him to safety.

533
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:07,562
Well, the man drowned.

534
00:39:08,923 --> 00:39:15,078
Standing at the gates of St. Peter,
he demanded an audience with God.

535
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:20,960
"Lord," he said,
"I'm a religious man, I pray.

536
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:25,634
I thought you loved me.
Why did this happen?"

537
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:32,359
God said, "I sent you a radio report,
a helicopter and a guy in a rowboat.

538
00:39:32,563 --> 00:39:35,123
What the hell are you doing here?"

539
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:43,882
He sent you a priest, a rabbi...

540
00:39:44,123 --> 00:39:47,559
...and a Quaker, Mr. President.

541
00:39:47,763 --> 00:39:53,918
Not to mention his son, Jesus Christ.
What do you want from him?

542
00:39:58,123 --> 00:40:00,159
Excuse me.

543
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:45,356
Jed, would you like me
to hear your confession?

544
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:48,836
Yes, please.

545
00:41:08,163 --> 00:41:11,553
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

546
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:53,392
