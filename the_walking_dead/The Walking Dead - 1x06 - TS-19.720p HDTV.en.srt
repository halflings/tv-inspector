1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,500
Previously on AMC the Walking Dead.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,010
You girls were the first people...

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,500
that I cared anything for.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,490
Jenner here.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,390
63 days since the disease abruptly went global.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,290
My husband...He is alive.

7
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,500
He's my best friend.

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,980
Do you think I'm not happy about that?

9
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,520
We're heading to the C.D.C.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,800
If there's anything left, it's got to be there, don't you think?

11
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,020
Walkers!

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,620
You're killing us!

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,310
Ma'am. Ma'am, please.

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,210
- Please, can you help me? - No no!

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,740
Check them all. Check them all.

16
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,170
Okay.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,270
I'm gonna get you out of here, bud.

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,170
Okay. Okay.

19
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,860
What do I do?

20
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,930
Come on, corporal. Move out!

21
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,220
Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up, I need you to do it now.

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,540
Okay? Now.

23
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,480
Please, man, just show me a sign. Anything.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,650
Please, Rick.

25
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,960
The place is coming down!

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,430
Fall back! All units fall back.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,880
I'm...

28
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm okay.

29
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,260
Daryl, you cover the back.

30
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,160
Hello?

31
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,030
- Hello? - Watch those doors.

32
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,230
Watch for walkers.

33
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,050
Hello?

34
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,690
Anybody infected?

35
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
One of our group was.

36
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,450
He didn't make it.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,180
Why are you here? What do you want?

38
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,890
A chance.

39
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,560
That's asking an awful lot these days.

40
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,940
I know.

41
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,970
You all submit to a blood test.

42
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,510
That's the price of admission.

43
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,450
We can do that.

44
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,630
You got stuff to bring in, you do it now.

45
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,320
Once this door closes, it stays closed.

46
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,430
Vi, seal the main entrance.

47
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,400
Kill the power up here.

48
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,870
Rick Grimes.

49
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,670
Dr. Edwin Jenner.

50
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,850
Doctors always go around packing heat like that?

51
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,150
There were plenty left lying around. I familiarized myself.

52
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,590
But you look harmless enough.

53
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,010
Except you.

54
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,620
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

55
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,270
Are we underground?

56
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you claustrophobic?

57
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,800
- A little. - Try not to think about it.

58
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,720
Vi, bring up the lights in the big room.

59
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,630
Welcome to zone 5.

60
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,360
Where is everybody?

61
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,360
The other doctors, the staff?

62
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I'm it.

63
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,070
It's just me here.

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,470
What about the person you were speaking with?

65
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,110
Vi?

66
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,540
Vi, say hello to our guests.

67
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,910
Tell them... welcome.

68
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,650
Hello, guests. Welcome.

69
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm all that's left.

70
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,900
What's the point? If we were infected,

72
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,700
we'd all be running a fever.

73
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,330
I've already broken every rule in the book letting you in here.

74
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
Let me just at least be thorough.

75
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,910
All done.

76
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,470
Are you okay?

77
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,770
She hasn't eaten in days.

78
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,920
None of us have.

79
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,050
Fine.

80
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,560
You know, in Italy,

81
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,220
children have a little bit of wine with dinner.

82
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,820
And in France.

83
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,620
Well, when Carl is in Italy or France,

84
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,290
- he can have some then. - What's it gonna hurt? Come on.

85
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,130
Come on.

86
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,370
What?

87
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,030
There you are, young lad.

88
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,280
That's my boy. That's my boy.

89
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,880
- Good boy. - Yuck.

90
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,110
That tastes nasty.

91
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,550
Well, just stick to sour pop there, bud.

92
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,550
- Not you, Glenn. - What?

93
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,700
Keep drinking, little man.

94
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,420
I want to see how red your face can get.

95
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,140
It seems to me we haven't thanked our host properly.

96
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,230
He is more than just our host.

97
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,430
- Hear hear! - Here's to you, doc. Booyah!

98
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,090
- Booyah! - Thank you!

99
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,570
Booyah!

100
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,530
So when are you gonna tell us what the hell happened here, doc?

101
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,720
All the-- the other doctors

102
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,740
that were supposed to be figuring out what happened.

103
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,380
- Where are they? - We're celebrating, Shane.

104
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,920
Don't need to do this now.

105
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,160
Whoa, wait a second. This is why we're here, right?

106
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,200
This was your move--

107
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,830
supposed to find all the answers.

108
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,700
Instead we--

109
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,070
we found him.

110
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,930
Found one man. Why?

111
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,750
Well, when things got bad,

112
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,770
a lot of people just left.

113
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,240
Went off to be with their families.

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,170
And when things got worse,

115
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,310
when the military cordon got overrun,

116
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,070
the rest bolted.

117
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,590
Every last one?

118
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,750
No, many couldn't face walking out the door.

119
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,960
They... opted out.

120
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,040
There was a rash of suicides.

121
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,920
That was a bad time.

122
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,770
You didn't leave.

123
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,640
Why?

124
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,640
I just kept working.

125
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,030
Hoping to do some good.

126
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,010
Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man.

127
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,480
Most of the facility is powered down

128
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,060
Including housing, so you'll have to make do here.

129
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,120
The couches are comfortable,

130
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,490
But there are cots in storage if you like.

131
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,800
There's a rec room down the hall that you kids might enjoy.

132
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,800
Just don't plug in the video games, okay?

133
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,670
or anything that draws power. The same applies--

134
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
If you shower, go easy on the hot water.

135
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,210
Hot water?

136
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,980
That's what the man said. -

137
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,680
Andrea?

138
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,360
That's it.

139
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,850
That's it. Get it out.

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,450
There you go.

141
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,630
Oh... god.

142
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,510
Everything's gone.

143
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,000
It's always better going down than coming up, huh?

144
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,240
I don't mean the wine, Dale.

145
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,550
You know, it's over. There's nothing left.

146
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,220
Don't you see that?

147
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,050
Oh, I-- I see a--

148
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,060
A chance to make a new start.

149
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Oh my god, Dale.

150
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,100
Dale, didn't you see the look on Jenner's face?

151
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,330
Hear what I'm saying.

152
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,130
There's nothing left.

153
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,010
How's the blood?

154
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,220
No surprises.

155
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,120
I came to thank you.

156
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,400
You did.

157
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,970
You all-- you all right?

158
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,600
You don't know what it's like.

159
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
You don't know what it's like out there.

160
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,570
You may think you do, but you don't.

161
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,210
We'd have died out there.

162
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,750
It was only a matter of time.

163
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,720
There's too many of those things.

164
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,860
My-- my boy...

165
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,180
My-- my wife, I never--

166
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,000
I never told 'em what I really thought.

167
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I never even hinted, just--

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,610
Just kept it in.

169
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,250
Kept it in and kept us moving, you know.

170
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,580
Just kept it in. Kept us...

171
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,220
It'll all be okay.

172
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,790
It'll be okay.

173
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,700
Any good books?

174
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,680
Enough to keep us busy for years.

175
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,710
All right. Come on, kids, it's bedtime.

176
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,520
Baby, go say your prayers. I'm gonna browse a bit.

177
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,520
Come on.

178
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,410
This is the first night we might actually get some real sleep.

179
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,560
It's a miracle, isn't it?

180
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,260
Jesus, you scared me.

181
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm gonna tell you a few things

182
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,540
And you're gonna listen to me.

183
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,110
Now is not the time.

184
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,620
Come on. When is it ever the time?

185
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,790
How can you treat me like this?

186
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,620
- You're kidding, right? - No. Huh-uh.

187
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,700
Because you told me my husband was dead.

188
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,890
I didn't lie to you, all right? I didn't.

189
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,260
Do you know what it was like there?

190
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,560
Stop. Things were falling apart.

191
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,470
They were slaughtering people in the hallways.

192
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,390
It was a massacre. There were walkers everywhere.

193
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,490
- So you left him? - Everybody else ran.

194
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,780
There were no doctors there. It was just me.

195
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,580
He was hooked up to machines and I did not know what to do.

196
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,210
I even took my ear and I put it on his chest

197
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,610
And I listened for a heartbeat and I did not hear one.

198
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,150
And I-I-I-I-- I don't know why.

199
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,050
Maybe it was gunfire. I don't know what it was,

200
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,260
But there was no way he could've survived that. No way.

201
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,620
- He did. - Yeah, but then I had y'all to think about, didn't I?

202
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,340
I had you and Carl,

203
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,760
- and I needed to think about-- - okay. No no.

204
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,300
I had to get you guys safe to Atlanta.

205
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,830
That's what I had to do. Just stop.

206
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,430
If you thought for one second

207
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,960
that he was still alive, would you have come?

208
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,930
So I saved your life--

209
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,480
You and your little boy's. That's what I did.

210
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,140
Right?

211
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,710
Okay.

212
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,010
And if I could've traded places with him, I would have.

213
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,550
I would trade places with him right now because--

214
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,890
No no no, you--

215
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,350
- I love you. Shh shh. - No. No, you're drunk.

216
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,080
- I love you. - No, you're drunk.

217
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,260
And I know there were some things that say that you love me too.

218
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,130
Because there's no way that

219
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,630
you could've been with me the way that you were.

220
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,760
Shane. Shane. Shane!

221
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,850
Listen. You love me.

222
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,800
Get your hands off me. Get your hands off me.

223
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,800
- I love you. There's nobody here. - Please! No!

224
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,160
Stop, Lori. It's all right. Just--

225
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,140
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

226
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,370
We're safe here.

227
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,070
All right?

228
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,470
- Morning. - Are you hungover?

229
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,490
- Mom said you'd be. - Mom is right.

230
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,200
Mom has that annoying habit.

231
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,810
Eggs. Powdered, but-- but I do 'em good.

232
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,730
I bet you can't tell.

233
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,480
Protein helps the hangover. -

234
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,200
Where'd all this come from?

235
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,020
- Jenner. - could you help me, please?

236
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,860
He thought we could use it.

237
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,700
- Thank you. - Some of us, at least.

238
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't ever ever ever let me drink again.

239
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,770
Feel as bad as I do?

240
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,570
Worse.

241
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,200
The hell happened to you?

242
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,140
Your neck?

243
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,910
I must have done it in my sleep.

244
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,580
Never seen you do that before.

245
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,550
Me neither.

246
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,910
Not like me at all.

247
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,380
- Morning.  - Hey, doc.

248
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,220
Doctor, I don't mean to slam you with questions first thing--

249
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,130
But you will anyway.

250
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,250
We didn't come here for the eggs.

251
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:34,270
Give me playback of TS-19.

252
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,390
Playback of TS-19.

253
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,590
Few people ever got a chance to see this.

254
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,560
Very few.

255
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,090
- Is that a brain?  - An extraordinary one.

256
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,050
Not that it matters in the end.

257
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,710
Take us in for E.I.V..

258
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,230
Enhanced internal view.

259
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,280
What are those lights?

260
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,190
It's a person's life--

261
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,690
experiences, memories.

262
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,790
It's everything.

263
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,430
Somewhere in all that organic wiring,

264
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,890
All those ripples of light,

265
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,980
is you--

266
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,780
The thing that makes you unique.

267
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,140
And human.

268
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,510
You don't make sense ever?

269
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,040
Those are synapses,

270
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,850
electric impulses in the brain

271
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,850
that carry all the messages.

272
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,650
They determine everything a person says

273
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,690
does or thinks from the moment of birth

274
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,660
to the moment of death.

275
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,920
Death? That's what this is, a vigil?

276
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,620
Yes.

277
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,720
Or rather the playback of the vigil.

278
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,800
This person died?

279
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,680
Who?

280
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,240
Test subject 19.

281
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:19,080
Someone who was bitten and infected...

282
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,610
and volunteered to have us record the process.

283
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,920
Vi, scan forward to the first event.

284
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,280
Scanning to first event. -

285
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,170
What is that?

286
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,540
It invades the brain like meningitis.

287
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,510
The adrenal glands hemorrhage,

288
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,410
the brian goes into shutdown,

289
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,410
then the major organs.

290
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,070
Then death.

291
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,510
Everything you ever were or ever will be...

292
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,770
Gone.

293
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,070
Is that what happened to Jim?

294
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,960
Yes.

295
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,140
She lost somebody two days ago.

296
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,550
Her sister.

297
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,400
I lost somebody too.

298
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,080
I know how devastating it is.

299
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,250
Scan to the second event.

300
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,400
Scanning to second event.

301
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,460
The resurrection times vary wildly.

302
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,490
We had reports of it happening in as little as three minutes.

303
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,440
The longest we heard of was eight hours.

304
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,700
In the case of this patient,

305
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,730
it was two hours, one minute...

306
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,540
Seven seconds.

307
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,410
- It restarts the brain?  - No, just the brain stem.

308
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,960
Basically, it gets them up and moving.

309
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,550
But they're not alive?

310
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,020
You tell me.

311
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,400
It's nothing like before.

312
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,740
Most of that brain is dark.

313
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,570
Dark, lifeless, dead.

314
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,200
The frontal lobe, the neocortex,

315
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,570
The human part-- that doesn't come back.

316
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,430
The you part.

317
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,910
Just a shell driven by mindless instinct.

318
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,090
God. What was that?

319
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,510
He shot his patient in the head.

320
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,750
Didn't you?

321
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,320
Vi, power down the main screen and the workstations.

322
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,540
Powering down main screen and workstations.

323
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,370
You have no idea what it is, do you?

324
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,160
It could be microbial, viral, parasitic, fungal.

325
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,900
Or the wrath of god?

326
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,010
There is that.

327
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,370
Somebody must know something.

328
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,120
Somebody somewhere.

329
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,380
There are others, right? Other facilities?

330
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,790
There may be some.

331
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,030
People like me.

332
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,290
But you don't know? How can you not know?

333
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,790
Everything went down.

334
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,870
Communications, directives-- all of it.

335
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,900
I've been in the dark for almost a month.

336
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,010
So it's not just here.

337
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,810
There's nothing left anywhere? Nothing?

338
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,380
That's what you're really saying, right?

339
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,220
Jesus.

340
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,430
Man, I'm gonna get soon faced drunk again.

341
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,260
Dr. Jenner, I know this has been taxing for you

342
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,460
And I hate to ask one more question, but...

343
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,440
That clock--

344
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,470
It's counting down.

345
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,520
What happens at zero?

346
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,440
The basement generators-- they run out of fuel.

347
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,280
And then?

348
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,850
Vi, what happens when the power runs out?

349
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,120
When the power runs out,

350
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,970
facility-wide decontamination will occur.

351
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Decontamination-- what does that mean?

352
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,550
I don't like the way Jenner clammed up.

353
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,850
The way he just wandered off like that.

354
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,580
What's wrong with him? Seriously, man,

355
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,220
Is he nuts, medicated, what?

356
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,720
In there.

357
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,630
Check that way.

358
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,200
Shane.

359
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,320
It's empty.

360
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,030
- Emergency lighting on. - What the hell is this?

361
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,390
Hey, you guys kill the lights?

362
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,570
- Nah, it just went ou. - Anything?

363
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,200
Yeah, a lot of dead generators

364
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,680
and more empty fuel drums than I can count.

365
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,020
It can't be down to just that one.

366
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,820
Mom? Something wrong?

367
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,150
Nothing. It's just...

368
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,330
the air conditioning stopped.

369
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,750
I did the best I could in the time that I had.

370
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,350
I hope you'd be proud of that.

371
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,440
We always think there's gonna be more time...

372
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,070
...then it runs out.

373
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,420
Why is the air off?

374
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,950
- and the lights in our room? - What's going on?

375
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,550
Why is everything turned off?

376
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,360
Energy use is being prioritized.

377
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,790
Air isn't a priority? And lights?

378
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,020
It's not up to me. Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

379
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,230
Hey! Hey, what the hell does that mean?

380
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,740
Hey man, I'm talking to you.

381
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,400
What do you mean it's shutting itself down?

382
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,170
How can a building do anything?

383
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,710
- You'd be surprised. - Rick?

384
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,510
Jenner, what's happening?

385
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,850
The system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power.

386
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,280
It's designed to keep the

387
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,360
computers running to the last possible second.

388
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,660
That started as we approached the half-hour mark.

389
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,520
Right on schedule.

390
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,710
- It was the French. - what?

391
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,040
They were the last ones to hold out as far as I know.

392
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,600
While our people were bolting out the doors

393
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,180
and committing suicide in the hallways,

394
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,300
they stayed in the labs till the end.

395
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,340
They thought they were close to a solution.

396
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,250
What happened?

397
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,380
The same thing that's happening here.

398
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,890
No power grid.

399
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,230
Ran out of juice.

400
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,600
The world runs on fossil fuel.

401
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,630
I mean, how stupid is that?

402
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,580
- Let me tell you-- - To hell with it, Shane. I don't even care.

403
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,110
Lori, grab our things. Everybody, get your stuff.

404
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,200
We're getting out of here now!

405
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,980
Oh, okay.

406
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,790
What's that?

407
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,910
What's that?

408
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,890
30 minutes to decontamination.

409
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,360
Doc, what's going on here?

410
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,090
Everybody, y'all heard Rick.

411
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,830
Get your stuff and let's go! Go now! Go!

412
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,260
- Let's go. - Come on!

413
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,880
No.

414
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,760
Did you just lock us in?

415
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,840
He just locked us in!

416
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,580
We've hit the 30-minute window. I am recording.

417
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,270
- Carl. - Mom!

418
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,040
- You son of a bitch. - Shane!

419
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,040
- You let us out of here! - No, stop. Don't!

420
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,880
- You lying-- - No no no no!

421
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,720
Wait, no! No, don't do it.

422
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,790
Hey, Jenner, open that door now.

423
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,220
There's no point. Everything topside is locked down.

424
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,730
The emergency exits are sealed.

425
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,230
Well, open the damn things.

426
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,450
That's not something I control. The computers do.

427
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,490
I told you once that front door closed,

428
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,670
it wouldn't open again. You heard me say that.

429
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
- It's better this way. - What is?

430
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,010
What happens in 28 minutes?

431
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,150
- What happens in 28 minutes??! - COME ON!

432
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,680
You know what this place is?!

433
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,190
We protected the public

434
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,990
from very nasty stuff!

435
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,180
Weaponized smallpox!

436
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,440
Ebola strains that could wipe out half the country!

437
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,630
Stuff you don't want getting out! Ever!

438
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,210
In the event of a catastrophic power failure--

439
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,850
in a terrorist attack, for example--

440
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,280
H.I.T.s are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out.

441
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,450
HIT
H.I.T.s?

442
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,100
- Vi, define. - HITs--

443
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,980
high-impulse thermobaric fuel-air explosives

444
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,960
cocoists of a two-stage aerosol ignition

445
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,270
that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power

446
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,690
and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear.

447
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,490
The vacuum-pressure effect ignites the oxygen

448
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,240
between 5,000 and 6,000 degrees

449
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,800
and is used when the greatest loss of life

450
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,420
and damage to structures is desired.

451
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,580
It sets the air on fire.

452
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,120
No pain.

453
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,250
An end to sorrow, grief...

454
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,820
regret.

455
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,030
Everything.

456
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,100
Open the damn door!

457
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,050
Out of my way!

458
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,550
Daryl!

459
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,900
You should've left well enough alone.

460
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,880
- it would've been so much easier. - Easier for who?

461
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,390
All of you. You know what's out there--

462
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,620
A short, brutal life and an agonizing death.

463
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,160
Your-- your sister-- what was her name?

464
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,200
- Amy. - Amy.

465
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,430
You know what this does.

466
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,720
You've seen it.

467
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,780
Is that really what you want for your wife and son?

468
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,360
I don't want this.

469
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,610
Can't make a dent.

470
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,340
Those doors are designed to withstand a rocket launcher.

471
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,400
Well, your head ain't!

472
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,340
Daryl! Daryl!

473
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,150
Just back up! Back up!

474
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,190
You do want this.

475
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,930
Last night you said

476
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,130
you knew it was just a matter of time

477
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,550
before everybody you loved was dead.

478
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,710
What?

479
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,730
What? You really said that?

480
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,360
After all your big talk?

481
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,090
I had to keep hope alive, didn't I?

482
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,860
There is no hope.

483
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,720
- there never was. - There's always hope.

484
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,380
Maybe it won't be you, maybe not here,

485
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,530
But somebody somewhere--

486
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,230
What part of "Everything is gone" Do you not understand?

487
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,630
Listen to your friend. She gets it.

488
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,310
This is what takes us down.

489
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,610
This is our extinction event.

490
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,790
This isn't right.

491
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,280
You can't just keep us here.

492
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,090
One tiny moment--

493
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,090
A millisecond. No pain.

494
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,660
My daughter doesn't deserve to die like this.

495
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,260
Wouldn't it be kinder,

496
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,270
more compassionate to just hold your loved ones

497
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,310
and wait for the clock to run down?

498
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,780
- Shane, no! - out of the way, Rick!

499
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,280
Stay out of my way! Open that door

500
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,090
or I'm gonna blow your head off. Do you hear me?!

501
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,190
Brother, brother, this is not the way you do this.

502
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,690
- We will never get out of here. - Shane, you listen to him.

503
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,030
- It's too late. - He dies, we all--

504
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,160
we all die! Shane!

505
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,640
Shane!

506
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,510
Are you done now? Are you done?

507
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,550
Yeah, I guess we all are.

508
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,710
I think you're lying.

509
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,380
- What? - You're lying.

510
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,080
About no hope.

511
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,610
If that were true, you'd have bolted with the rest

512
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,520
or taken the easy way out. You didn't.

513
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,280
You chose the hard path.

514
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,190
- Why? - It doesn't matter.

515
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,930
It does matter. It always matters.

516
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,380
You stayed when others ran.

517
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,200
- Why? - Not because I wanted to.

518
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,380
I made a promise...

519
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,730
To her.

520
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,970
My wife.

521
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,750
Test subject 19 was your wife?

522
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,980
She begged me to keep going as long as I could.

523
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,420
How could I say no? -

524
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,130
She was dying.

525
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,530
It should've been me on that table.

526
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
I wouldn't have mattered to anybody.

527
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,330
She was a loss to the world.

528
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,200
Hell, she ran this place. I just worked here.

529
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,670
In our field, she was an Einstein.

530
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,340
Me? I'm just... Edwin Jenner.

531
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:00,410
She could've done something about this.

532
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,680
Not me.

533
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,450
Your wife didn't have a choice.

534
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,720
You do. That's-- that's all we want--

535
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,690
A choice, a chance.

536
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,220
Let us keep trying as long as we can.

537
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,570
I told you topside's locked down. I can't open those.

538
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,410
Come on!

539
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,380
- Let's go! - Come on, let's go!

540
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,520
- Come on! - Move it! Move it!

541
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:52,160
- Come on, let's go! - We're gonna get out of here, Sophia.

542
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,900
There's your chance. Take it.

543
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm grateful.

544
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,600
- The day will come when you won't be. - Let's go!

545
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:15,670
Hey, we've got four minutes left! Come on!

546
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,410
- Let's go. Let's go. - No no, I'm staying.

547
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm staying, sweetie.

548
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:22,950
- But that's insane! - no, it's completely sane.

549
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,580
For the first time in a long time.

550
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,750
I'm not ending up like Jim and Amy.

551
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,230
There's no time to argue

552
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,060
and no point, not if you want to get out.

553
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,120
Just get out. Get out.

554
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,630
Dog. Come on, man.

555
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,340
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

556
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,970
I'm staying too.

557
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,880
Andrea, no.

558
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,960
- Just go! Go! - Come on.

559
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,690
Andrea,

560
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,800
This isn't what Amy would want for you.

561
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:16,970
She's dead, and you need to leave.

562
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,070
- Get them doors open! - Come on!

563
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,420
- It doesn't work! - Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

564
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,180
Try it! Try it! Try it now!

565
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,420
- Come on! Come on! - Stay close, sweetheart.

566
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,230
Time's almost up.

567
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,560
Daryl, look out!

568
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,200
Dog, get down! Get down!

569
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,280
- Jesus. - The glass won't break?

570
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,750
Rick, I have something that might help.

571
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,920
Carol, I don't think a nail file's gonna do it.

572
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,910
Your first morning at camp,

573
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,390
when I washed your uniform I found this in your pocket.

574
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,820
Come on.

575
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,390
Look out!

576
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,270
- Get down! Get down! - Shit?

577
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,610
Okay.

578
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,480
You win.

579
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,620
- What are you doing? - I said okay.

580
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,030
- Don't pull this, Dale. - I'm not pulling anything.

581
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,640
If you're staying, I stay too.

582
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,800
He's right. We know what's waiting for us out there.

583
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,900
I don't want to face it alone.

584
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,880
Dale, get the hell out.

585
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,280
I don't want you here.

586
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,290
Too bad. See, you don't get to do that,

587
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,330
to-- to come into somebody's life,

588
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,120
make them care and then just check out.

589
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,690
I'm staying.

590
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,630
The matter is settled.

591
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,060
Wait wait wait. Wait wait.

592
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:08,590
They're coming.

593
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,170
They got out.

594
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,990
Come on.

595
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,960
Dale, get down! Down!

596
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:48,700
Get back! Everybody down! Down!

597
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,510
Get down!

598
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,860
Come on. Come on.

599
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,510
Come on. Come on. Get in, get in, get in.

600
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,260
Get in!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
