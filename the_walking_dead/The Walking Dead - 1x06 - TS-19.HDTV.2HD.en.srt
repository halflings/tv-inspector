to the moment of death.

324
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,715
Death? That's what
this is, a vigil?

325
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,417
Yes.

326
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:11,522
Or rather the playback
of the vigil.

327
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,591
This person died?

328
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,461
Who?

329
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,030
<i>Jenner:
Test subject 19.</i>

330
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,701
Someone who was bitten

331
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,869
and infected...

332
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:29,306
And volunteered to have us

333
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,408
record the process.

334
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,714

<i>- Vi: Scanning to first event.
- ( Beeping )</i>

336
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,958
What is that?

337
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,329
It invades the brain
like meningitis.

338
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,300
<i>The adrenal glands
hemorrhage,</i>

339

341
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,876
Then death.

342
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,947
<i>Everything you ever were

343
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,551
<i>Gone.</i>

344
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,854
Is that what happened to Jim?

345
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,756
Yes.

346
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:29,733
<i>Lori: She lost somebody

00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,304
I lost somebody too.

349
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,874
I know how devastating it is.

350
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,047

Jenner: The resurrection
times vary wildly.

353
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,291
We had reports of it happening
in as little as three minutes.

354
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,593
<i>The longest we heard of
was eight hours.</i>

355

<i>In the case
of this patient,</i>

356
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:01,932
it was two hours, one minute...

357
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,335
Seven seconds.

358
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:19,216
- It restarts the brain?
- No, just the brain stem.

359
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,452
Basically,
it gets them up and moving.

360
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,354
But they're not alive?

361
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:27,825
You tell me.

362
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,195
It's nothing like before.

363
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,530
<i>Most of that brain
is dark.</i>

364
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,366
<i>Jenner:
Dark, lifeless, dead.</i>

365
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,001
The frontal lobe,
the neocortex,

366
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:39,369
the human part...
That doesn't come back.

367
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,238
<i>The you part.</i>

368
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,274
<i>Just a shell</i>

369
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,710
<i>driven by

370
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:51,882
God.
What was that?

371
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:55,319
He shot his patient
in the head.

372
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,556
Didn't you?

373
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:01,592
Jenner: Vi, power
down the main screen

374
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,126

You have no idea
what it is, do you?

377
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,572
It could be microbial,

<i>viral, parasitic,</i>

379

<i>- fungal.
- Or the wrath of God?</i>

380
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:24,181
There is that.

381
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:26,183
Andrea: Somebody must know something.

382
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,918
Somebody somewhere.

383
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:31,188
Carol: There are others, right?
Other facilities?

384
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,591
There may be some.

385
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:37,027
People like me.

386
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,062
But you don't know?
How can you not know?

387

<i>Communications,

389
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,702
I've been in the dark
for almost a month.

390
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,804
So it's not just here.

391
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,608
There's nothing left
anywhere? Nothing?

392
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:54,177
That's what you're
really saying, right?

393
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,989
Jesus.

394
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:08,191
Man, I'm gonna get
shit-faced drunk again.

395
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:11,028
Dr. Jenner, I know this
has been taxing for you

396
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:14,231
and I hate to ask
one more question, but...

397
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,200
That clock...

398
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,236
<i>It's counting down.</i>

399
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,273
What happens at zero?

400
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:30,213
The basement generators...
they run out of fuel.

401
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:34,051
And then?

402
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,623
Vi, what happens
when the power runs out?

403

<i>Vi:

406
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,979
Shane: I don't like the
way Jenner clammed up.

407
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,282
The way he just
wandered off like that.

408
00:25:57,316 --> 00:26:00,018
What's wrong with him?
Seriously, man,

409
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:01,653

410
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,156

T-Dog: Yeah, a lot of dead generators

421
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,182
and more empty fuel drums
than I can count.

422
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,520
It can't be down

Something wrong?

00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,838
The air conditioning stopped.

I hope you'd be proud of that.

00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,466
- And the lights in our room?

434

Why is everything turned off?

435
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:31,870
Energy use is
being prioritized.

436
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:34,305
Air isn't a priority?
And lights?

437
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,542
It's not up to me.
Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

Jenner, what's happening?

444
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:58,329
The system is dropping all
the nonessential uses of power.

445
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:01,833
It's designed to keep the computers
running to the last possible second.

446
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,135
That started as we approached
the half-hour mark.

447
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,004
Right on schedule.

448

- It was the French.
- What?

449
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,153
They were the last ones

No power grid.

00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,163
Wait, no!
No, don't do it.

481
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:44,235
Hey, Jenner,
open that door now.

482
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,671
There's no point.
Everything topside is locked down.

483
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:48,172
The emergency exits are sealed.

484
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,674
<i>Well, open the damn things.</i>

485
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,909
That's not something I control.
The computers do.

486
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:54,946
I told you once
that front door closed,

487
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,115
it wouldn't open again.
You heard me say that.

488
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:02,053
- It's better this way.
- What is?

489
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,455
What happens in 28 minutes?

490
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,990
( Keyboard clacks )

491

<i>- What happens in 28 minutes?!

492
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:12,130
You know what this place is?!

493
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,632
We protected the public

494
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,435
from very nasty stuff!

495
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,639
Weaponized smallpox!

496
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,876
Ebola strains that could
wipe out half the country!

497
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,079
Stuff you don't want
getting out! Ever!

498
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:43,661
In the event of a
catastrophic power failure...

499
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,297
in a terrorist attack,
for example...

500
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,734
H.I.T.s are deployed to prevent
any organisms from getting out.

501
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:51,903
H.I.T.s?

502

<i>- Vi, define.

<i>consists of a two-stage

505
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,715
<i>that produces a blast wave

greatest loss of life</i>

511
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,830
<i>and damage
to structures is desired.</i>

512
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:20,998
It sets the air on fire.

513
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:26,537
No pain.

514
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,039
( Both crying )

515
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,675
<i>Jenner:
An end to sorrow, grief...</i>

516

Regret.

517
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:44,455
Everything.

518
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:53,213
Open the damn door!

519
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,750
Out of my way!

520
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,251

( Crying )

523
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,528
You should've
left well enough alone.

524
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:11,531
- It would've been so much easier.
- Easier for who?

525
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,533
All of you.
You know what's out there...

526
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:17,537
<i>A short, brutal life
and an agonizing death.</i>

527
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:21,841
Your... your sister...

528
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,543
<i>- Amy.
- Jenner: Amy.</i>

529

You know what this does.

530
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,047
You've seen it.

531
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,449
Is that really what you want
for your wife and son?

532
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,684
<i>( Emphatically )
I don't want this.</i>

<i>- ( Axe bangs )
- Can't make a dent.</i>

Those doors are designed to
withstand a rocket launcher.

535
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,725
- Well, your head ain't!
- Whoa! Whoa!

536
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,660
Daryl!
Daryl!

<i>Jenner:
You do want this.</i>

539
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,334
Last night you said

540
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,003
you knew it was just
a matter of time

541
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:51,871
before everybody
you loved was dead.

542
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,040
What?

543
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,044
What?
You really said that?

544
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,679
<i>After all your big talk?</i>

545
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:01,414
I had to keep
hope alive, didn't I?

546
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:03,183
<i>Jenner:
There is no hope.</i>

547
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,351
- There never was.
- There's always hope.

548
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,253
Maybe it won't be you,
maybe not here,

549
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,855
but somebody somewhere...

550
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,624
What part of "everything is
gone" do you not understand?

551
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,027
<i>Jenner: Listen to your friend.
She gets it.</i>

552

This is what takes us down.

553
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:21,000
This is our extinction event.

You can't just keep us here.

557
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,479
One tiny moment...

558
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:34,481
a millisecond.
No pain.

559
00:34:34,515 --> 00:34:38,051
<i>My daughter doesn't deserve
to die like this.</i>

560
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:43,656
Wouldn't it be kinder,

561
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:47,160
more compassionate
to just hold your loved ones

562
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:50,497
- and wait for the clock to run down?
- ( Gun cocks )

- Shane, no!
- Out of the way, Rick!

564
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,667
Stay out of my way!
Open that door

565
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,469
or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Do you hear me?!

566
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,572
Brother, brother, this is
not the way you do this.

567
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:02,075
- We will never get out of here.
- Shane, you listen to him.

Are you done now?
Are you done?

574
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,935
Yeah, I guess we all are.

575
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:53,092
I think you're lying.

576

<i>- What?
- Rick: You're lying</i>

577

about no hope.

578
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,002
If that were true, you'd
have bolted with the rest

579
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,905
or taken the easy way out.
You didn't.

<i>You chose
the hard path.</i>

<i>- Why?

It does matter.
It always matters.

583

You stayed when others ran.

- Why?
- Not because I wanted to.

585
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:22,755
I made a promise...

586
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,125
To her.

Test subject 19 was your wife?

- How could I say no?
- ( Pounding )

It should've been me
on that table.

593

Not me.

600

Your wife didn't have a choice.

You do. That's...

Carol, I don't think
a nail file's gonna do it.

643
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,253
Your first morning at camp,

when I washed your uniform
I found this in your pocket.

Come on.

Okay.

You win.

652
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:59,966
- What are you doing?
- I said okay.

653

- Don't pull this, Dale.
- I'm not pulling anything.

If you're staying, I stay too.

Dale, get the hell out.

658

I don't want you here.

659
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:21,621
Too bad.
See, you don't get to do that,

660
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:23,789
to... to come into
somebody's life,

661
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,459
make them care
and then just check out.

662
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:34,033
I'm staying.

663
