1
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:29,159
Little girl?

2
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,525
I'm a policeman.

3
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:34,303
Little girl.

4
00:03:39,098 --> 00:03:40,328
Don't be afraid.

5
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:45,332
Little girl.

6
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:58,246
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>resync by Doomxknight</font>

7
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:01,547
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,003
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

9
00:05:05,576 --> 00:05:07,671
I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:10,648
They're born thinking in a switch,
it only goes one way.

11
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:11,524
On.

12
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,336
*** blond *** lit room.

13
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,538
I mean every woman, every lady has a ***,
I swear to God.

14
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,035
Come home,

15
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:22,904
house all lit up,

16
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,075
and my job, apparently because...

17
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:28,274
because my chromosomes happen
to be different

18
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,351
cause I then gotta walk through that house,

19
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:33,292
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

20
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,610
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

21
00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:38,407
Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching
to you now, boy.

22
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:42,855
The same chick, mind ya.

23
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,376
She'll bitch about global warming.

24
00:05:47,072 --> 00:05:48,668
That's when Reverend Shane wants to

25
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,921
quote from the Guy Gospel and
say "Um, darling?"

26
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:55,670
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

27
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,547
just figured out that the light switch

28
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,000
see, goes both ways,

29
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,677
"maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

30
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:03,292
- You say that?
- Yeah.

31
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,761
Anyway, uh...

32
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,040
Polite version...

33
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:09,615
Still man, that... that earns me this.

34
00:06:09,735 --> 00:06:12,590
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

35
00:06:13,464 --> 00:06:15,446
And that's when
the exorcist voice pops out.

36
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:18,016
"You sound just like my damn father.

37
00:06:18,558 --> 00:06:21,167
"Always, always yelling about the power bill,

38
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:23,071
"telling me to turn off the damn lights."

39
00:06:23,191 --> 00:06:25,244
- What do you say to that?
- You know what I wanna say.

40
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:29,145
I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me
you've been hearing this your entire life

41
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:32,078
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

42
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:35,353
You know...

43
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:37,563
I don't actually say that, tho.

44
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:40,579
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

45
00:06:40,855 --> 00:06:41,949
the polite version there...

46
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,910
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:50,806
So how's it with Lori, man?

48
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:54,757
She's good.
She's good at turning off lights.

49
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:57,838
Really good. I don't know
why sometimes ***

50
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,040
Not what I meant.

51
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:06,914
- We didn't have a great night.
- Look, man, I may have a...

52
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:10,190
fail to amuse with my sermon,
but I did try.

53
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:13,344
The least you could do is speak.

54
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:20,121
That's what she always says:
"Speak". "Speak".

55
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,053
You think I was the most closed mouth
son of a bitch you'd ever hear to hear her tell it.

56
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,392
Do you express your thoughts?

57
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:33,072
You share your feelings and that kind of stuff?

58
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,417
The thing is...

59
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,315
lately whenever I try...

60
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,647
everything I say makes her impatient,

61
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:46,546
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

62
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,035
It's like she's...

63
00:07:50,078 --> 00:07:52,584
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

64
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,504
Look, man, that's just shit
couples go through.

65
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,530
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

66
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,307
- Last thing she said this morning?
- Mm?

67
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,815
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

68
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,870
She said that in front of our kid.

69
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:17,823
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

70
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:23,826
Difference between men and women?

71
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,373
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

72
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,320
Certainly not in front of Carl.

73
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,395
All available units, high speed
pursuit in progress

74
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:42,508
Lincoln county units
request local assistance.

75
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:47,058
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

76
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:48,574
Proceed with extreme caution.

77
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,277
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

78
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:05,370
Be advised, they have fired
on police officers.

79
00:09:05,489 --> 00:09:07,472
One Lindon county officer is wounded.

80
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,809
Unit 1, Unit 3, please ***.

81
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,361
18, 2 miles west of lnterstate 85
and we'll patch in Lindon County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:28,726
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:33,207
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3, we are 10-97
in code 100.

84
00:09:33,327 --> 00:09:35,887
Highway 18, *** Interstate, please advise.

85
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,491
***

86
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,924
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

87
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:57,945
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

88
00:09:57,984 --> 00:10:00,012
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

89
00:10:00,065 --> 00:10:02,120
What I think, Leon, is that
you need to stay focused.

90
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:04,869
Make sure you got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

91
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,509
Would be kind of cool to get on
one of them shows.

92
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,049
Holy shit.

93
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:28,112
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

94
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,015
Put the gun down!

95
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,885
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

96
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:13,049
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

97
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,040
Me too.

98
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,612
Son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

99
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:20,144
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,412
Yeah.

101
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:27,363
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

102
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,014
You understand... Aah!

103
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,931
Rick! Rick!
No, no, no!

104
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,105
Shh, shh, shh.

105
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:38,498
No, no, no, no...

106
00:12:38,619 --> 00:12:39,654
He's hurt!

107
00:12:40,157 --> 00:12:41,283
***

108
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:44,982
You get that ambulance down here, you tell
them there's an officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,706
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me? Shh, shh. okay.

110
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:53,681
Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:54,743
Shh, shh, ok?

112
00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:56,573
You stay with me, ok?

113
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,049
Hey, bud...

114
00:13:16,892 --> 00:13:18,380
We're still here.

115
00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:20,836
We're still hanging in.

116
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,549
Look, I'm sorry, man.

117
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,157
I'm mean watching the same crap
every time I come in here.

118
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,900
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...

119
00:13:36,664 --> 00:13:38,914
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

120
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,373
They hope you come back real soon.

121
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:48,342
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

122
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:50,649
You probably could tell, hmm?

123
00:13:53,585 --> 00:13:55,703
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?

124
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:08,502
That vase has something special.

125
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:12,250
Fess up. Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

126
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,713
I hope you left her that spoon collection.

127
00:14:24,326 --> 00:14:25,329
Shane?

128
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,480
Shane, you in the john?

129
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,850
Nurse, help.

130
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:53,993
Nurse.

131
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,524
Help!

132
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:45,706
Lori!

133
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,849
Lori!

134
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,386
Carl!

135
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:00,243
Carl!

136
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:09,101
Lori! Carl!

137
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:26,368
Lori! Carl!

138
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:46,484
Is this real?
Am I here?

139
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:55,057
Wake, wake up!

140
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,012
- Daddy, daddy!
- Carl...

141
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,211
Carl?

142
00:26:13,774 --> 00:26:14,704
I found you...

143
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,072
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

144
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,278
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

145
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,971
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

146
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:30,999
Hey, mister!

147
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,166
What's that bandage for?

148
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:37,172
- What?
- What kind of wound?

149
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:40,282
You answer me, damn you!

150
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,371
What's your wound?

151
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,197
You tell me!

152
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:47,433
Or I will kill you.

153
00:27:11,992 --> 00:27:15,398
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.

154
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,026
What was? The wound?

155
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,414
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,333
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:28,003
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:29,971 --> 00:27:32,316
Look, I ask and you answer,

159
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:34,483
It's common courtesy, right?

160
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,777
Did you get bit?

161
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:44,798
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

162
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,426
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.

163
00:27:48,729 --> 00:27:49,930
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:53,072
- Just shot?
- As far as I know.

165
00:27:56,747 --> 00:27:57,612
Hey...

166
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:58,877
Just let me...

167
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:03,919
Feels cooler now.

168
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:06,501
Fever would have killed you by now.

169
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:10,250
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:17,829
Take a moment, eh?

171
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:19,396
Look how sharp it is.

172
00:28:20,435 --> 00:28:22,274
You try anything...

173
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:25,779
I will kill you with it,
and don't you think I won't.

174
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:38,993
Come on up when you're able.

175
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,707
Come on.

176
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:16,890
This place...

177
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,026
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.

178
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,162
Never met them.

179
00:29:22,872 --> 00:29:25,139
I've been here. This is their place

180
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,506
It was empty when we got here.

181
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:31,957
Don't do that.

182
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:33,845
They'll see the light.

183
00:29:34,664 --> 00:29:36,209
There's more of them out there than usual.

184
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,924
I never should have fired that gun today.

185
00:29:40,773 --> 00:29:43,305
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

186
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:47,165
Stupid... using a gun...

187
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:50,114
It all happened so fast...

188
00:29:51,052 --> 00:29:53,863
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

189
00:29:54,762 --> 00:29:55,532
Man?

190
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:58,657
- No man... - What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

191
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:01,610
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

192
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,560
In this street, out front, a man.

193
00:30:03,598 --> 00:30:05,879
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

194
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:07,564
Come on.

195
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:11,315
Sit down, before you fall down.

196
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:14,623
Here. Eat.

197
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,119
Daddy...

198
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:20,285
Blessing...

199
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,331
Yeah.

200
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:38,717
Father, we thank thee for this food...

201
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,125
Thy blessings...

202
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,119
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.

203
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,260
- Amen.
- Amen.

204
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:54,361
Hey, mister, do you even know
what is going on?

205
00:30:54,814 --> 00:30:56,302
I woke up today.

206
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,888
In a hospital.

207
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:02,487
Came home, that's all I know.

208
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:09,336
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

209
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:12,996
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.

210
00:31:13,116 --> 00:31:14,035
No...

211
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,775
Not the one's they put down...

212
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,017
The one's they didn't. The walkers.

213
00:31:19,405 --> 00:31:20,924
Like the one I shot today.

214
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:22,942
Cause he would have ripped into you.

215
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:25,787
Try to eat you, take him
some flesh at least.

216
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:29,419
But I guess if this is the first
you're hearing,

217
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,653
I know how it must sound...

218
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:37,363
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

219
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,723
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

220
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,851
Maybe it's the cool air or...

221
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,304
Hell, maybe it's just me
firing up that gun today.

222
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:48,605
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.

223
00:31:49,193 --> 00:31:51,002
Probably wander off by morning.

224
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:54,594
Well, listen...

225
00:31:56,298 --> 00:31:57,730
One thing I do know...

226
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,946
Don't you get bit!

227
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,234
We saw your bandage
and that's why we were afraid of.

228
00:32:04,553 --> 00:32:05,978
Bites kill you.

229
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,998
The fever... burns you out.

230
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,642
But then after a while...

231
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:12,847
You come back.

232
00:32:19,116 --> 00:32:20,316
Seen it happen...

233
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,146
Come on...

234
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,492
Carl...

235
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,958
He your son?

236
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,816
William..

237
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:43,326
He said his name today...

238
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,374
He's a little younger...

239
00:32:46,877 --> 00:32:47,865
than your boy.

240
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:49,651
And he's with his mother?

241
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,087
I hope so.

242
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,160
- Dad?
- Yeah?

243
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,107
Did you ask him?

244
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,659
Your gun shot...

245
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,186
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a...

246
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,321
bank robber...

247
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:11,969
Yeah...

248
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:16,490
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Kapow.

249
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,838
Sheriff's deputy.

250
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:21,433
Aha.

251
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,141
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

252
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,513
It's nothing.

253
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,047
One of them must've bumped a car...

254
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,544
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

255
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,423
Went off a few minutes.

256
00:33:40,547 --> 00:33:42,024
Get the light, Dwayne.

257
00:33:56,276 --> 00:33:58,201
It's the blue one, down the street.

258
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:00,496
Same one as last time.

259
00:34:01,135 --> 00:34:02,613
I think we're ok.

260
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,006
That noise...

261
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,814
Will it bring more of them?

262
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:10,976
Nothing to do about it now.

263
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:13,966
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.

264
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:20,006
She's here.

265
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,207
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

266
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,776
I said go! Come on!

267
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,717
Come on, quiet.

268
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:39,820
Shh, shh...

269
00:34:58,923 --> 00:35:02,114
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.

270
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,449
Can you remember?

271
00:35:03,846 --> 00:35:05,403
Shh...

272
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:44,800
She, uh...

273
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:50,445
She died in the other room, on that bed...

274
00:35:52,898 --> 00:35:55,882
Nothin' I can do about it here...

275
00:35:56,463 --> 00:35:57,841
That fever, man...

276
00:35:59,406 --> 00:36:01,647
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...

277
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:12,570
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

278
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:15,852
You know what...

279
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:17,686
I just didn't have it in me...

280
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:24,402
She's the mother of my child.

281
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,539
- You sure?
- They're dead.

282
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,658
They have to ask, at least one more time.

283
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:59,727
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.

284
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,890
That's why it's gotta be the head.

285
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,015
You alright?

286
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:31,151
Need a moment?

287
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,270
They're alive.

288
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:39,947
My wife and son.

289
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:41,944
At least they were when they left.

290
00:37:42,065 --> 00:37:43,433
How can you know?

291
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:47,663
- By the look of this place...
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

292
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,942
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.

293
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:51,420
But enough to travel.

294
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:54,901
You know anybody could've broken in here
and stolen clothes, right?

295
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,631
You see the framed photos on the walls?

296
00:37:59,299 --> 00:38:02,461
Neither do I. Some random thief
took those too, you think?

297
00:38:06,678 --> 00:38:09,582
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.

298
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,510
Photo albums...

299
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,619
My wife...

300
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:21,855
Same thing...

301
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:27,149
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

302
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,597
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

303
00:38:34,577 --> 00:38:35,754
That's right.

304
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,557
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

305
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:41,951
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

306
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,455
Military protection, food, shelter...

307
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,556
They told people to go there.

308
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:49,314
Said to be safest.

309
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,437
Plus they got that disease place.

310
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:53,282
Center for Disease Control.

311
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:56,424
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

312
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,521
Gas and light have been down
for maybe a month.

313
00:39:26,979 --> 00:39:29,017
Station got its own propane system.

314
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,239
Pilot's still on.

315
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,217
Oh, my Lord.

316
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:40,104
Hot water!

317
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:42,384
- Whoo!
- That feels good, right?

318
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:54,217
Dwayne...

319
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,124
Dress in room back there.

320
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,455
What you say, Dwayne?

321
00:40:00,418 --> 00:40:01,356
Thank you.

322
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:03,793
Mhm.

323
00:40:07,267 --> 00:40:08,835
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

324
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,598
Safer anyway. People...

325
00:40:13,168 --> 00:40:14,357
That's where we were heading.

326
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:18,137
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.

327
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:19,151
The panic...

328
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:21,816
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

329
00:40:23,993 --> 00:40:25,041
My wife...

330
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,742
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,

331
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,502
so we had to find a place to lay low.

332
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:31,837
And then, after she died...

333
00:40:35,022 --> 00:40:36,505
We just stayed hunkered down.

334
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:41,266
I guess we just froze in place.

335
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:44,442
Plan to move on?

336
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,109
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*)

337
00:40:58,711 --> 00:41:00,230
A lot of it's gone missing.

338
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,158
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

339
00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:04,743
I'm old enough.

340
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,212
Hell yes you're going to learn.

341
00:41:06,332 --> 00:41:08,689
We gotta do it carefully, teach you
to respect the weapon.

342
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,613
That's right. It's not a toy.

343
00:41:10,962 --> 00:41:14,195
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.

344
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:15,247
Yes, sir.

345
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:18,678
Here.

346
00:41:20,362 --> 00:41:21,325
Go on.

347
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:28,032
Take that one.

348
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,357
Nothing fancy.

349
00:41:29,831 --> 00:41:31,272
Scope's accurate.

350
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:49,159
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than
you think. Especially at target practice.

351
00:41:50,692 --> 00:41:51,571
Dwayne.

352
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:53,636
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

353
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,684
You sure you won't come along?

354
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:58,870
A few more days...

355
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,238
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

356
00:42:09,816 --> 00:42:11,044
You got one better.

357
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:14,375
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes
every day at dawn.

358
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,946
You get up there, that's how you find me.

359
00:42:17,607 --> 00:42:19,929
- You think they're here?
- Can't afford not to.

360
00:42:20,242 --> 00:42:22,953
- Not anymore.
- Look, just one thing.

361
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,349
They may not seem
like much one at a time...

362
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,764
but in a group all round up and hungry...

363
00:42:28,385 --> 00:42:30,793
- They you watch your ass.
- You too.

364
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:34,397
You a good man, Rick.

365
00:42:35,007 --> 00:42:36,515
I hope you find your wife and son.

366
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,598
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

367
00:42:41,587 --> 00:42:43,604
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:56,536
Leon Bessi?

369
00:43:00,652 --> 00:43:02,016
Didn't think much of him.

370
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,056
Careless and dumb, but...

371
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:07,098
can't leave him like this.

372
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,231
You know, if they hear the shot..?

373
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,514
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son.

374
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:16,865
Come on.

375
00:44:50,136 --> 00:44:51,872
Read your comic books a while.

376
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:53,721
Daddy'll be upstairs.

377
00:46:55,777 --> 00:46:57,961
- Daddy?
- It's alright, Dwayne.

378
00:46:58,507 --> 00:47:00,768
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

379
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,514
Come on, baby.

380
00:48:02,383 --> 00:48:05,178
I'm sorry this happened to you.

381
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:01,173
Come on, come on.

382
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,522
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

383
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:00,231
We'll be approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

384
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,439
Anybody reads, please respond.

385
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:07,499
Hello. Hello.

386
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,257
Can anybody hear my voice?

387
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:15,536
Anybody out there?
Anybody hears me, please respond.

388
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,464
Hello, can you hear my voice?

389
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,658
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear my voice?

390
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:25,265
Hey? Hello?

391
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:27,405
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes, I can hear you.

392
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,761
You're coming through. Over.

393
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,600
Anybody who reads, please respond.

394
00:50:31,984 --> 00:50:33,839
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

395
00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:37,194
We'll be approaching Atlanta
on Highway 85.

396
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:39,351
Anybody reads, please respond.

397
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:44,202
We're just outside the city.

398
00:50:45,114 --> 00:50:46,033
Damnit.

399
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:47,661
Hello?

400
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:49,177
Hello?

401
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,251
He couldn't hear me. I couldn't warn him.

402
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,292
Try to raise him again.

403
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,704
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

404
00:50:57,685 --> 00:51:00,169
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

405
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:07,295
This is officer Shane Walsh, broadcasting
a person unknown, please respond.

406
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:14,963
He's gone.

407
00:51:17,258 --> 00:51:19,362
There are others. It's not just us.

408
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:22,022
Yeah, We knew there would be, right,
that's why we let the CB on.

409
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:24,276
Lot of good it's been doing.

410
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,478
And I've been saying for a week,
we ought to put signs up on 85

411
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:28,970
to warn people away from the city.

412
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:31,368
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

413
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,318
We don't have enough time.

414
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:36,382
I think we need to make time.

415
00:51:36,777 --> 00:51:38,305
Yeah, that, uh...

416
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:40,408
That's a luxury we can't afford.

417
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:43,244
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

418
00:51:44,445 --> 00:51:46,256
And who the hell would you propose to send?

419
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:48,193
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

420
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,284
Nobody goes anywhere alone, you know that.

421
00:51:55,476 --> 00:51:56,886
Yes, sir.

422
00:51:57,424 --> 00:52:00,817
Hey, hey, hey, come on, take a sit, buddy.
You're alright, go on, you're alright.

423
00:52:05,303 --> 00:52:06,401
What, you're pissed at me?

424
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:11,494
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

425
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:16,868
I'm not putting you in danger, okay?
I'm not doing it for anything.

426
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,784
I make you feel like sometimes you wanna
slap me outside the head...

427
00:52:20,904 --> 00:52:23,507
I'll tell you what, girl. You feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

428
00:52:26,984 --> 00:52:29,314
You cannot walk off like that,

429
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:31,379
all half-cocked.

430
00:52:31,835 --> 00:52:34,632
Look, if you don't wanna do it for
my sake or for your sake, that's fine.

431
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,569
But just...

432
00:52:36,512 --> 00:52:37,575
You do it for him.

433
00:52:39,095 --> 00:52:40,754
That boy has been through too much.

434
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,636
And he's not losing his mother too, ok?

435
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:45,694
Okay.

436
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,107
Ok, fine.

437
00:52:51,988 --> 00:52:53,102
You tell me okay.

438
00:53:00,501 --> 00:53:01,589
It's not hard.

439
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,443
Hey...

440
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:22,400
Mom?

441
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,011
What's up, buddy? She's in there, go on.

442
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:30,898
Hey.

443
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:34,002
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

444
00:53:34,123 --> 00:53:35,066
Okay?

445
00:53:35,852 --> 00:53:39,259
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

446
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:24,346
Hello?

447
00:54:26,533 --> 00:54:28,204
Police officer out here.

448
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,256
Can I borrow some gas?

449
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:42,528
Hello?

450
00:54:48,449 --> 00:54:49,399
Hello?

451
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:51,656
Anybody home?

452
00:56:38,394 --> 00:56:39,850
Easy now, easy.

453
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,461
I'm not gonna hurt you.

454
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,608
Nothing like that.

455
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:47,571
More like a proposal.

456
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:51,027
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

457
00:56:51,147 --> 00:56:52,207
It's safe there.

458
00:56:52,641 --> 00:56:56,971
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

459
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:00,113
How's that sound?

460
00:57:01,557 --> 00:57:03,292
There we go. Good boy.

461
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,384
Good boy. Now come with me.
Come with me.

462
00:57:21,042 --> 00:57:24,846
Let's go easy, ok?
I haven't done this for years.

463
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:35,626
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

464
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:55,316
Let's go.

465
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:51,207
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

466
01:00:01,482 --> 01:00:03,159
Okay, whoa whoa whoa.

467
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:44,798
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

468
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:10,269
Hey, you.

469
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:13,555
Dumb ass.

470
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:17,329
Hey, you in the tank.

471
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:19,247
Cozy in there?

472
