1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:10,379
Previously on AMC's
The Walking Dead...

2
00:00:10,499 --> 00:00:14,265
You girls were the first people
that I cared anything for.

3
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:18,158
Jenner here. 63 days since
the disease abruptly went global.

4
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:23,356
- My husband is alive.
- He's my best friend.

5
00:00:23,476 --> 00:00:25,625
You think I am not happy about that?

6
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:27,315
We're heading to the CDC.

7
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:29,766
If there's anything left,
it's gotta be there, don't you think?

8
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,015
Walkers!

9
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:34,332
You're killing us!

10
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,859
Hey hey.
Whoa whoa.

11
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:47,529
Ma'am.
Ma'am, please.

12
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,431
- Please, can you help me?
- No no!

13
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:53,969
<i>Check them all.
Check them all.</i>

14
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:24,399
<i>Okay.</i>

15
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:26,501
I'm gonna get you
out of here, bud.

16
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,407
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

17
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,084
What do I do?

18
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,158
Come on, corporal.
Move out!

19
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,740
<i>Listen to me. If you're gonna wake
up, I need you to do it now.</i>

20
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,342
<i>Okay? Now.</i>

21
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,711
Please, man, just show me a sign.
Anything.

22
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:12,881
<i>Please, Rick.</i>

23
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,186
The place is coming down!

24
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,655
<i>Fall back!
All units fall back.</i>

25
00:02:34,837 --> 00:02:36,838
I'm...

26
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,710
I'm okay.

27
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:37,622
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by edgez</font>


28
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:07,462
Daryl, you cover the back.

29
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,734
Hello?

30
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:15,236
- Hello?
- Watch those doors.

31
00:04:15,271 --> 00:04:16,438
Watch for walkers.

32
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,246
<i>Hello?</i>

33
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,884
Anybody infected?

34
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,920
One of our group was.

35
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:35,657
He didn't make it.

36
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:38,393
Why are you here?
What do you want?

37
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:41,095
A chance.

38
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,765
That's asking
an awful lot these days.

39
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:47,135
I know.

40
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:00,181
You all submit to a blood test.

41
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,716
That's the price of admission.

42
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,651
We can do that.

43
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:07,355
You got stuff to bring
in, you do it now.

44
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:09,524
Once this door closes,
it stays closed.

45
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,632
Vi, seal the main entrance.

46
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,601
Kill the power up here.

47
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,075
Rick grimes.

48
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,878
Dr. Edwin Jenner.

49
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,050
Doctors always go around
packing heat like that?

50
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,354
There were plenty left lying around.
I familiarized myself.

51
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,791
<i>But you look
harmless enough.</i>

52
00:05:43,826 --> 00:05:45,226
Except you.

53
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,829
<i>I'll have to keep
my eye on you.</i>

54
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,472
Are we underground?

55
00:05:57,506 --> 00:05:59,207
Are you claustrophobic?

56
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:02,010
- A little.
- Try not to think about it.

57
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:09,884
Vi, bring up the lights
in the big room.

58
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:17,792
Welcome to zone 5.

59
00:06:18,827 --> 00:06:20,528
Where is everybody?

60
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:22,530
The other doctors, the staff?

61
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:27,335
I'm it.

62
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:29,237
<i>It's just me here.</i>

63
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:32,640
What about the person
you were speaking with?

64
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:35,276
Vi?

65
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,713
<i>Vi, say hello
to our guests.</i>

66
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:42,083
Tell them...
Welcome.

67
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:44,819
<i>Hello, guests.
Welcome.</i>

68
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,956
I'm all that's left.

69
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,261
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:56,865 --> 00:06:59,434
What's the point?
If we were infected,

71
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,235
we'd all be running a fever.

72
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,505
I've already broken every rule
in the book letting you in here.

73
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,008
Let me just
at least be thorough.

74
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:10,078
<i>All done.</i>

75
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:14,649
<i>- Ooh.
- Are you okay?</i>

76
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:16,951
- Mmm.
- She hasn't eaten in days.

77
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,087
<i>None of us have.</i>

78
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,225
Fine.

79
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:25,727
You know, in Italy,

80
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:29,397
children have a little bit
of wine with dinner.

81
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:30,999
And in France.

82
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,801
Well, when Carl is
in Italy or France,

83
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:36,471
- he can have some then.
- What's it gonna hurt? Come on.

84
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,306
<i>Come on.</i>

85
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,541
What?

86
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,213
There you are, young lad.

87
00:07:48,884 --> 00:07:51,486
<i>Eww.</i>

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,454
That's my boy.
That's my boy.

89
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,058
- Good boy.
- Yuck.

90
00:07:57,092 --> 00:07:59,293
That tastes nasty.

91
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,729
Well, just stick
to sour pop there, bud.

92
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,731
- Not you, Glenn.
- What?

93
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,601
Keep drinking, little man.
I want to see how red your face can get.

94
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,311
It seems to me we haven't
thanked our host properly.

95
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,414
He is more than just our host.

96
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,617
- Hear hear!
- Here's to you, doc. Booyah!

97
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:24,285
<i>- Booyah!
- Thank you!</i>

98
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,754
<i>Booyah!</i>

99
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:29,724
So when are you gonna tell us
what the hell happened here, doc?

100
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:34,896
All the...
the other doctors

101
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,932
<i>that were supposed to be
figuring out what happened,</i>

102
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:40,568
<i>- where are they?
- We're celebrating, Shane.</i>

103
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:43,104
Don't need to do this now.

104
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:46,340
Whoa, wait a second.
This is why we're here, right?

105
00:08:47,476 --> 00:08:49,043
<i>This was your move...</i>

106
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,012
Supposed to find
all the answers.

107
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,880
Instead we...

108
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:55,249
We found him.

109
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,119
Found one man. Why?

110
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:01,422
Well, when things got bad,

111
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,958
a lot of people just left.

112
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:07,428
Went off to be
with their families.

113
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,731
And when things got worse,

114
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,500
when the military cordon
got overrun,

115
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,268
the rest bolted.

116
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,771
Every last one?

117
00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:20,942
No, many couldn't face
walking out the door.

118
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:26,147
They... opted out.

119
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:29,217
<i>There was a rash
of suicides.</i>

120
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,455
That was a bad time.

121
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,957
You didn't leave.

122
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,825
Why?

123
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,827
I just kept working.

124
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:43,231
Hoping to do some good.

125
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:50,171
Dude, you are such
a buzzkill, man.

126
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:55,643
Most of the facility
is powered down

127
00:09:55,677 --> 00:09:58,212
including housing, so you'll
have to make do here.

128
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,281
The couches are comfortable,

129
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:02,650
but there are cots
in storage if you like.

130
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:06,954
There's a rec room down the
hall that you kids might enjoy.

131
00:10:06,989 --> 00:10:09,957
Just don't plug in
the video games, okay?

132
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:12,827
Or anything that draws power.
The same applies...

133
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:14,862
If you shower,
go easy on the hot water.

134
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:19,367
Hot water?

135
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,136
That's what the man said.

136
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,089
Ah!

137
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,528
Hey.

138
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:35,276
<i>Andrea?</i>

139
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,516
That's it.

140
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:45,019
That's it.
Get it out.

141
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:48,623
There you go.

142
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,793
Oh... God.

143
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,802
Oh.

144
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,840
Everything's gone.

145
00:12:05,874 --> 00:12:08,142
It's always better going
down than coming up, huh?

146
00:12:08,176 --> 00:12:10,378
I don't mean the wine, Dale.

147
00:12:10,412 --> 00:12:14,682
You know, it's over.
There's nothing left.

148
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,351
Don't you see that?

149
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:20,187
Oh, I...
I see a...

150
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:23,190
a chance to make a new start.

151
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,694
Oh my God, Dale.

152
00:12:26,728 --> 00:12:30,231
Dale, didn't you see
the look on Jenner's face?

153
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,467
Hear what I'm saying.

154
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,270
There's nothing left.

155
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,146
How's the blood?

156
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,348
No surprises.

157
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:57,258
I came to thank you.

158
00:12:59,661 --> 00:13:01,529
You did.

159
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,100
You all...
you all right?

160
00:13:06,134 --> 00:13:08,736
You don't know what it's like.

161
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,807
You don't know what
it's like out there.

162
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:15,710
<i>You may think you do,
but you don't.</i>

163
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,348
We'd have died out there.

164
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,885
<i>It was only
a matter of time.</i>

165
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,854
<i>There's too many
of those things.</i>

166
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,993
My... my boy...

167
00:13:34,062 --> 00:13:37,331
My... my wife,
I never...

168
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,136
I never told 'em
what I really thought.

169
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,376
I never even hinted, just...

170
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,749
just kept it in.

171
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:59,387
Kept it in and kept us
moving, you know.

172
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,722
<i>Just kept it in.
Kept us...</i>

173
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,358
It'll all be okay.

174
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:09,930
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

175
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,845
<i>- Any good books?
- Uh-huh.</i>

176
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,815
<i>Enough
to keep us busy for years.</i>

177
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,850
All right.
Come on, kids, it's bedtime.

178
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:33,654
Baby, go say your prayers.
I'm gonna browse a bit.

179
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:35,656
Come on.

180
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,559
This is the first night we might
actually get some real sleep.

181
00:14:38,593 --> 00:14:40,694
- <i>Hmm.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?</i>

182
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,420
Jesus, you scared me.

183
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,756
I'm gonna tell you a few things

184
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,691
and you're gonna listen to me.

185
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,259
Now is not the time.

186
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,762
Come on.
When is it ever the time?

187
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:20,935
How can you treat me like this?

188
00:15:20,969 --> 00:15:22,770
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Huh-uh.

189
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,839
Because you told me
my husband was dead.

190
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,041
<i>I didn't lie to you, all right?
I didn't.</i>

191
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:29,410
Do you know
what it was like there?

192
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:33,714
Stop.
Things were falling apart.

193
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,950
They were slaughtering
people in the hallways.

194
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,853
<i>It was a massacre.
There were walkers everywhere.</i>

195
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:40,754
- So you left him?
- Everybody else ran.

196
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:43,290
There were no doctors there.
It was just me.

197
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:46,694
He was hooked up to machines
and I did not know what to do.

198
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,330
I even took my ear
and I put it on his chest

199
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,732
and I listened for a heartbeat
and I did not hear one.

200
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,267
<i>And I-I-I-I...
I don't know why.</i>

201
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:55,169
Maybe it was gunfire.
I don't know what it was,

202
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:57,371
but there was no way he
could've survived that. No way.

203
00:15:57,405 --> 00:16:00,741
- He did. - Yeah, but then I had
y'all to think about, didn't I?

204
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,877
- I had you and Carl, and I needed
to think about... - Okay. No no.

205
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,411
I had to get you guys
safe to Atlanta.

206
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,946
That's what I had to do.
Just stop.

207
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:07,548
If you thought for one second

208
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:10,084
that he was still alive,
would you have come?

209
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:12,052
So I saved your life...

210
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,588
you and your little boy's.
That's what I did.

211
00:16:14,623 --> 00:16:16,257
Right?

212
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:18,826
Okay.

213
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,129
And if I could've traded
places with him, I would have.

214
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,666
I would trade places
with him right now because...

215
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,169
- No no no. No.
- No no no, you...

216
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,470
- I love you. Shh shh.
- No. No, you're drunk.

217
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,205
- I love you.
- No, you're drunk.

218
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,374
And I know there were some things
that say that you love me too.

219
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,743
Because there's no way that you could've
been with me the way that you were.

220
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,878
- Shane. Shane. Shane!
- Just... Okay, stop.

221
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,915
- Listen. You love me. - Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me.

222
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:42,917
- I love you. There's nobody here.
- Please! No!

223
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,286
Stop, Lori.
It's all right. Just...

224
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:57,224
We don't
have to be afraid anymore.

225
00:18:00,028 --> 00:18:02,463
We're safe here.

226
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:04,164
All right?

227
00:18:16,848 --> 00:18:19,884
Hello.

228
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,919
- Morning.
- Are you hungover?

229
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:26,991
<i>- Mom said you'd be.
- Mom is right.</i>

230
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,693
Mom has that annoying habit.

231
00:18:29,728 --> 00:18:34,298
<i>Eggs. Powdered, but...
but I do 'em good.</i>

232
00:18:34,332 --> 00:18:36,800
I bet you can't tell.

233
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:40,971
Protein helps the hangover.

234
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:42,673
Where'd all this come from?

235
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,508
- Jenner.
- Could you help me, please?

236
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:46,343
He thought we could use it.

237
00:18:46,378 --> 00:18:48,178
- Thank you.
- Some of us, at least.

238
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:51,081
Don't ever ever ever
let me drink again.

239
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,217
- <i>Hey.
- Hey.</i>

240
00:18:54,986 --> 00:18:57,254
Feel as bad as I do?

241
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,056
Worse.

242
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,694
The hell happened to you?

243
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,629
<i>Your neck?</i>

244
00:19:05,664 --> 00:19:07,398
I must have done it
in my sleep.

245
00:19:07,432 --> 00:19:09,066
Never seen you do that before.

246
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,035
Me neither.

247
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,404
Not like me at all.

248
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,878
- Morning.
- Hey, doc.

249
00:19:20,912 --> 00:19:24,715
Doctor, I don't mean to slam you
with questions first thing...

250
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:26,617
But you will anyway.

251
00:19:26,651 --> 00:19:28,752
We didn't come here
for the eggs.

252
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,764
<i>Give me playback of TS-19.</i>

253
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,866
Playback of TS-19.

254
00:19:45,203 --> 00:19:48,072
Few people ever
got a chance to see this.

255
00:19:48,106 --> 00:19:50,040
Very few.

256
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:59,583
- Is that a brain?
- An extraordinary one.

257
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:03,721
Not that it matters in the end.

258
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,189
Take us in for E.I.V..

259
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:07,725
Enhanced internal view.

260
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:25,776
What are those lights?

261
00:20:27,512 --> 00:20:29,680
It's a person's life...

262
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:31,448
experiences, memories.

263
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:33,584
It's everything.

264
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:36,220
<i>Somewhere in
all that organic wiring,</i>

265
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:38,689
<i>all those ripples of light,</i>

266
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:40,758
is you...

267
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,360
<i>the thing
that makes you unique.</i>

268
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:45,929
<i>And human.</i>

269
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:48,298
You don't make sense ever?

270
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,833
Those are synapses,

271
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:51,635
<i>electric impulses
in the brain</i>

272
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,637
<i>that carry
all the messages.</i>

273
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:56,440
<i>They determine
everything a person says</i>

274
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:59,476
<i>does or thinks
from the moment of birth</i>

275
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,445
to the moment of death.

276
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,715
Death? That's what
this is, a vigil?

277
00:21:04,749 --> 00:21:06,417
Yes.

278
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:11,522
Or rather the playback
of the vigil.

279
00:21:12,657 --> 00:21:14,591
This person died?

280
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:17,461
Who?

281
00:21:17,495 --> 00:21:20,030
Test subject 19.

282
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,701
Someone who was bitten

283
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:25,869
and infected...

284
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:29,306
And volunteered to have us

285
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,408
record the process.

286
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:36,714
Vi, scan forward
to the first event.

287
00:21:36,748 --> 00:21:40,084
<i>Scanning to first event.</i>

288
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,958
What is that?

289
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:52,329
It invades the brain
like meningitis.

290
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:56,300
<i>The adrenal glands
hemorrhage,</i>

291
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,202
<i>the brain goes
into shutdown,</i>

292
00:21:58,236 --> 00:22:00,204
<i>then the major organs.</i>

293
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,876
Then death.

294
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,947
<i>Everything you ever were
or ever will be...</i>

295
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,551
<i>Gone.</i>

296
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:16,854
Is that what happened to Jim?

297
00:22:16,888 --> 00:22:18,756
Yes.

298
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:29,733
<i>She lost somebody
two days ago.</i>

299
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,335
Her sister.

300
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,304
I lost somebody too.

301
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:36,874
I know how devastating it is.

302
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:44,047
Scan to the second event.

303
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:46,183
Scanning to second event.

304
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,254
The resurrection
times vary wildly.

305
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:54,291
We had reports of it happening
in as little as three minutes.

306
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:56,593
<i>The longest we heard of
was eight hours.</i>

307
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,229
<i>In the case
of this patient,</i>

308
00:22:59,264 --> 00:23:01,932
it was two hours, one minute...

309
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,335
Seven seconds.

310
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:19,216
- It restarts the brain?
- No, just the brain stem.

311
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,452
Basically,
it gets them up and moving.

312
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:24,354
But they're not alive?

313
00:23:26,024 --> 00:23:27,825
You tell me.

314
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,195
It's nothing like before.

315
00:23:31,229 --> 00:23:33,530
<i>Most of that brain
is dark.</i>

316
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:36,366
Dark, lifeless, dead.

317
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:38,001
The frontal lobe,
the neocortex,

318
00:23:38,036 --> 00:23:39,369
the human part...
That doesn't come back.

319
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:41,238
<i>The you part.</i>

320
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,274
<i>Just a shell</i>

321
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:46,710
<i>driven by
mindless instinct.</i>

322
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:51,882
God.
What was that?

323
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:55,319
He shot his patient
in the head.

324
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,556
Didn't you?

325
00:23:59,591 --> 00:24:01,592
Vi, power down the main screen

326
00:24:01,626 --> 00:24:03,126
and the workstations.

327
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:06,330
<i>Powering down main
screen and workstations.</i>

328
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,168
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

329
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,572
It could be microbial,

330
00:24:15,607 --> 00:24:17,574
<i>viral, parasitic,</i>

331
00:24:17,609 --> 00:24:20,711
<i>- fungal.
- Or the wrath of God?</i>

332
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:24,181
There is that.

333
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:26,183
Somebody must know something.

334
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:27,918
Somebody somewhere.

335
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:31,188
There are others, right?
Other facilities?

336
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,591
There may be some.

337
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:37,027
People like me.

338
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,062
But you don't know?
How can you not know?

339
00:24:39,097 --> 00:24:40,597
Everything went down.

340
00:24:40,632 --> 00:24:42,666
<i>Communications,
directives... all of it.</i>

341
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,702
I've been in the dark
for almost a month.

342
00:24:45,737 --> 00:24:47,804
So it's not just here.

343
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,608
There's nothing left
anywhere? Nothing?

344
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:54,177
That's what you're
really saying, right?

345
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:05,989
Jesus.

346
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:08,191
Man, I'm gonna get
shit-faced drunk again.

347
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:11,028
Dr. Jenner, I know this
has been taxing for you

348
00:25:11,062 --> 00:25:14,231
and I hate to ask
one more question, but...

349
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,200
That clock...

350
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,236
<i>It's counting down.</i>

351
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:23,273
What happens at zero?

352
00:25:25,777 --> 00:25:30,213
The basement generators...
they run out of fuel.

353
00:25:32,216 --> 00:25:34,051
And then?

354
00:25:37,055 --> 00:25:39,623
Vi, what happens
when the power runs out?

355
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,892
When the power runs out,

356
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:45,729
<i>facility-wide
decontamination will occur.</i>

357
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:52,844
<i>Decontamination...
What does that mean?</i>

358
00:25:52,878 --> 00:25:54,979
I don't like the
way Jenner clammed up.

359
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,282
The way he just
wandered off like that.

360
00:25:57,316 --> 00:26:00,018
What's wrong with him?
Seriously, man,

361
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:01,653
is he nuts, medicated, what?

362
00:26:03,022 --> 00:26:05,156
In there.

363
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,134
Check that way.

364
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:17,702
Shane.

365
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:44,829
It's empty.

366
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:50,535
- <i>Emergency lighting on.
- What the hell is this?</i>

367
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,907
Hey, you guys kill the lights?

368
00:26:55,941 --> 00:26:58,076
<i>- Nah, it just went out.
- Anything?</i>

369
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,713
Yeah, a lot of dead generators

370
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,182
and more empty fuel drums
than I can count.

371
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:08,520
It can't be down
to just that one.

372
00:27:16,662 --> 00:27:20,331
Mom?
Something wrong?

373
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:23,668
Nothing.
It's just...

374
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:26,838
The air conditioning stopped.

375
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:47,258
I did the best I could
in the time that I had.

376
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:51,863
I hope you'd be proud of that.

377
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:14,953
We always think there's
gonna be more time...

378
00:28:20,793 --> 00:28:22,594
...Then it runs out.

379
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:25,930
Why is the air off?

380
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,466
- And the lights in our room?
- What's going on?

381
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,068
Why is everything turned off?

382
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:31,870
Energy use is
being prioritized.

383
00:28:31,904 --> 00:28:34,305
Air isn't a priority?
And lights?

384
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,542
It's not up to me.
Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

385
00:28:37,576 --> 00:28:39,744
Hey! Hey, what the hell
does that mean?

386
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:42,247
<i>Hey man, I'm talking to you.</i>

387
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:44,883
What do you mean
it's shutting itself down?

388
00:28:44,917 --> 00:28:46,651
<i>How can
a building do anything?</i>

389
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:48,186
- <i>You'd be surprised.
- Rick?</i>

390
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,993
Jenner, what's happening?

391
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:58,329
The system is dropping all
the nonessential uses of power.

392
00:28:58,364 --> 00:29:01,833
It's designed to keep the computers
running to the last possible second.

393
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,135
That started as we approached
the half-hour mark.

394
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:06,004
Right on schedule.

395
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:20,184
- It was the French.
- What?

396
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,153
They were the last ones
to hold out as far as I know.

397
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:24,222
<i>While our people were
bolting out the doors</i>

398
00:29:24,256 --> 00:29:25,857
and committing suicide
in the hallways,

399
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:27,425
they stayed in the labs
till the end.

400
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:30,828
They thought they were
close to a solution.

401
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:32,730
What happened?

402
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,866
The same thing
that's happening here.

403
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:37,368
No power grid.

404
00:29:37,403 --> 00:29:39,704
Ran out of juice.

405
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,075
The world runs of fossil fuel.

406
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:46,110
I mean, how stupid is that?

407
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:49,047
- Let me tell you...
- To hell with it, Shane. I don't even care.

408
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,582
Lori, grab our things.
Everybody, get your stuff.

409
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:53,685
<i>We're getting out
of here now!</i>

410
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:55,453
Oh, okay.

411
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:57,255
<i>What's that?</i>

412
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:01,392
What's that?

413
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,362
<i>30 minutes to
decontamination.</i>

414
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,834
Doc, what's going on here?

415
00:30:09,868 --> 00:30:11,569
Everybody, y'all heard Rick.

416
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:13,304
Get your stuff and let's go!
Go now! Go!

417
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:14,739
- Let's go.
- Come on!

418
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:18,843
No.

419
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:22,246
Did you just lock us in?

420
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:24,315
<i>He just locked us in!</i>

421
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,018
We've hit the 30-minute window.
I am recording.

422
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,722
<i>- Carl.
- Mom!</i>

423
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:32,490
- You son of a bitch.
- Shane!

424
00:30:32,524 --> 00:30:34,492
- You let us out of here!
- No, stop. Don't!

425
00:30:34,526 --> 00:30:37,328
- You lying...
- No no no no!

426
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,163
Wait, no!
No, don't do it.

427
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:44,235
Hey, Jenner,
open that door now.

428
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,671
There's no point.
Everything topside is locked down.

429
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:48,172
The emergency exits are sealed.

430
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,674
<i>Well, open the damn things.</i>

431
00:30:49,708 --> 00:30:51,909
That's not something I control.
The computers do.

432
00:30:51,944 --> 00:30:54,946
I told you once
that front door closed,

433
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,115
it wouldn't open again.
You heard me say that.

434
00:30:59,885 --> 00:31:02,053
- It's better this way.
- What is?

435
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,455
What happens in 28 minutes?

436
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,594
<i>- What happens in 28 minutes?!
- Come on!</i>

437
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:12,130
You know what this place is?!

438
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,632
We protected the public

439
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,435
from very nasty stuff!

440
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,639
Weaponized smallpox!

441
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,876
Ebola strains that could
wipe out half the country!

442
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,079
Stuff you don't want
getting out! Ever!

443
00:31:40,926 --> 00:31:43,661
In the event of a
catastrophic power failure...

444
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,297
in a terrorist attack,
for example...

445
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:49,734
H.I.T.S are deployed to prevent
any organisms from getting out.

446
00:31:49,768 --> 00:31:51,903
H.I.T.S?

447
00:31:53,572 --> 00:31:56,007
<i>- Vi, define.
- Hits...</i>

448
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,177
<i>high-impulse thermobaric
fuel-air explosives</i>

449
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,412
<i>coexists of a two-stage
aerosol ignition</i>

450
00:32:01,447 --> 00:32:04,715
<i>that produces a blast wave
of significantly greater power</i>

451
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,717
<i>and duration than
any other known explosive</i>

452
00:32:06,752 --> 00:32:08,352
<i>except nuclear.</i>

453
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:11,322
<i>The vacuum-pressure effect
ignites the oxygen</i>

454
00:32:11,356 --> 00:32:14,058
<i>between 5,000°
and 6,000°</i>

455
00:32:14,093 --> 00:32:16,527
<i>and is used when the
greatest loss of life</i>

456
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,830
<i>and damage
to structures is desired.</i>

457
00:32:18,864 --> 00:32:20,998
It sets the air on fire.

458
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:26,537
No pain.

459
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,675
An end to sorrow, grief...

460
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:34,245
Regret.

461
00:32:42,554 --> 00:32:44,455
Everything.

462
00:32:50,611 --> 00:32:53,213
Open the damn door!

463
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:56,750
Out of my way!

464
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,251
Daryl!

465
00:33:06,727 --> 00:33:08,528
You should've
left well enough alone.

466
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:11,531
- It would've been so much easier.
- Easier for who?

467
00:33:11,565 --> 00:33:13,533
All of you.
You know what's out there...

468
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:17,537
<i>A short, brutal life
and an agonizing death.</i>

469
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:21,841
Your... your sister...
what was her name?

470
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,543
<i>- Amy.
- Amy.</i>

471
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:25,745
You know what this does.

472
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,047
You've seen it.

473
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:29,449
Is that really what you want
for your wife and son?

474
00:33:29,483 --> 00:33:31,684
<i>I don't want this.</i>

475
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,020
<i>Can't make a dent.</i>

476
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,656
Those doors are designed to
withstand a rocket launcher.

477
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,725
- Well, your head ain't!
- Whoa! Whoa!

478
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,660
Daryl!
Daryl!

479
00:33:40,694 --> 00:33:44,464
Just back up!
Back up!

480
00:33:44,498 --> 00:33:46,933
You do want this.

481
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,334
Last night you said

482
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,003
you knew it was just
a matter of time

483
00:33:50,037 --> 00:33:51,871
before everybody
you loved was dead.

484
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:54,040
What?

485
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,044
What?
You really said that?

486
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,679
<i>After all your big talk?</i>

487
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:01,414
I had to keep
hope alive, didn't I?

488
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:03,183
There is no hope.

489
00:34:03,217 --> 00:34:05,351
- There never was.
- There's always hope.

490
00:34:05,386 --> 00:34:07,253
Maybe it won't be you,
maybe not here,

491
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,855
but somebody somewhere...

492
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,624
What part of "everything is
gone" do you not understand?

493
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:14,027
<i>Listen to your friend.
She gets it.</i>

494
00:34:14,061 --> 00:34:16,696
This is what takes us down.

495
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:21,000
This is our extinction event.

496
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:27,173
This isn't right.

497
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,676
You can't just keep us here.

498
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,479
One tiny moment...

499
00:34:32,513 --> 00:34:34,481
a millisecond.
No pain.

500
00:34:34,515 --> 00:34:38,051
<i>My daughter doesn't deserve
to die like this.</i>

501
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:43,656
Wouldn't it be kinder,

502
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:47,160
more compassionate
to just hold your loved ones

503
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:50,497
and wait for the clock to run down?

504
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:52,165
- Shane, no!
- Out of the way, Rick!

505
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,667
Stay out of my way!
Open that door

506
00:34:54,702 --> 00:34:56,469
or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Do you hear me?!

507
00:34:56,504 --> 00:34:59,572
Brother, brother, this is
not the way you do this.

508
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:02,075
- We will never get out of here.
- Shane, you listen to him.

509
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:05,411
- It's too late.
- He dies, we all...

510
00:35:05,446 --> 00:35:07,547
...We all die! Shane!

511
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:15,021
Shane!

512
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,900
Are you done now?
Are you done?

513
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:28,935
Yeah, I guess we all are.

514
00:35:51,058 --> 00:35:53,092
I think you're lying.

515
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:57,764
<i>- What?
- You're lying</i>

516
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:00,466
about no hope.

517
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,002
If that were true, you'd
have bolted with the rest

518
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,905
or taken the easy way out.
You didn't.

519
00:36:07,841 --> 00:36:09,676
<i>You chose
the hard path.</i>

520
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,578
<i>- Why?
- It doesn't matter.</i>

521
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:14,314
It does matter.
It always matters.

522
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:17,317
You stayed when others ran.

523
00:36:17,351 --> 00:36:20,587
- Why?
- Not because I wanted to.

524
00:36:20,621 --> 00:36:22,755
I made a promise...

525
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,125
To her.

526
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,361
My wife.

527
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:34,133
Test subject 19 was your wife?

528
00:36:34,168 --> 00:36:37,370
She begged me to keep going
as long as I could.

529
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,807
How could I say no?

530
00:36:40,841 --> 00:36:43,509
She was dying.

531
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,912
It should've been me
on that table.

532
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:47,380
I wouldn't have
mattered to anybody.

533
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,717
<i>She was a loss
to the world.</i>

534
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,586
Hell, she ran this place.
I just worked here.

535
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:56,055
<i>In our field,
she was an Einstein.</i>

536
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,727
Me? I'm just...
Edwin Jenner.

537
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:03,796
She could've done
something about this.

538
00:37:03,831 --> 00:37:06,065
Not me.

539
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,835
Your wife didn't have a choice.

540
00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:13,106
You do. That's...
that's all we want...

541
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:17,076
a choice, a chance.

542
00:37:18,746 --> 00:37:21,614
Let us keep trying
as long as we can.

543
00:37:28,055 --> 00:37:31,958
I told you topside's locked down.
I can't open those.

544
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:45,805
Come on!

545
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,776
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

546
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,912
- Come on!
- Move it! Move it!

547
00:37:52,946 --> 00:37:55,548
- <i>Come on, let's go!
- We're gonna get out of here, Sophia.</i>

548
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:57,283
There's your chance.
Take it.

549
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,686
I'm grateful.

550
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,988
- The day will come when you won't be.
- Let's go!

551
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:19,038
Hey, we've got four minutes left!
Come on!

552
00:38:19,073 --> 00:38:21,774
- Let's go. Let's go.
- No no, I'm staying.

553
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:23,743
I'm staying, sweetie.

554
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:26,312
- But that's insane!
- No, it's completely sane.

555
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:27,947
For the first time
in a long time.

556
00:38:27,981 --> 00:38:31,117
I'm not ending up
like Jim and Amy.

557
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,588
There's no time to argue

558
00:38:35,622 --> 00:38:38,424
and no point,
not if you want to get out.

559
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:40,493
Just get out.
Get out.

560
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:43,996
Dog.
Come on, man.

561
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:45,698
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

562
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:55,341
I'm staying too.

563
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,244
<i>Andrea, no.</i>

564
00:39:00,948 --> 00:39:03,282
- Just go! Go!
- Come on.

565
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,026
Andrea,

566
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:17,130
this isn't what
Amy would want for you.

567
00:39:17,164 --> 00:39:20,299
She's dead,
and you need to leave.

568
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:29,409
- Get them doors open!
- Come on!

569
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:32,745
- It doesn't work!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

570
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,515
Try it! Try it!
Try it now!

571
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:40,753
- Come on! Come on!
- Stay close, sweetheart.

572
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,559
Time's almost up.

573
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,897
Daryl, look out!

574
00:39:58,138 --> 00:40:00,540
Dog, get down!
Get down!

575
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,611
<i>- Jesus.
- The glass won't break?</i>

576
00:40:06,647 --> 00:40:09,081
Rick, I have something
that might help.

577
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,251
Carol, I don't think
a nail file's gonna do it.

578
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,253
Your first morning at camp,

579
00:40:14,288 --> 00:40:17,723
when I washed your uniform
I found this in your pocket.

580
00:40:20,494 --> 00:40:22,161
Come on.

581
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,730
Look out!

582
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:33,973
Oh...

583
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:35,608
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit!

584
00:40:44,251 --> 00:40:45,952
Okay.

585
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,821
You win.

586
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:59,966
- What are you doing?
- I said okay.

587
00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:05,371
- Don't pull this, Dale.
- I'm not pulling anything.

588
00:41:05,405 --> 00:41:07,974
If you're staying, I stay too.

589
00:41:08,008 --> 00:41:11,143
<i>He's right. We know what's
waiting for us out there.</i>

590
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:13,246
I don't want to face it alone.

591
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,215
Dale, get the hell out.

592
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,618
I don't want you here.

593
00:41:18,652 --> 00:41:21,621
Too bad.
See, you don't get to do that,

594
00:41:21,655 --> 00:41:23,789
to... to come into
somebody's life,

595
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,459
make them care
and then just check out.

596
00:41:32,232 --> 00:41:34,033
I'm staying.

597
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:37,970
The matter is settled.

598
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,403
Wait wait wait.
Wait wait.

599
00:42:10,437 --> 00:42:11,938
<i>They're coming.</i>

600
00:42:23,717 --> 00:42:25,518
They got out.

601
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:45,338
Come on.

602
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:48,307
Dale, get down! Down!

603
00:42:48,342 --> 00:42:52,044
Get back!
Everybody down! Down!

604
00:42:54,548 --> 00:42:55,848
Get down!

605
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,939
Come on.
Come on.

606
00:43:56,943 --> 00:43:58,744
Come on. Come on.
Get in, get in, get in.

607
00:43:58,779 --> 00:44:00,513
<i>Get in!</i>

608

<i>* yes and only if my own
true love was waiting *</i>

613

<i>* yes and only

615
00:44:42,789 --> 00:44:45,057
