2
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:29,651
Little girl?

3
00:03:30,691 --> 00:03:32,401
I'm a policeman.

4
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,681
Little girl.

5
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,461
Don't be afraid, OK?

6
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,981
Little girl.

7
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,091
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:04,421
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

9
00:05:04,951 --> 00:05:07,861
I never met a woman who knew
how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,999
They're born thinking the
switch only goes one way... On.

11
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,247
They're struck blind the
second they leave a room.

12
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,902
I mean every woman, I ever let
have a key... I swear to God.

13
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:22,087
It's like I... come home,
house is all lit up,

14
00:05:23,082 --> 00:05:25,004
and my job, you see,
apparently... because...

15
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,930
because my chromosomes
happen to be different

16
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:29,901
cause I then gotta walk
through that house,

17
00:05:29,991 --> 00:05:32,641
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

18
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,491
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

19
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,361
Alright, Reverend Shane's
preaching to you now, boy.

20
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,281
The same chick, mind ya.

21
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,971
She'll bitch about global warming.

22
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:48,345
That's when Reverend
Shane wants to

23
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:51,631
quote from the Guy Gospel
and say "Um, darling?"

24
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:55,401
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

25
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:58,698
just figured out that the light
switch see, goes both ways,"

26
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:01,281
maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

27
00:06:01,331 --> 00:06:03,551
- You say that?
- Yeah.

28
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,771
Anyway, uh... Polite version...

29
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,021
Still man, that...
that earns me this.

30
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,681
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

31
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,881
And that's when the
exorcist voice pops out.

32
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,711
"You sound just
like my damn father.

33
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:20,115
"Always, always yelling
about the power bill,"

34
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:22,261
"telling me to turn
off the damn lights."

35
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:23,581
What do you say to that?

36
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,201
You know what I wanna say.

37
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,881
I wanna say,"Bitch,
you mean to tell me

38
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,481
you've been hearing
this your entire life

39
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:31,721
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

40
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:36,811
You know... I don't
actually say that, tho.

41
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:40,201
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

42
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:41,331
the polite version there...

43
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,321
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:50,761
So how's it with Lori, man?

45
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:54,341
She's good. She's good
at turning off lights.

46
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,631
Really good.

47
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,071
And I'm the one who sometimes forget.

48
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,111
Not what I meant.

49
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,841
We didn't have a great night.

50
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:10,191
Look, man, I may have a... fail to
amuse with my sermon, but I did try.

51
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:13,141
The least you could do is speak.

52
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:17,941
That's what she always says:
"Speak".

53
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,591
"Speak".

54
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:23,145
You think I was the
most closed mouth

55
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:25,231
son of a bitch you'd ever
hear to hear her tell it.

56
00:07:27,611 --> 00:07:30,471
Do you express your thoughts?

57
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,701
You share your feelings
and that kind of stuff?

58
00:07:35,081 --> 00:07:36,551
The thing is...

59
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,391
lately whenever I try...

60
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:46,191
everything I say makes her impatient,
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

61
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,141
It's like she's...

62
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:52,701
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

63
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,451
Look, man, that's just
shit couples go through.

64
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:59,011
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

65
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:05,351
Last thing she said this morning?

66
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:09,401
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

67
00:08:11,111 --> 00:08:14,311
She said that in front of our kid.

68
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,851
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

69
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:24,471
Difference between men and women?

70
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,731
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

71
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:32,241
Certainly not in front of Carl.

72
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,965
All available units,
high speed pursuit

73
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,171
in progress Lincoln county
units request local assistance.

74
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:46,601
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

75
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,951
Proceed with extreme caution.

76
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,011
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

77
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,901
Be advised, they have
fired on police officers.

78
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:07,791
One Lincoln county
officer is wounded.

79
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,621
Unit 1, Unit 3.

80
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:21,795
18, 2 miles west of Interstate 85

81
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,811
and we'll patch in Lincoln
County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,291
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:32,841
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3,
we are 10-97 in code 100.

84
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:35,811
Highway 18, 85 Interstate,
please advise.

85
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:55,911
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

86
00:09:56,081 --> 00:09:57,921
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

87
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,801
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

88
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:02,111
What I think, Leon,
is that you need to stay focused.

89
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:04,831
Make sure you got a round in the
chamber and your safety off.

90
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:14,761
Would be kind of cool to
get on one of them shows.

91
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:03,641
Holy shit.

92
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,971
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

93
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,301
Put the gun down!

94
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:05,491
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

95
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:13,331
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

96
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:15,931
Me too.

97
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,521
Son of a bitch shot me.

98
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,041
You believe that?

99
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,371
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:21,451 --> 00:12:22,671
Yeah.

101
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:26,471
Shane, you do not tell
Lori that happened.

102
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,151
Ever.

103
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,001
You understand...

104
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:33,971
Rick! Rick! No, no, no!

105
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:39,681
No, no, no, no... He's hurt!

106
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:41,621
Leon!

107
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,465
You get that ambulance down here,

108
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:45,231
you tell them there's an
officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:49,201
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me?

110
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:53,021
Okay. Shh, shh,
stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:56,921
Shh, shh, ok?
You stay with me, ok?

112
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:18,121
Hey, bud... We're still here.

113
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,751
We're still hanging in.

114
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:26,971
Look, I'm sorry, man.

115
00:13:27,111 --> 00:13:30,171
I know I say the same
crap every time I come in here.

116
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:36,571
Everybody pitched in on these.
They uh...

117
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:39,711
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

118
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,471
They hope you come back real soon.

119
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:49,121
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

120
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,101
You probably could tell, hmm?

121
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,131
I'll just set this on
your side table, ok?

122
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,121
That vase has something special.

123
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,251
Fess up.

124
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:13,051
Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

125
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,671
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

126
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:26,181
Shane?

127
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:32,201
Shane, you in the john?

128
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:52,081
Nurse, help.

129
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:56,631
Nurse. Help!

130
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,293
Lori!

131
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,853
Lori!

132
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:59,943
Carl! Carl!

133
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,463
Lori! Carl!

134
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:24,563
Lori! Carl!

135
00:24:41,803 --> 00:24:43,783
Is this real?

136
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,573
Am I here?

137
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:54,473
Wake, wake up!

138
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:09,723
Daddy, daddy!

139
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,283
Carl... Carl?

140
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:14,573
- I found you...
- Daddy, I got this sumbitch.

141
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,553
I'm gonna smack him dead.

142
00:26:23,763 --> 00:26:24,793
He say something?

143
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:26,023
I thought I heard
him say something.

144
00:26:26,093 --> 00:26:28,583
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

145
00:26:28,803 --> 00:26:32,763
Hey, mister!
What's that bandage for?

146
00:26:33,213 --> 00:26:36,253
- What?
- What kind of wound?

147
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:39,723
You answer me, damn you!

148
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:41,713
What's your wound?

149
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:44,763
You tell me!

150
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,793
Or I will kill you.

151
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:13,023
Got that bandage changed out.

152
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,273
It was pretty rank.

153
00:27:15,523 --> 00:27:16,923
What was?

154
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,103
The wound?

155
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:21,193
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:25,123
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:27,723
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:33,543
Look, I ask and you answer,
It's common courtesy, right?

159
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:40,103
Did you get bit?

160
00:27:41,983 --> 00:27:43,213
- Bit?
- Bit.

161
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:44,863
Chewed. Maybe scratch?

162
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:46,953
Anything like that.

163
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,873
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:49,963 --> 00:27:52,463
Just shot, as far as I know.

165
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,885
Hey... Just let me...

166
00:28:01,563 --> 00:28:03,143
Feels cooler now.

167
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:06,173
Fever would have
killed you by now.

168
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,003
I don't think I have one.

169
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:10,993
Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:19,183
Take a moment,
eh? Look how sharp it is.

171
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:24,723
You try anything... I will kill you
with it, and don't you think I won't.

172
00:28:36,243 --> 00:28:37,903
Come on up when you're able.

173
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,173
Come on.

174
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:19,070
This place... It's
Fred and Cindy Drake's.

175
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,300
Never met them.

176
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,190
I've been here. This is their place

177
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,940
It was empty when we got here.

178
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't do that.

179
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,310
They'll see the light.

180
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,890
There's more of them
out there than usual.

181
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,910
I never should have
fired that gun today.

182
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,490
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

183
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,520
Stupid... using a gun...

184
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,210
It all happened so fast...

185
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,030
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

186
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,570
Man?

187
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,440
No man...

188
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,190
What the hell was that out
of your mouth just now?

189
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,260
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

190
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,130
In this street, out front, a man.

191
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,460
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

192
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,310
Come on.

193
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,070
Sit down, before you fall down.

194
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,840
Here. Eat.

195
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:19,650
Daddy... Blessing...

196
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,550
Yeah.

197
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,260
Father, we thank thee for this food...
Thy blessings...

198
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,680
We ask you to watch over
us in these crazy days.

199
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,210
- Amen.
- Amen.

200
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,500
Hey, mister, do you even
know what is going on?

201
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,970
I woke up today.

202
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,450
In a hospital.

203
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,640
Came home, that's all I know.

204
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,430
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

205
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,730
Out on the loading dock,
hauling trucks.

206
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,710
No... Not the one's they put down...
The one's they didn't.

207
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,980
The walkers.

208
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,190
Like the one I shot today.

209
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,040
Cause he would have
ripped into you.

210
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,700
Try to eat you,
take him some flesh at least.

211
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,770
But I guess if this is the first you're
hearing, I know how it must sound...

212
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,880
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

213
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,500
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

214
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,850
Maybe it's the cool air or... Hell, maybe
it's just me firing up that gun today.

215
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:47,770
But we'll be fine
long as we stay quiet.

216
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,960
Probably wander off by morning.

217
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,730
Well, listen...

218
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,650
One thing I do know...
Don't you get bit!

219
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,420
We saw your bandage and
that's why we were afraid of.

220
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,100
Bites kill you.

221
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,020
The fever... burns you out.

222
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:10,020
But then after a while...

223
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,730
You come back.

224
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,850
Seen it happen...

225
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,070
Come on...

226
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,790
Carl... He your son?

227
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,080
William. He said his name today...

228
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,000
He's a little younger...
than your boy.

229
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,740
And he's with his mother?

230
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,010
I hope so.

231
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,080
- Dad?
- Yeah?

232
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,650
Did you ask him?

233
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,170
Your gun shot...
We got a little bet going.

234
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,240
My boy say you're a...
bank robber...

235
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,390
Yeah...That's me.

236
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,720
Deadly as Dillinger Kapow.

237
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,500
Sheriff's deputy

238
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,380
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

239
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,400
It's nothing.

240
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,290
One of them must've
bumped a car...

241
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,070
You sure?

242
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,380
Happened once before.

243
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,370
Went off a few minutes.

244
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,250
Get the light, Dwayne.

245
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,840
It's the blue one,
down the street.

246
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,100
Same one as last time.

247
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,380
I think we're ok.

248
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,900
That noise... Will it
bring more of them?

249
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,510
Nothing to do about it now.

250
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,720
Just have to wait 'em
out till morning.

251
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,720
She's here.

252
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,010
Don't look.

253
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,440
Get away from the windows.

254
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,930
I said go! Come on!

255
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,650
Come on, quiet.

256
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,560
It's ok, here.

257
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,480
Cry into the pillow.

258
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,930
Can you remember?

259
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,100
She, uh...

260
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,430
She died in the other room,
on that bed...

261
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,680
Nothin' I can do about it here...
That fever, man...

262
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,980
Her skin gave off
heat like a furnace...

263
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:11,950
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

264
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,030
You know what... I just
didn't have it in me...

265
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:24,000
She's the mother of my child.

266
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,380
You sure? They're dead.

267
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,330
They have to ask,
at least one more time.

268
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,260
They're dead.

269
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,570
Except for something in the brain.

270
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,060
That's why it's gotta be the head.

271
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
You alright?

272
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,850
Need a moment

273
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,820
They're alive.

274
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,510
My wife and son.

275
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,540
At least they were when they left.

276
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,460
How can you know?

277
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,780
By the look of this place...

278
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,400
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

279
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
They packed some clothes.
Not a lot.

280
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,100
But enough to travel.

281
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,810
You know anybody could've broken
in here and stolen clothes, right?

282
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:57,330
You see the framed
photos on the walls?

283
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,480
Neither do I.

284
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Some random thief took
those too, you think?

285
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:08,720
My photo albums,
family pictures, all gone.

286
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,210
Photo albums...

287
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,890
My wife... Same thing...

288
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,390
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

289
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,540
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

290
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,650
That's right.

291
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,770
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

292
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,990
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

293
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,920
Military protection food,
shelter... They told people to go there.

294
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,040
Said to be safest.

295
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:51,180
Plus they got that disease place.

296
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,860
Center for Disease Control.

297
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,040
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

298
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,320
Gas and light have been
down for maybe a month.

299
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,420
Station got its own
propane system.

300
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,360
Pilot's still on.

301
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh, my Lord.

302
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,630
Hot water!

303
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,120
That feels good, right?

304
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,850
♪ Bring it, bring it, bring it around...
Ahah. ♪

305
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,880
♪ What did you say, what...♪

306
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:55,811
Dwayne... Dress in
room back there.

307
00:39:57,151 --> 00:40:00,341
- What would you say, Dwayne?
- Thank you.

308
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:08,161
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

309
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:11,541
Safer anyway. People...

310
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,171
That's where we were heading.

311
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,631
Things got crazy.

312
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:17,021
Man, you won't believe.

313
00:40:17,071 --> 00:40:17,985
The panic...

314
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:21,641
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

315
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:25,411
My wife... couldn't travel.

316
00:40:25,501 --> 00:40:28,981
No, not with our herds,
so we had to find a place to lay low.

317
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:31,801
And then, after she died...

318
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:36,521
We just stayed hunkered down.

319
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:40,281
I guess we just froze in place.

320
00:40:42,031 --> 00:40:43,951
Plan to move on?

321
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,611
Haven't worked up to it yet.

322
00:40:57,641 --> 00:40:59,861
A lot of it's gone missing.

323
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,341
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

324
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:03,891
I'm old enough.

325
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,251
Hell yes you're going to learn.

326
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,681
We gotta do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

327
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:09,781
That's right. It's not a toy.

328
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:11,611
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

329
00:41:11,612 --> 00:41:13,111
Always remember that, Dwayne.

330
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,781
Yes, sir.

331
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:18,201
Here.

332
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:21,671
Go on.

333
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:27,001
Take that one.

334
00:41:27,081 --> 00:41:28,651
Nothing fancy.

335
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:30,721
Scope's accurate.

336
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,811
Conserve your ammo.

337
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:48,571
Goes faster than you think.
Especially at target practice.

338
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,031
Dwayne.

339
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:53,381
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

340
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:56,541
You sure you won't come along?

341
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:57,691
A few more days...

342
00:41:57,692 --> 00:42:01,811
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

343
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:10,591
You got one better.

344
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:13,371
I'll turn mine on,
a few minutes every day at dawn.

345
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,071
You get up there,
that's how you find me.

346
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:17,731
You think they're here?

347
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:20,001
Can't afford not to. Not anymore.

348
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:22,311
Look, just one thing.

349
00:42:22,381 --> 00:42:24,922
They may not seem like
much one at a time...

350
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:27,291
but in a group all
round up and hungry...

351
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,041
Man, you watch your ass.

352
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:30,781
You too.

353
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:33,891
You a good man, Rick.

354
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,721
I hope you find your wife and son.

355
00:42:38,461 --> 00:42:40,111
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

356
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:41,991
Take care of your old man.

357
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,681
Yes, sir.

358
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,181
Leon Bessi?

359
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:01,451
Didn't think much of him.

360
00:43:01,551 --> 00:43:06,811
Careless and dumb,
but... can't leave him like this.

361
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:12,061
You know, if they hear the shot.?

362
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:13,841
Let's not be here
when they show up.

363
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:16,281
Let's go, son. Come on.

364
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:51,561
Read your comic books a while.

365
00:44:51,621 --> 00:44:53,671
Daddy'll be upstairs.

366
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,101
Daddy?

367
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:57,841
It's alright, Dwayne.

368
00:46:57,911 --> 00:47:01,141
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

369
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:31,651
Come on, baby.

370
00:48:02,461 --> 00:48:05,361
I'm sorry this happened to you.

371
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,941
Come on, come on.

372
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,512
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

373
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:59,492
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

374
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:02,682
Anybody reads, please respond.

375
00:50:04,622 --> 00:50:06,522
Hello. Hello.

376
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:09,102
Can anybody hear my voice?

377
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:14,902
Anybody out there? Anybody hears me,
please respond.

378
00:50:16,942 --> 00:50:18,912
Hello, can you hear my voice?

379
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:22,012
Hello? Hello?
Can anybody hear my voice?

380
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:25,672
Yes, I can hear you.

381
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,742
You're coming through. Over.

382
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,662
Anybody who reads, please respond.

383
00:50:31,052 --> 00:50:33,162
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

384
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:36,032
We'll be approaching
Atlanta on Highway 85.

385
00:50:36,112 --> 00:50:38,422
Anybody reads, please respond.

386
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,872
We're just outside the city.

387
00:50:44,312 --> 00:50:45,882
Damn it.

388
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:48,472
Hello? Hello?

389
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:50,212
He couldn't hear me.
I couldn't warn him.

390
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:51,572
Try to raise him again.

391
00:50:51,622 --> 00:50:53,962
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

392
00:50:56,552 --> 00:50:59,092
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

393
00:51:02,342 --> 00:51:03,432
This is officer Shane Walsh,

394
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:06,082
broadcasting a person unknown,
please respond.

395
00:51:13,182 --> 00:51:14,712
He's gone.

396
00:51:16,252 --> 00:51:17,442
There are others.

397
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:18,882
It's not just us.

398
00:51:18,932 --> 00:51:19,712
Yeah, We knew there
would be, right,

399
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,402
that's why we let the CB on.

400
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:23,652
A lot of good it's been doing.

401
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,380
And I've been saying for a week,

402
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:27,070
we ought to put signs up on 85

403
00:51:27,071 --> 00:51:27,972
to warn people away from the city.

404
00:51:28,422 --> 00:51:30,522
Folks got no idea what
they're getting into.

405
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:33,242
We don't have enough time.

406
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:36,182
I think we need to make time.

407
00:51:36,272 --> 00:51:40,012
Yeah, that, uh... That's
a luxury we can't afford.

408
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,772
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

409
00:51:43,402 --> 00:51:45,352
And who the hell would
you propose to send?

410
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:47,282
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

411
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:49,612
Nobody goes anywhere alone,
you know that.

412
00:51:55,302 --> 00:51:56,572
Yes, sir.

413
00:51:56,632 --> 00:51:58,502
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
take a sit, buddy.

414
00:51:58,552 --> 00:52:00,562
You're alright, go on,
you're alright.

415
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:05,772
What, you're pissed at me?

416
00:52:08,332 --> 00:52:10,922
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

417
00:52:12,872 --> 00:52:14,732
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

418
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,432
I'm not doing it for anything.

419
00:52:16,522 --> 00:52:17,530
I make you feel like

420
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:19,902
sometimes you wanna slap
me outside the head...

421
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:20,635
I'll tell you what, girl.

422
00:52:20,636 --> 00:52:22,002
You feel that need,
you go right ahead.

423
00:52:22,052 --> 00:52:23,582
I'm right here.

424
00:52:26,112 --> 00:52:30,712
You cannot walk off like that,
all half-cocked.

425
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:33,153
Look, if you don't wanna do it
for my sake or for your sake,

426
00:52:33,154 --> 00:52:33,732
that's fine.

427
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:37,342
But just... You do it for him.

428
00:52:38,372 --> 00:52:40,852
That boy has been
through too much.

429
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,622
And he's not losing
his mother too, ok?

430
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:47,332
- Okay.
- Ok, fine.

431
00:52:51,112 --> 00:52:53,282
You tell me okay.

432
00:52:59,882 --> 00:53:01,262
It's not hard.

433
00:53:20,402 --> 00:53:21,782
Mom?

434
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,312
What's up, buddy?
She's in there, go on.

435
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:32,062
I don't want you to worry.

436
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,042
Your mom is not going
anywhere. Okay?

437
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:37,212
Yeah? Yeah?

438
00:53:37,272 --> 00:53:39,382
- Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

439
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,590
Hello?

440
00:54:25,666 --> 00:54:27,516
Police officer out here.

441
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:32,536
Can I borrow some gas?

442
00:54:40,956 --> 00:54:42,116
Hello?

443
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,916
Hello? Anybody home?

444
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,836
Easy now, easy.

445
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:41,866
I'm not gonna hurt you.

446
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:43,966
Nothing like that.

447
00:56:45,406 --> 00:56:48,516
More like a proposal.

448
00:56:48,796 --> 00:56:50,646
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

449
00:56:50,716 --> 00:56:52,006
It's safe there.

450
00:56:52,086 --> 00:56:56,526
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

451
00:56:58,486 --> 00:57:00,376
How's that sound?

452
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:06,566
There we go. Good boy. Good boy.

453
00:57:06,626 --> 00:57:09,426
Now come with me. Come with me.

454
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,126
Let's go easy, ok?

455
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:24,686
I haven't done this for years.

456
00:57:29,346 --> 00:57:35,686
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

457
00:59:47,129 --> 00:59:50,969
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

458
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:02,589
Okay.

459
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,919
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

460
01:05:08,769 --> 01:05:10,489
Hey, you.

461
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:14,729
Dumb ass.

462
01:05:15,809 --> 01:05:17,849
Hey, you in the tank.

463
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:19,869
Cozy in there?

464
01:05:40,699 --> 01:05:50,899
