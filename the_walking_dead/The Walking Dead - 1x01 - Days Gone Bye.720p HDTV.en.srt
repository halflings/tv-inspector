1
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,618
Little girl?

2
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:38,989
I'm a policeman.

3
00:03:39,682 --> 00:03:40,771
Little girl.

4
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,804
Don't be afraid.

5
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:51,816
Little girl.

8
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,868
What's the difference
between men and women?

9
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:10,328
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

10
00:05:11,903 --> 00:05:14,002
I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

11
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,984
They're born thinking in a switch,
it only goes one way.

12
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:17,860
On.

13
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:21,678
They're struck blind the
second they leave a room.

14
00:05:22,283 --> 00:05:24,886
I mean every woman, I ever let
have a key... I swear to God.

15
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:27,385
Come home,

16
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:29,257
house all lit up,

17
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,433
and my job, apparently because...

18
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:34,636
because my chromosomes happen
to be different

19
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:36,716
cause I then gotta walk through that house,

20
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:39,661
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

21
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,983
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

22
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,783
Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching
to you now, boy.

23
00:05:46,651 --> 00:05:49,239
The same chick, mind ya.

24
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:51,763
She'll bitch about global warming.

25
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:55,060
That's when Reverend Shane wants to

26
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:58,317
quote from the Guy Gospel and
say "Um, darling?"

27
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,072
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

28
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,952
just figured out that the light switch

29
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,408
see, goes both ways,

30
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:08,088
"maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

31
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,706
- You say that?
- Yeah.

32
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,177
Anyway, uh...

33
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,458
Polite version...

34
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,038
Still man, that... that earns me this.

35
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,018
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

36
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,877
And that's when
the exorcist voice pops out.

37
00:06:21,997 --> 00:06:24,452
"You sound just like my damn father.

38
00:06:24,995 --> 00:06:27,608
"Always, always yelling about the power bill,

39
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,514
"telling me to turn off the damn lights."

40
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,691
- What do you say to that?
- You know what I wanna say.

41
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:35,597
I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me
you've been hearing this your entire life

42
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,535
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

43
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:41,815
You know...

44
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,029
I don't actually say that, tho.

45
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:47,048
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

46
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,420
the polite version there...

47
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,384
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

48
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,290
So how's it with Lori, man?

49
00:06:59,062 --> 00:07:01,248
She's good.
She's good at turning off lights.

50
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:04,333
Really good. I don't know
why I sometimes forget.

51
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,539
Not what I meant.

52
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:13,423
- We didn't have a great night.
- Look, man, I may have a...

53
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,704
fail to amuse with my sermon,
but I did try.

54
00:07:17,732 --> 00:07:19,863
The least you could do is speak.

55
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:26,650
That's what she always says:
"Speak". "Speak".

56
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:31,588
You'd think I was the most closed mouth
son of a bitch you'd ever *** telling.

57
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,934
Do you express your thoughts?

58
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:39,620
You share your feelings and that kind of stuff?

59
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:42,970
The thing is...

60
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,876
lately whenever I try...

61
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,212
everything I say makes her impatient,

62
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,114
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

63
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,607
It's like she's...

64
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,162
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

65
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,087
Look, man, that's just shit
couples go through.

66
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,117
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

67
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:11,903
- Last thing she said this morning?
- Mm?

68
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,417
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

69
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,479
She said that in front of our kid.

70
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:24,438
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

71
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,450
Difference between men and women?

72
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:35,004
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

73
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,956
Certainly not in front of Carl.

74
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:47,043
All available units, high speed
pursuit in progress

75
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,160
Lincoln county units
request local assistance.

76
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,717
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

77
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,235
Proceed with extreme caution.

78
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,960
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

79
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,055
Be advised, they have fired
on police officers.

80
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,161
One Lindon county officer is wounded.

81
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:26,517
Unit 1, Unit 3, please.

82
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:31,076
18, 2 miles west of lnterstate 85
and we'll patch in Lindon County Sheriff radio.

83
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,446
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

84
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:39,935
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3, we are 10-97
in code 100.

85
00:09:40,055 --> 00:09:42,620
Highway 18, 85 Interstate, please advise.

86
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,686
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

87
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,710
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

88
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,780
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

89
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:08,891
What I think, Leon, is that
you need to stay focused.

90
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:11,644
Make sure you got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

91
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:21,299
Would be kind of cool to get on
one of them shows.

92
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:09,910
Holy shit.

93
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,012
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

94
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:36,918
Put the gun down!

95
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:12,841
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

96
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:20,016
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

97
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,010
Me too.

98
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,587
Son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

99
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,122
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:29,392
Yeah.

101
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:34,351
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

102
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,005
You understand... Aah!

103
00:12:38,313 --> 00:12:40,929
Rick! Rick!
No, no, no!

104
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,105
Shh, shh, shh.

105
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,503
No, no, no, no...

106
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,661
He's hurt!

107
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:48,293
Leon!

108
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,997
You get that ambulance down here, you tell
them there's an officer down, you do it now!

109
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:56,727
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me? Shh, shh. okay.

110
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,708
Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:01,772
Shh, shh, ok?

112
00:13:01,892 --> 00:13:03,605
You stay with me, ok?

113
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:22,108
Hey, bud...

114
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,444
We're still here.

115
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,904
We're still hanging in.

116
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:33,625
Look, I'm sorry, man.

117
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,238
I'm mean watching the same crap
every time I come in here.

118
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,990
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...

119
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:46,009
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

120
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,472
They hope you come back real soon.

121
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,451
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

122
00:13:56,683 --> 00:13:57,762
You probably could tell, hmm?

123
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,823
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?

124
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,642
That vase has something special.

125
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:19,395
Fess up. Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

126
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,863
I hope you left her that spoon collection.

127
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,494
Shane?

128
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,654
Shane, you in the john?

129
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,143
Nurse, help.

130
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,291
Nurse.

131
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:02,824
Help!

132
00:23:49,852 --> 00:23:51,192
Lori!

133
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,342
Lori!

134
00:24:02,537 --> 00:24:03,892
Carl!

135
00:24:04,537 --> 00:24:05,752
Carl!

136
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:14,622
Lori! Carl!

137
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:31,916
Lori! Carl!

138
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:52,062
Is this real?
Am I here?

139
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:00,647
Wake, wake up!

140
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,717
- Daddy, daddy!
- Carl...

141
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:18,918
Carl?

142
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:20,413
I found you...

143
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,785
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

144
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,007
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

145
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:35,703
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

146
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:36,733
Hey, mister!

147
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,903
What's that bandage for?

148
00:26:41,052 --> 00:26:42,914
- What?
- What kind of wound?

149
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,030
You answer me, damn you!

150
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,122
What's your wound?

151
00:26:49,712 --> 00:26:50,952
You tell me!

152
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:53,192
Or I will kill you.

153
00:27:17,556 --> 00:27:20,968
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.

154
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,602
What was? The wound?

155
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:27,995
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:29,302 --> 00:27:30,919
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:33,592
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:37,911
Look, I ask and you answer,

159
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:40,082
It's common courtesy, right?

160
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:46,386
Did you get bit?

161
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,412
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

162
00:27:50,824 --> 00:27:53,044
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.

163
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,552
No, I got shot.

164
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:58,699
- Just shot?
- As far as I know.

165
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:03,245
Hey...

166
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:04,512
Just let me...

167
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:09,562
Feels cooler now.

168
00:28:10,448 --> 00:28:12,148
Fever would have killed you by now.

169
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,902
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:23,493
Take a moment, eh?

171
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:25,062
Look how sharp it is.

172
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:27,944
You try anything...

173
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:31,454
I will kill you with it,
and don't you think I won't.

174
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,687
Come on up when you're able.

175
00:28:48,711 --> 00:28:49,409
Come on.

176
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,966
This place...

177
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,106
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.

178
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:27,246
Never met them.

179
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:30,228
I've been here. This is their place

180
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,597
It was empty when we got here.

181
00:29:35,946 --> 00:29:37,056
Don't do that.

182
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,946
They'll see the light.

183
00:29:39,766 --> 00:29:41,314
There's more of them out there than usual.

184
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,034
I never should have fired that gun today.

185
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,421
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

186
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:52,286
Stupid... using a gun...

187
00:29:53,388 --> 00:29:55,240
It all happened so fast...

188
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:58,994
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

189
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:00,666
Man?

190
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,795
- No man... - What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

191
00:30:04,866 --> 00:30:06,753
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

192
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,706
In this street, out front, a man.

193
00:30:08,744 --> 00:30:11,028
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

194
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:12,716
Come on.

195
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,473
Sit down, before you fall down.

196
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:19,786
Here. Eat.

197
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:23,286
Daddy...

198
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:25,456
Blessing...

199
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:28,505
Yeah.

200
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,916
Father, we thank thee for this food...

201
00:30:44,237 --> 00:30:45,326
Thy blessings...

202
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,326
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.

203
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:50,468
- Amen.
- Amen.

204
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,582
Hey, mister, do you even know
what is going on?

205
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:01,526
I woke up today.

206
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,116
In a hospital.

207
00:31:06,046 --> 00:31:07,721
Came home, that's all I know.

208
00:31:11,796 --> 00:31:14,580
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

209
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:18,246
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.

210
00:31:18,366 --> 00:31:19,286
No...

211
00:31:19,766 --> 00:31:21,028
Not the one's they put down...

212
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:23,273
The one's they didn't. The walkers.

213
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:26,186
Like the one I shot today.

214
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:28,206
Cause he would have ripped into you.

215
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:31,055
Try to eat you, take him
some flesh at least.

216
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,693
But I guess if this is the first
you're hearing,

217
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,931
I know how it must sound...

218
00:31:40,396 --> 00:31:42,649
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

219
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:46,013
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

220
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:48,144
Maybe it's the cool air or...

221
00:31:48,264 --> 00:31:50,602
Hell, maybe it's just me
firing up that gun today.

222
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,908
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.

223
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:56,308
Probably wander off by morning.

224
00:31:58,876 --> 00:31:59,906
Well, listen...

225
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:03,046
One thing I do know...

226
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,266
Don't you get bit!

227
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,559
We saw your bandage
and that's why we were afraid of.

228
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:11,306
Bites kill you.

229
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,330
The fever... burns you out.

230
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,976
But then after a while...

231
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:18,186
You come back.

232
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:25,666
Seen it happen...

233
00:32:31,394 --> 00:32:32,506
Come on...

234
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:41,866
Carl...

235
00:32:43,136 --> 00:32:44,336
He your son?

236
00:32:45,236 --> 00:32:46,196
William..

237
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,710
He said his name today...

238
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:51,763
He's a little younger...

239
00:32:52,266 --> 00:32:53,256
than your boy.

240
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,046
And he's with his mother?

241
00:32:57,296 --> 00:32:58,486
I hope so.

242
00:33:00,332 --> 00:33:02,565
- Dad?
- Yeah?

243
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:05,516
Did you ask him?

244
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,076
Your gun shot...

245
00:33:10,596 --> 00:33:12,607
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a...

246
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:14,745
bank robber...

247
00:33:16,156 --> 00:33:17,396
Yeah...

248
00:33:18,182 --> 00:33:21,924
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Kapow.

249
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,276
Sheriff's deputy.

250
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:26,874
Aha.

251
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,590
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

252
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:33,966
It's nothing.

253
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:37,505
One of them must've bumped a car...

254
00:33:37,899 --> 00:33:41,007
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

255
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:43,890
Went off a few minutes.

256
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:47,496
Get the light, Dwayne.

257
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:03,697
It's the blue one, down the street.

258
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:05,996
Same one as last time.

259
00:34:06,636 --> 00:34:08,116
I think we're ok.

260
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:12,516
That noise...

261
00:34:12,846 --> 00:34:14,326
Will it bring more of them?

262
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:16,492
Nothing to do about it now.

263
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,486
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.

264
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:25,536
She's here.

265
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,740
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

266
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:32,316
I said go! Come on!

267
00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:42,271
Come on, quiet.

268
00:34:42,842 --> 00:34:45,379
Shh, shh...

269
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,706
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.

270
00:35:07,826 --> 00:35:09,044
Can you remember?

271
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,001
Shh...

272
00:35:49,446 --> 00:35:50,456
She, uh...

273
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:56,109
She died in the other room, on that bed...

274
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:01,556
Nothin' I can do about it here...

275
00:36:02,136 --> 00:36:03,516
That fever, man...

276
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:07,329
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...

277
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:18,268
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

278
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:21,554
You know what...

279
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,391
I just didn't have it in me...

280
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,117
She's the mother of my child.

281
00:36:56,265 --> 00:36:58,297
- You sure?
- They're dead.

282
00:36:58,994 --> 00:37:01,420
They have to ask, at least one more time.

283
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:05,495
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.

284
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,661
That's why it's gotta be the head.

285
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:33,826
You alright?

286
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,966
Need a moment?

287
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,096
They're alive.

288
00:37:44,216 --> 00:37:45,776
My wife and son.

289
00:37:46,246 --> 00:37:47,776
At least they were when they left.

290
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:49,266
How can you know?

291
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:53,503
- By the look of this place...
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

292
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,786
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.

293
00:37:56,142 --> 00:37:57,266
But enough to travel.

294
00:37:57,806 --> 00:38:00,751
You know anybody could've broken in here
and stolen clothes, right?

295
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:03,486
You see the framed photos on the walls?

296
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:08,323
Neither do I. Some random thief
took those too, you think?

297
00:38:12,546 --> 00:38:15,454
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.

298
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,387
Photo albums...

299
00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:25,506
My wife...

300
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:27,746
Same thing...

301
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,048
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

302
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:39,506
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

303
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,666
That's right.

304
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:45,474
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

305
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:47,872
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

306
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:51,382
Military protection, food, shelter...

307
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,486
They told people to go there.

308
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:55,246
Said to be safest.

309
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,372
Plus they got that disease place.

310
00:38:57,774 --> 00:38:59,220
Center for Disease Control.

311
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,366
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

312
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,384
Gas and light have been down
for maybe a month.

313
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,883
Station got its own propane system.

314
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,111
Pilot's still on.

315
00:39:42,765 --> 00:39:44,097
Oh, my Lord.

316
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:45,987
Hot water!

317
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:48,270
- Whoo!
- That feels good, right?

318
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,121
Dwayne...

319
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,032
Dress in room back there.

320
00:40:04,131 --> 00:40:05,367
What you say, Dwayne?

321
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:07,271
Thank you.

322
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,711
Mhm.

323
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,762
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

324
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:17,528
Safer anyway. People...

325
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:20,291
That's where we were heading.

326
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:24,077
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.

327
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,092
The panic...

328
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:27,762
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

329
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:30,991
My wife...

330
00:40:31,861 --> 00:40:33,696
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,

331
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:35,459
so we had to find a place to lay low.

332
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:37,797
And then, after she died...

333
00:40:40,986 --> 00:40:42,471
We just stayed hunkered down.

334
00:40:45,413 --> 00:40:47,240
I guess we just froze in place.

335
00:40:49,178 --> 00:40:50,421
Plan to move on?

336
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,096
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*)

337
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:06,233
A lot of it's gone missing.

338
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:09,166
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

339
00:41:09,286 --> 00:41:10,752
I'm old enough.

340
00:41:10,872 --> 00:41:12,223
Hell yes you're going to learn.

341
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:14,704
We gotta do it carefully, teach you
to respect the weapon.

342
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:16,631
That's right. It's not a toy.

343
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:20,219
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.

344
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:21,272
Yes, sir.

345
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,708
Here.

346
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:27,359
Go on.

347
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,076
Take that one.

348
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:35,403
Nothing fancy.

349
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:37,321
Scope's accurate.

350
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:55,236
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than
you think. Especially at target practice.

351
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,651
Dwayne.

352
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,718
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

353
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,771
You sure you won't come along?

354
00:42:03,743 --> 00:42:04,961
A few more days...

355
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:08,333
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

356
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:17,152
You got one better.

357
00:42:18,027 --> 00:42:20,488
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes
every day at dawn.

358
00:42:20,608 --> 00:42:23,063
You get up there, that's how you find me.

359
00:42:23,725 --> 00:42:26,051
- You think they're here?
- Can't afford not to.

360
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:29,079
- Not anymore.
- Look, just one thing.

361
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:31,479
They may not seem
like much one at a time...

362
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,898
but in a group all round up and hungry...

363
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,931
- They you watch your ass.
- You too.

364
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:40,541
You a good man, Rick.

365
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:42,662
I hope you find your wife and son.

366
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,751
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

367
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:49,762
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:43:00,631 --> 00:43:02,713
Leon Bessi?

369
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,201
Didn't think much of him.

370
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:10,244
Careless and dumb, but...

371
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:13,291
can't leave him like this.

372
00:43:17,114 --> 00:43:18,431
You know, if they hear the shot..?

373
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:21,719
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son.

374
00:43:22,191 --> 00:43:23,071
Come on.

375
00:44:56,482 --> 00:44:58,221
Read your comic books a while.

376
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,072
Daddy'll be upstairs.

377
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:04,499
- Daddy?
- It's alright, Dwayne.

378
00:47:05,045 --> 00:47:07,310
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

379
00:47:36,795 --> 00:47:38,102
Come on, baby.

380
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:11,816
I'm sorry this happened to you.

381
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,604
Come on, come on.

382
00:50:00,976 --> 00:50:02,803
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

383
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:05,517
We'll be approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

384
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:08,729
Anybody reads, please respond.

385
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,796
Hello. Hello.

386
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:14,556
Can anybody hear my voice?

387
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:20,845
Anybody out there?
Anybody hears me, please respond.

388
00:50:23,116 --> 00:50:24,778
Hello, can you hear my voice?

389
00:50:25,184 --> 00:50:27,976
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear my voice?

390
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:30,588
Hey? Hello?

391
00:50:31,082 --> 00:50:32,731
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes, I can hear you.

392
00:50:32,851 --> 00:50:34,089
You're coming through. Over.

393
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:36,933
Anybody who reads, please respond.

394
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:39,174
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

395
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,535
We'll be approaching Atlanta
on Highway 85.

396
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:44,696
Anybody reads, please respond.

397
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:49,553
We're just outside the city.

398
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:51,386
Damnit.

399
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:53,016
Hello?

400
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:54,536
Hello?

401
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:56,612
He couldn't hear me. I couldn't warn him.

402
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,656
Try to raise him again.

403
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,071
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

404
00:51:03,056 --> 00:51:05,544
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

405
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:12,680
This is officer Shane Walsh, broadcasting
a person unknown, please respond.

406
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:20,360
He's gone.

407
00:51:22,658 --> 00:51:24,766
There are others. It's not just us.

408
00:51:25,071 --> 00:51:27,430
Yeah, We knew there would be, right,
that's why we let the CB on.

409
00:51:28,277 --> 00:51:29,686
Lot of good it's been doing.

410
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:32,895
And I've been saying for a week,
we ought to put signs up on 85

411
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,388
to warn people away from the city.

412
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:36,789
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

413
00:51:37,271 --> 00:51:38,742
We don't have enough time.

414
00:51:40,517 --> 00:51:41,811
I think we need to make time.

415
00:51:42,206 --> 00:51:43,737
Yeah, that, uh...

416
00:51:44,356 --> 00:51:45,843
That's a luxury we can't afford.

417
00:51:46,477 --> 00:51:48,684
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

418
00:51:49,886 --> 00:51:51,700
And who the hell would you propose to send?

419
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,640
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

420
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,733
Nobody goes anywhere alone, you know that.

421
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:02,346
Yes, sir.

422
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:06,283
Hey, hey, hey, come on, take a sit, buddy.
You're alright, go on, you're alright.

423
00:52:10,775 --> 00:52:11,876
What, you're pissed at me?

424
00:52:14,795 --> 00:52:16,976
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

425
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:22,358
I'm not putting you in danger, okay?
I'm not doing it for anything.

426
00:52:22,822 --> 00:52:26,279
I make you feel like sometimes you wanna
slap me outside the head...

427
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:29,007
I'll tell you what, girl. You feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

428
00:52:32,488 --> 00:52:34,822
You cannot walk off like that,

429
00:52:35,063 --> 00:52:36,890
all half-cocked.

430
00:52:37,346 --> 00:52:40,148
Look, if you don't wanna do it for
my sake or for your sake, that's fine.

431
00:52:40,195 --> 00:52:41,087
But just...

432
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,096
You do it for him.

433
00:52:44,618 --> 00:52:46,280
That boy has been through too much.

434
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:49,165
And he's not losing his mother too, ok?

435
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:51,226
Okay.

436
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:53,643
Ok, fine.

437
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,646
You tell me okay.

438
00:53:06,056 --> 00:53:07,146
It's not hard.

439
00:53:11,043 --> 00:53:12,007
Hey...

440
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,987
Mom?

441
00:53:31,805 --> 00:53:33,607
What's up, buddy? She's in there, go on.

442
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:36,499
Hey.

443
00:53:37,108 --> 00:53:39,607
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

444
00:53:39,727 --> 00:53:40,672
Okay?

445
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:44,872
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

446
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:30,026
Hello?

447
00:54:32,216 --> 00:54:33,890
Police officer out here.

448
00:54:36,641 --> 00:54:37,948
Can I borrow some gas?

449
00:54:47,196 --> 00:54:48,236
Hello?

450
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,116
Hello?

451
00:54:56,386 --> 00:54:57,376
Anybody home?

452
00:56:44,274 --> 00:56:45,732
Easy now, easy.

453
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:47,346
I'm not gonna hurt you.

454
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:49,496
Nothing like that.

455
00:56:52,036 --> 00:56:53,465
More like a proposal.

456
00:56:55,476 --> 00:56:56,926
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

457
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,109
It's safe there.

458
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:02,879
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

459
00:57:04,758 --> 00:57:06,026
How's that sound?

460
00:57:07,472 --> 00:57:09,210
There we go. Good boy.

461
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:15,311
Good boy. Now come with me.
Come with me.

462
00:57:26,986 --> 00:57:30,796
Let's go easy, ok?
I haven't done this for years.

463
00:57:36,042 --> 00:57:41,592
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

464
00:57:59,033 --> 00:58:01,312
Let's go.

465
00:59:54,082 --> 00:59:57,353
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

466
01:00:07,643 --> 01:00:09,323
Okay, whoa whoa whoa.

467
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:51,203
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

468
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,564
Hey, you.

469
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:19,855
Dumb ass.

470
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:23,635
Hey, you in the tank.

471
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:25,556
Cozy in there?
