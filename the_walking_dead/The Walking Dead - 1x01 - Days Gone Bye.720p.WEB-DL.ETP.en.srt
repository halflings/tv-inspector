1
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,000
There's a beautiful tone of...

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,930
...regret an longing 
in that first episode.

3
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,150
That's what it feels
 like for this characters.

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,990
They all need to hold
 on to one another.

5
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,270
If one brakes, if the chain 
brakes then there are all at risk.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,960
We're getting this slice
 of his life of normality.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,040
And then...

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,740
Rick!

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,590
When he wakes up 
he is tying to work out...

10
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,460
...whether or not
 he is still in a coma.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,340
If it's some horrendous dream.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,750
We're able to see the 
zombie apocalypse...

13
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,190
...through Rick Grimes eyes.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
Through someone who wakes up...

15
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,890
...to find the world has
 completely changed.

16
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,830
I don't think he's able to comprehend
 the enormous in the scale,

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,990
the vision that he's confronted with.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,790
He's trying to keep it together,
trying to keep his grace...

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,810
...and his good intentions 
intact in the zombie apocalypse.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,200
Lori.

21
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
Lori!

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,860
When he gets home
 there's an unrevealing.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,810
He comes apart.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,430
It's just this horrendous epiphany.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,430
It's actually Morgan that saves him.

26
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,770
What's your wound?

27
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,580
You tell me...

28
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,170
...or I will kill you.

29
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,080
Morgan is wandering
 this new nightmare world...

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,930
...with his ten years old son.

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,140
and still trying to raise his
 son into being a good man.

32
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,330
Sit down, before you fall down.

33
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,770
It's the first human contact Rick has.

34
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,070
He gets fed by these 
people an it's that kernel...

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,890
...of humanity and hope...

36
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,890
...that starts to bring him
 back to the man he is.

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,860
<i>It took my breathe away...</i>

38
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,150
<i>...because it was all about 
what have been lost...</i>

39
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,150
<i>...to what they were 
trying to hold on to.</i>

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,480
From that point there is a 
choice that he mades, he says "no".

41
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,810
As soon as the sheriff badge 
comes back on and the hat...

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,300
...then there is this semblance
 of structure and order.

43
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,630
Then you see that is a
 man that does all he can.

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
From then on.

45
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,250
You're a good man Rick.

46
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,250
I hope you found your wife and son.

47
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,240
Rick's journey is a man's 
search for his family.

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,190
At the beginning of the story...

49
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,490
...he meets the worse 
 side of that search...

50
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,690
...which is what he 
meets in Morgan really.

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,440
This scope is accurate.

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,280
The reality of Morgan world 
is that he is left having to do...

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,310
...what in the surface seems like
 a bad thing for a good reason.

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,240
It's a horrible situation
 for him to be in.

55
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,610
He is a man who has gone through
 the same things that Rick gone through.

56
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,150
But he is a month further
 on. He is a month wiser.

57
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,540
He is a month more prepared.

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:18,680
The way that I see killing the zombies
 justified is about erradicating that.

59
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,590
And reclaiming what his lost.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,730
For the middle of this madness, 
the two man try to do the right thing.

61
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,000
- Come on. - I'm sorry 
this happened to you.

62
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,350
Two men yearning for family.

63
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,920
You always express your thoughts?

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,540
Do you share you feeling,
 that kind of stuff?

65
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,540
Shane has extreme loyalty to Rick.

66
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,980
To a large extent, I think that
 Rick's family is Shane's family.

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,900
When to him Rick was
 not gonna make it...

68
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,070
...It was Shane absoluteley top 
priority to save Lori and Carl.

69
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,070
Nobody goes anywhere
 alone, you know that.

70
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,590
Filling into Rick shoes
 was something that...

71
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,590
..naturally he was doing
 for his friend.

72
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,390
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,790
What's really 
complicated for lori is that...

74
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,920
Rick and Lori marriage 
was under a lot of stress...

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,920
...right before this happened.

76
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,340
Shane has only ever try
 to protect Lori an Carl.

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,010
That boy has been through too much.

78
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,050
He's not losing his mother too, OK?

79
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,210
You get the sense that...

80
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,950
...he is willing to let the rest 
of the world burn to the ground...

81
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,150
...as long as the two of them are safe.

82
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,750
This is a need to physically affirm life...

83
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,150
...when everything surrounding
 us is death and destruction.

84
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,220
We turn this 21st century guy into
 basically a western icon almost...

85
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,530
Is iconic, you know. Man on 
horseback riding into town.

86
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,680
He's going into Atlanta
 with good intentions.

87
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,470
He doesn't know the
 true scale of the epidemic.

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,680
It's only when he arrives
 that he realizes...

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,680
...the enormity of the problem.

90
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,230
Then it's absolutely about survival.

91
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,790
In the middle of a sea of inhumanity...

92
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,530
The spark of the story...

93
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,420
...are the moments of humanity.

94
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Hey, you in the tank...

95
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,420
Cosy in there?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
