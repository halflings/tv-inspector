1
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,734
Little girl?

2
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,105
I'm a policeman.

3
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:56,887
Little girl.

4
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:02,920
Don't be afraid.

5
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:07,932
Little girl.

<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

7
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,260
What's the difference
between men and women?

8
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,720
- Is this a joke?
- No, serious.

9
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,394
I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

10
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:33,376
They're born thinking in a switch,
it only goes one way.

11
00:05:33,496 --> 00:05:34,252
On.

12
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,070
*** blond *** lit room.

13
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,278
I mean every woman, every lady has a ***,
I swear to God.

14
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:43,777
Come home,

15
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:45,649
house all lit up,

16
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,825
and my job, apparently because...

17
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:51,028
because my chromosomes happen
to be different

18
00:05:51,148 --> 00:05:53,108
cause I then gotta walk through that house,

19
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,053
turn off every single
light this chick left on.

20
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,375
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby.

21
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:01,175
Alright, Reverend Shane's preaching
to you now, boy.

22
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,631
The same chick, mind ya.

23
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,155
She'll bitch about global warming.

24
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:11,452
That's when Reverend Shane wants to

25
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:14,709
quote from the Guy Gospel and
say "Um, darling?"

26
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:18,464
"maybe you, and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

27
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:20,344
just figured out that the light switch

28
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,800
see, goes both ways,

29
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,480
"maybe we wouldn't have
so much global warming."

30
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,098
- You say that?
- Yeah.

31
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,569
Anyway, uh...

32
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:28,850
Polite version...

33
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,430
Still man, that... that earns me this.

34
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,410
This look and loathing
you would not believe.

35
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:38,269
And that's when
the exorcist voice pops out.

36
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,844
"You sound just like my damn father.

37
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:44,000
"Always, always yelling about the power bill,

38
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,906
"telling me to turn off the damn lights."

39
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:48,083
- What do you say to that?
- You know what I wanna say.

40
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:51,989
I wanna say, "Bitch, you mean to tell me
you've been hearing this your entire life

41
00:06:52,055 --> 00:06:54,927
"and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?

42
00:06:56,913 --> 00:06:58,207
You know...

43
00:06:58,327 --> 00:07:00,421
I don't actually say that, tho.

44
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,440
- That would be bad.
- Yeah, go with the uh...

45
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,812
the polite version there...

46
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,776
- Very wise.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:07:12,202 --> 00:07:13,682
So how's it with Lori, man?

48
00:07:15,454 --> 00:07:17,640
She's good.
She's good at turning off lights.

49
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,725
Really good. I don't know
why sometimes ***

50
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,931
Not what I meant.

51
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:29,815
- We didn't have a great night.
- Look, man, I may have a...

52
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:33,096
fail to amuse with my sermon,
but I did try.

53
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,255
The least you could do is speak.

54
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:43,042
That's what she always says:
"Speak". "Speak".

55
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,980
You think I was the most closed mouth
son of a bitch you'd ever hear to hear her tell it.

56
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,326
Do you express your thoughts?

57
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,012
You share your feelings and that kind of stuff?

58
00:07:58,233 --> 00:07:59,362
The thing is...

59
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:04,268
lately whenever I try...

60
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:07,604
everything I say makes her impatient,

61
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:09,506
like she didn't want to hear it after all.

62
00:08:10,712 --> 00:08:11,999
It's like she's...

63
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:15,554
pissed at me all the time,
and I don't know why.

64
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:19,479
Look, man, that's just shit
couples go through.

65
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:21,509
Nah, it's... It's a phase.

66
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,295
- Last thing she said this morning?
- Mm?

67
00:08:29,234 --> 00:08:31,809
Sometimes I wonder if you
even care about us at all.

68
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,871
She said that in front of our kid.

69
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,830
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

70
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,842
Difference between men and women?

71
00:08:49,318 --> 00:08:51,396
I would never say something
that cruel to her.

72
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:54,348
Certainly not in front of Carl.

73
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,435
All available units, high speed
pursuit in progress

74
00:09:03,555 --> 00:09:05,552
Lincoln county units
request local assistance.

75
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:10,109
Highway 18 south GTAAD W217 243.

76
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,627
Proceed with extreme caution.

77
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,352
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

78
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:28,447
Be advised, they have fired
on police officers.

79
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,553
One Lindon county officer is wounded.

80
00:09:40,729 --> 00:09:42,909
Unit 1, Unit 3, please ***.

81
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:47,468
18, 2 miles west of lnterstate 85
and we'll patch in Lindon County Sheriff radio.

82
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:51,838
Roger that. We're 5 minutes out
on the route 18 intersection.

83
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,327
Dispatch, Unit 1, Unit 3, we are 10-97
in code 100.

84
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:59,012
Highway 18, *** Interstate, please advise.

85
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,634
***

86
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,078
Sounds like they're chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we got.

87
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:21,102
Hey, we'll get them on one of
those video shows, you know,

88
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,172
like World's craziest police chases,
what do you think?

89
00:10:23,224 --> 00:10:25,283
What I think, Leon, is that
you need to stay focused.

90
00:10:25,575 --> 00:10:28,036
Make sure you got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

91
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:37,691
Would be kind of cool to get on
one of them shows.

92
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:26,302
Holy shit.

93
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,404
- Gun, gun, gun.
- Put it down!

94
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,310
Put the gun down!

95
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,233
- Rick!
- I'm alright!

96
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,408
I saw you get tagged, man,
it scared the hell out of me.

97
00:12:37,311 --> 00:12:38,402
Me too.

98
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:41,979
Son of a bitch shot me.
You believe that?

99
00:12:42,232 --> 00:12:43,514
We'll get you a new vest.

100
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:45,784
Yeah.

101
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,743
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened. Ever.

102
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:52,397
You understand... Aah!

103
00:12:54,705 --> 00:12:57,321
Rick! Rick!
No, no, no!

104
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,497
Shh, shh, shh.

105
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:01,895
No, no, no, no...

106
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,053
He's hurt!

107
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:04,685
***

108
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:08,389
You get that ambulance down here, you tell
them there's an officer down, you do it now!

109
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:13,119
Shh, shh, shh, hey, you look at me,
stay with me, you hear me? Shh, shh. okay.

110
00:13:13,385 --> 00:13:17,100
Shh, shh, stay with me, you hear me?

111
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,164
Shh, shh, ok?

112
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:19,997
You stay with me, ok?

113
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,500
Hey, bud...

114
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,836
We're still here.

115
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,296
We're still hanging in.

116
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:50,017
Look, I'm sorry, man.

117
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:52,630
I'm mean watching the same crap
every time I come in here.

118
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,382
Everybody pitched in on these. They uh...

119
00:14:00,147 --> 00:14:02,401
They wanted me to bring them down,
they send their love and they just...

120
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,864
They hope you come back real soon.

121
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:11,843
Linda and Diane from dispatch,
they picked these out.

122
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,154
You probably could tell, hmm?

123
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,215
I'll just set this on your side table, ok?

124
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:32,034
That vase has something special.

125
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:35,787
Fess up. Did you steal it from
your Grandma Gene's house.

126
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:39,255
I hope you left her that spoon collection.

127
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,886
Shane?

128
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,046
Shane, you in the john?

129
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:14,535
Nurse, help.

130
00:16:16,612 --> 00:16:17,683
Nurse.

131
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,216
Help!

132
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,100
Lori!

133
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,250
Lori!

134
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:22,800
Carl!

135
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:24,660
Carl!

136
00:24:30,685 --> 00:24:33,530
Lori! Carl!

137
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,824
Lori! Carl!

138
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,970
Is this real?
Am I here?

139
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,555
Wake, wake up!

140
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,625
- Daddy, daddy!
- Carl...

141
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:37,826
Carl?

142
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,321
I found you...

143
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:41,693
Daddy, I got this sumbitch.
I'm gonna smack him dead.

144
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,915
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

145
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:54,611
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

146
00:26:54,731 --> 00:26:55,641
Hey, mister!

147
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,811
What's that bandage for?

148
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,822
- What?
- What kind of wound?

149
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,938
You answer me, damn you!

150
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:07,030
What's your wound?

151
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,860
You tell me!

152
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,100
Or I will kill you.

153
00:27:36,694 --> 00:27:40,106
Got that bandage changed out.
It was pretty rank.

154
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:43,740
What was? The wound?

155
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:47,133
- Gun shot.
- Gun shot?

156
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,057
What else? Anything?

157
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,730
Gun shot ain't enough?

158
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,049
Look, I ask and you answer,

159
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,220
It's common courtesy, right?

160
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,524
Did you get bit?

161
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,550
- Bit?
- Bit. Chewed.

162
00:28:09,962 --> 00:28:12,182
Maybe scratch? Anything like that.

163
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:14,690
No, I got shot.

164
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,837
- Just shot?
- As far as I know.

165
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:22,383
Hey...

166
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,650
Just let me...

167
00:28:27,442 --> 00:28:28,700
Feels cooler now.

168
00:28:29,586 --> 00:28:31,286
Fever would have killed you by now.

169
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:35,040
- I don't think I have one.
- Be hard to miss.

170
00:28:41,585 --> 00:28:42,631
Take a moment, eh?

171
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,200
Look how sharp it is.

172
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,082
You try anything...

173
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,592
I will kill you with it,
and don't you think I won't.

174
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,825
Come on up when you're able.

175
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:08,547
Come on.

176
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,780
This place...

177
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:44,920
It's Fred and Cindy Drake's.

178
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,060
Never met them.

179
00:29:47,771 --> 00:29:50,042
I've been here. This is their place

180
00:29:50,433 --> 00:29:52,411
It was empty when we got here.

181
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,870
Don't do that.

182
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,760
They'll see the light.

183
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,128
There's more of them out there than usual.

184
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,848
I never should have fired that gun today.

185
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:08,235
The sound draws them,
now they're all over the street.

186
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:12,100
Stupid... using a gun...

187
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,054
It all happened so fast...

188
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:18,808
- I didn't think.
- You shot that man today.

189
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:20,480
Man?

190
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,609
- No man... - What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

191
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,567
- It wasn't a man.
- You shot him.

192
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:28,520
In this street, out front, a man.

193
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:30,842
For him, you need glasses,
that was a walker.

194
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:32,530
Come on.

195
00:30:34,093 --> 00:30:36,287
Sit down, before you fall down.

196
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
Here. Eat.

197
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,100
Daddy...

198
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,270
Blessing...

199
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,319
Yeah.

200
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,730
Father, we thank thee for this food...

201
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:05,140
Thy blessings...

202
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,140
We ask you to watch over us in these crazy days.

203
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,282
- Amen.
- Amen.

204
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,396
Hey, mister, do you even know
what is going on?

205
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,340
I woke up today.

206
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,930
In a hospital.

207
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,535
Came home, that's all I know.

208
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,394
- But you know about the dead people, right?
- Yeah, I saw a lot of that.

209
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:38,060
Out on the loading dock, hauling trucks.

210
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,100
No...

211
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,842
Not the one's they put down...

212
00:31:41,121 --> 00:31:43,087
The one's they didn't. The walkers.

213
00:31:44,477 --> 00:31:46,000
Like the one I shot today.

214
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:48,020
Cause he would have ripped into you.

215
00:31:48,497 --> 00:31:50,869
Try to eat you, take him
some flesh at least.

216
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:54,507
But I guess if this is the first
you're hearing,

217
00:31:55,134 --> 00:31:56,745
I know how it must sound...

218
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,463
- They're out there now, in the street?
- Yeah.

219
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,827
They're even more active
after dark sometimes.

220
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,958
Maybe it's the cool air or...

221
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:10,416
Hell, maybe it's just me
firing up that gun today.

222
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:13,722
But we'll be fine long as we stay quiet.

223
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,122
Probably wander off by morning.

224
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,720
Well, listen...

225
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:22,860
One thing I do know...

226
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,080
Don't you get bit!

227
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,373
We saw your bandage
and that's why we were afraid of.

228
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:31,120
Bites kill you.

229
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:33,144
The fever... burns you out.

230
00:32:33,264 --> 00:32:34,790
But then after a while...

231
00:32:37,113 --> 00:32:38,000
You come back.

232
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:45,480
Seen it happen...

233
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,320
Come on...

234
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,680
Carl...

235
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,150
He your son?

236
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,010
William..

237
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,524
He said his name today...

238
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,577
He's a little younger...

239
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,070
than your boy.

240
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:14,860
And he's with his mother?

241
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,300
I hope so.

242
00:33:20,146 --> 00:33:22,379
- Dad?
- Yeah?

243
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,330
Did you ask him?

244
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:29,890
Your gun shot...

245
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,421
We got a little bet going.
My boy say you're a...

246
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,559
bank robber...

247
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,210
Yeah...

248
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:41,738
That's me. Deadly as Dillinger.
Kapow.

249
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,090
Sheriff's deputy.

250
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:46,688
Aha.

251
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:52,404
Hey, it's ok, daddy's here.

252
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,780
It's nothing.

253
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,319
One of them must've bumped a car...

254
00:33:57,713 --> 00:34:00,821
- You sure?
- Happened once before.

255
00:34:01,966 --> 00:34:03,704
Went off a few minutes.

256
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,310
Get the light, Dwayne.

257
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,511
It's the blue one, down the street.

258
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,810
Same one as last time.

259
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,930
I think we're ok.

260
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,330
That noise...

261
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,140
Will it bring more of them?

262
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,306
Nothing to do about it now.

263
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,300
Just have to wait 'em out till morning.

264
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:45,350
She's here.

265
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:48,554
Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

266
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,130
I said go! Come on!

267
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:02,085
Come on, quiet.

268
00:35:02,656 --> 00:35:05,193
Shh, shh...

269
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:27,520
It's ok, here. Cry into the pillow.

270
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,858
Can you remember?

271
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:30,815
Shh...

272
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,270
She, uh...

273
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:15,923
She died in the other room, on that bed...

274
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,370
Nothin' I can do about it here...

275
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,330
That fever, man...

276
00:36:24,898 --> 00:36:27,143
Her skin gave off heat like a furnace...

277
00:36:34,437 --> 00:36:38,082
Should have put her down, I should
have put her down, I know that, but...

278
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:41,368
You know what...

279
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:43,205
I just didn't have it in me...

280
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:49,931
She's the mother of my child.

281
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,111
- You sure?
- They're dead.

282
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:21,234
They have to ask, at least one more time.

283
00:37:21,726 --> 00:37:25,309
They're dead.
Except for something in the brain.

284
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,475
That's why it's gotta be the head.

285
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,640
You alright?

286
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,780
Need a moment?

287
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,910
They're alive.

288
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,590
My wife and son.

289
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,590
At least they were when they left.

290
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,080
How can you know?

291
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,317
- By the look of this place...
- I found empty drawers in the bedroom.

292
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,600
They packed some clothes. Not a lot.

293
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:17,080
But enough to travel.

294
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,565
You know anybody could've broken in here
and stolen clothes, right?

295
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:23,300
You see the framed photos on the walls?

296
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,137
Neither do I. Some random thief
took those too, you think?

297
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,268
My photo albums, family pictures, all gone.

298
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,201
Photo albums...

299
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,320
My wife...

300
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,560
Same thing...

301
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,862
Here I am, packing survival gear,
she's grabbing photo albums....

302
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,320
They're in Atlanta, I'll bet.

303
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,480
That's right.

304
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,288
- Why there?
- Refugee settle.

305
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,686
Huge, when they said it,
before the broadcast stopped.

306
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,196
Military protection, food, shelter...

307
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,300
They told people to go there.

308
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:15,060
Said to be safest.

309
00:39:15,448 --> 00:39:17,186
Plus they got that disease place.

310
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,034
Center for Disease Control.

311
00:39:19,364 --> 00:39:22,180
Said they were working on
how to solve this thing.

312
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:52,323
Gas and light have been down
for maybe a month.

313
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,822
Station got its own propane system.

314
00:39:57,699 --> 00:39:59,050
Pilot's still on.

315
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,036
Oh, my Lord.

316
00:40:04,156 --> 00:40:05,926
Hot water!

317
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,209
- Whoo!
- That feels good, right?

318
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,060
Dwayne...

319
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:22,971
Dress in room back there.

320
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,306
What you say, Dwayne?

321
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:27,210
Thank you.

322
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,650
Mhm.

323
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,701
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

324
00:40:35,792 --> 00:40:37,467
Safer anyway. People...

325
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,230
That's where we were heading.

326
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:44,016
Things got crazy. Man, you won't believe.

327
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:45,031
The panic...

328
00:40:45,091 --> 00:40:47,701
Streets won't fit to be on,
and then we'll...

329
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,930
My wife...

330
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,635
couldn't travel. no, not with our herd,

331
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,398
so we had to find a place to lay low.

332
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,736
And then, after she died...

333
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,410
We just stayed hunkered down.

334
00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:07,179
I guess we just froze in place.

335
00:41:09,117 --> 00:41:10,360
Plan to move on?

336
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,035
Haven't worked up to it yet. (*)

337
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,172
A lot of it's gone missing.

338
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,105
Dad, can I learn to shoot?

339
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,691
I'm old enough.

340
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:32,162
Hell yes you're going to learn.

341
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,643
We gotta do it carefully, teach you
to respect the weapon.

342
00:41:34,763 --> 00:41:36,570
That's right. It's not a toy.

343
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,158
You pull the trigger, you have to mean it.
Always remember that, Dwayne.

344
00:41:40,278 --> 00:41:41,211
Yes, sir.

345
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:44,647
Here.

346
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:47,298
Go on.

347
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:54,015
Take that one.

348
00:41:54,135 --> 00:41:55,342
Nothing fancy.

349
00:41:55,817 --> 00:41:57,260
Scope's accurate.

350
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:15,175
Conserve your ammo. Goes faster than
you think. Especially at target practice.

351
00:42:16,709 --> 00:42:17,590
Dwayne.

352
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:19,657
- Yeah?
- Take this to the car.

353
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,710
You sure you won't come along?

354
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:24,900
A few more days...

355
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,272
By the end, Dwayne will know how
to shoot and I won't be so rusty.

356
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:37,091
You got one better.

357
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:40,427
I'll turn mine on, a few minutes
every day at dawn.

358
00:42:40,547 --> 00:42:43,002
You get up there, that's how you find me.

359
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,990
- You think they're here?
- Can't afford not to.

360
00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,018
- Not anymore.
- Look, just one thing.

361
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,418
They may not seem
like much one at a time...

362
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,837
but in a group all round up and hungry...

363
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,870
- They you watch your ass.
- You too.

364
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:00,480
You a good man, Rick.

365
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,601
I hope you find your wife and son.

366
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,690
Be seeing you, Dwayne.

367
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,701
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes, sir.

368
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:22,652
Leon Bessi?

369
00:43:26,774 --> 00:43:28,140
Didn't think much of him.

370
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,183
Careless and dumb, but...

371
00:43:31,084 --> 00:43:33,230
can't leave him like this.

372
00:43:37,053 --> 00:43:38,370
You know, if they hear the shot..?

373
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:41,658
- Let's not be here when they show up.
- Let's go, son.

374
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,010
Come on.

375
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,160
Read your comic books a while.

376
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,011
Daddy'll be upstairs.

377
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,438
- Daddy?
- It's alright, Dwayne.

378
00:47:24,984 --> 00:47:27,249
You stay there, son.
Don't come up here.

379
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:58,041
Come on, baby.

380
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:31,755
I'm sorry this happened to you.

381
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,834
Come on, come on.

382
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,267
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

383
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:26,981
We'll be approaching Atlanta on Highway 85.

384
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,193
Anybody reads, please respond.

385
00:50:32,223 --> 00:50:34,260
Hello. Hello.

386
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,020
Can anybody hear my voice?

387
00:50:38,808 --> 00:50:42,309
Anybody out there?
Anybody hears me, please respond.

388
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,242
Hello, can you hear my voice?

389
00:50:46,648 --> 00:50:49,440
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear my voice?

390
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,052
Hey? Hello?

391
00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:54,195
- Can you hear my voice?
- Yes, I can hear you.

392
00:50:54,315 --> 00:50:55,553
You're coming through. Over.

393
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,397
Anybody who reads, please respond.

394
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,638
Broadcasting on emergency channel.

395
00:51:00,904 --> 00:51:03,999
We'll be approaching Atlanta
on Highway 85.

396
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:06,160
Anybody reads, please respond.

397
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,017
We're just outside the city.

398
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:12,850
Damnit.

399
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,480
Hello?

400
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,000
Hello?

401
00:51:16,633 --> 00:51:18,076
He couldn't hear me. I couldn't warn him.

402
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,120
Try to raise him again.

403
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:21,535
Come on, son. You know best
how to work this thing,

404
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,008
Hello, hello, is the person
who calls still on the air?

405
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:34,144
This is officer Shane Walsh, broadcasting
a person unknown, please respond.

406
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:41,824
He's gone.

407
00:51:44,122 --> 00:51:46,230
There are others. It's not just us.

408
00:51:46,535 --> 00:51:48,894
Yeah, We knew there would be, right,
that's why we let the CB on.

409
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:51,150
Lot of good it's been doing.

410
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,359
And I've been saying for a week,
we ought to put signs up on 85

411
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,852
to warn people away from the city.

412
00:51:56,274 --> 00:51:58,253
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

413
00:51:58,735 --> 00:52:00,206
We don't have enough time.

414
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:03,275
I think we need to make time.

415
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,201
Yeah, that, uh...

416
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,307
That's a luxury we can't afford.

417
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:10,148
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

418
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,164
And who the hell would you propose to send?

419
00:52:13,284 --> 00:52:15,104
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

420
00:52:15,224 --> 00:52:17,197
Nobody goes anywhere alone, you know that.

421
00:52:22,397 --> 00:52:23,810
Yes, sir.

422
00:52:24,348 --> 00:52:27,747
Hey, hey, hey, come on, take a sit, buddy.
You're alright, go on, you're alright.

423
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,340
What, you're pissed at me?

424
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:38,440
Well pissing me all you want
won't gonna change anything.

425
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:43,822
I'm not putting you in danger, okay?
I'm not doing it for anything.

426
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,743
I make you feel like sometimes you wanna
slap me outside the head...

427
00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:50,471
I'll tell you what, girl. You feel that need,
you go right ahead. I'm right here.

428
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:56,286
You cannot walk off like that,

429
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:58,354
all half-cocked.

430
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,612
Look, if you don't wanna do it for
my sake or for your sake, that's fine.

431
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:02,551
But just...

432
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:04,560
You do it for him.

433
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:07,744
That boy has been through too much.

434
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:10,629
And he's not losing his mother too, ok?

435
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:12,690
Okay.

436
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,107
Ok, fine.

437
00:53:18,994 --> 00:53:20,110
You tell me okay.

438
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,610
It's not hard.

439
00:53:32,507 --> 00:53:33,471
Hey...

440
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:49,451
Mom?

441
00:53:53,269 --> 00:53:55,071
What's up, buddy? She's in there, go on.

442
00:53:56,961 --> 00:53:57,963
Hey.

443
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:01,071
I don't want you to worry.
Your mom is not going anywhere.

444
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:02,136
Okay?

445
00:54:02,923 --> 00:54:06,336
- Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Go finish your chores.
- Okay.

446
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,490
Hello?

447
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,354
Police officer out here.

448
00:54:58,105 --> 00:54:59,412
Can I borrow some gas?

449
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,700
Hello?

450
00:55:15,629 --> 00:55:16,580
Hello?

451
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:18,840
Anybody home?

452
00:57:05,738 --> 00:57:07,196
Easy now, easy.

453
00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:08,810
I'm not gonna hurt you.

454
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:10,960
Nothing like that.

455
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,929
More like a proposal.

456
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,390
Atlanta's just down the road ways.

457
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,573
It's safe there.

458
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:24,343
Food, shelter, people,
other horses too, I bet.

459
00:57:26,222 --> 00:57:27,490
How's that sound?

460
00:57:28,936 --> 00:57:30,674
There we go. Good boy.

461
00:57:32,885 --> 00:57:36,775
Good boy. Now come with me.
Come with me.

462
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,260
Let's go easy, ok?
I haven't done this for years.

463
00:57:57,506 --> 00:58:03,056
Easy. Easy, boy. Easy, easy, easy.

464
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,776
Let's go.

465
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:18,840
Steady. It's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

466
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,810
Okay, whoa whoa whoa.

467
01:03:10,026 --> 01:03:12,690
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

468
01:05:37,116 --> 01:05:38,379
Hey, you.

469
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,670
Dumb ass.

470
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,450
Hey, you in the tank.

471
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:47,371
Cozy in there?

472
