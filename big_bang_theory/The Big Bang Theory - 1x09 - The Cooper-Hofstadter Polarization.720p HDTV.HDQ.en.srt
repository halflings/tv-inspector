1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,279
Ok...

2
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,875
The X10's are online

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:11,220
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a
signal from this laptop through our
local ISP

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,373
racing down fibre optic cable at
the speed of light to San Fransisco,

5
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:18,546
bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to
Lisbon, Portugal,

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,576
where the data packets will be headed
off to submerge transatlantic cables,

7
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,292
terminating in Halifax,
Nova Scotia

8
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:26,697
and transfered across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP

9
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,024
And the extend receiver
attached to this...

10
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:31,860
Lamp.

11
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:36,899
Look at me, look at me.
I've got goosebumps.

12
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,804
- Are we ready for the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

13
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,061
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

14
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,763
It's a little loud.

15
00:01:05,888 --> 00:01:07,790
No problem... Turning it down.

16
00:01:08,436 --> 00:01:12,291
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax...
... et voil?

17
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:17,282
- OK, thanks.
- Hang on, hang on. Do you not
realise what we just did?

18
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:19,671
Yeah, you turned your stereo
down with your laptop.

19
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,561
No, we turned our stereo down, by
sending a signal around the world via
the Internet.

20
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:28,263
Oh. You know you can get one of those
universal remotes from Radioshack?

21
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:29,742
They're really cheap.

22
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,772
No, you don't get it. Howard,

23
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:36,032
- Enable public access.
- Public access enabled.

24
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:43,071
- Boy, that's terrific. I'll see ya.
- No hang on, hang on...

25
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:46,462
See?

26
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:48,731
No.

27
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,431
Someone in Sichuan province,
China, is using his computer

28
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:55,062
to turn our lights on and off.

29
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,043
Oh, that's handy.

30
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:01,392
Here's a question... Why?

31
00:02:03,098 --> 00:02:04,963
Because we can.

32
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,653
They found our
remote control cars!

33
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,471
- Wait, what's on top of that?
- Wireless webcams, wave hello!

34
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:18,203
The monster truck is
out of Austin, Texas,

35
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,893
and the blue Viper is being
operated from suburban Tel Aviv.

36
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,071
- You may want to put on slacks.
- What?

37
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,982
Ew, stop it! No!
Leave me alone!

38
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:39,150
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

39
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,600
Season 1 Episode 9:
The Cooper-Hofstadter Polarization

1
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,500
You know in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars,

2
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
we're going to look at this
as eight hours well wasted.

3
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,600
I don't want to be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

4
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,700
Eight feet tall and ribbed.

5
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,100
I'm with you.

6
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I just have to make sure if I'm a
synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.

7
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,900
I promised my mother.

8
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,700
I suppose you could have your
android penis circumcised.

9
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,900
But that's something your rabbi would
have to discuss with the manufacturer.

10
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
Not to mention you'd have
to power down on saturdays.

11
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Sheldon, why is this
letter in the trash?

12
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,300
Well, there's always
the possibility that

13
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,300
a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter

14
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,700
but Occam's rasor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

15
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,900
It's from the Institute of
Experimental Physics, they want us to

16
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,200
present our paper on the
properties of supersolids

17
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
at the topical conference of
Bose-Einstein condensates.

18
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,400
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.

19
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,300
Ok, if I may drill down to
the bedrock of my question:

20
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,800
why did you throw it out?

21
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,600
Because I have no interest in standing
in the Rose room of the
Pasadena Marriot,

22
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,900
in front of a group of
judgmental strangers

23
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,500
who wouldn't recognise true genius if it
was standing in front of them giving
a speech.

24
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Which if I were there,
would be.

25
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,500
I don't know Sheldon.

26
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,900
Those topical conferences on
Bose-Einstein condensates' parties
are legendary

27
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,100
- Forget the parties!
- Forget the parties? What a nerd.

28
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Are there any other honours I've
got that I don't know about?

29
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,700
Did the UPS dropped off a
Nobel prize with my name on it?

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,100
Leonard, please don't take this the
wrong way, but the day you win a
Nobel prize,

31
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,200
is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassles on
flying carpets.

32
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
The only thing missing from
that insult was: "your mama".

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I got one... Hey Leonard,

34
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,200
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...
- Shut up, Howard.

35
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,900
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

36
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,300
We have to take a nourishment,
to expel waste,

37
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,900
and inhale enough oxygen to
keep our cells from dying.

38
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,400
Everything else is optional.

39
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Ok, let me put it this way:
I'm doing it.

40
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
You can't. I'm the lead author.

41
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,700
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we
went alphabetically.

42
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,200
I let you think we went
alphabetically to spare you

43
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,700
the humiliation with dealing with
the fact that it was my idea.

44
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,800
Now to put too fine a point to it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

45
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
You're welcome.

46
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

47
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,500
That doesn't mean proving.

48
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,200
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to take your word?

49
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

50
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,900
Alright, I don't
care what you say.

51
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,300
I'm going to the conference
and I'm presenting our findings

52
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,200
And I forbid it.

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,200
You forbid it?

54
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,800
If I'm not taking credit
for our work then nobody is.

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,100
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.

56
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,300
Once again,
I'm throwing you a bone.

57
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
And once again,
you are welcome.

58
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,000
So, how's it going with Sheldon? Are you
guys still not talking to each other?

59
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,700
Not only is he still
not talking to me,

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,500
but there's this thing he does where he
stares at you and tries to get your
brain to explode.

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,600
You know, like in the classic
sci-fi movie "Scanners"?

62
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,800
Like... . Bzzz.

63
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,800
Nevermind.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,500
How about this one?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,600
It says, I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy.

66
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,400
Oh, I didn't know they
still made corduroy suits.

67
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,700
They don't,
that's why I saved this one.

68
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,600
Ok, well,
let's just see what else you have.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,900
Ok, here. Take this.

70
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,000
And this, and this,
and this, and these...

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,700
Is this all stuff you
want me to try on?

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
No, this is stuff I
want you to throw out.

73
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,300
Seriously, don't even give it to
charity, you won't be helping anyone.

74
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,700
What's this?

75
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,600
That's the bottled
city of Kandor.

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,400
You see, Kandor was the capital
city of the planet Krypton.

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,300
It was miniaturised by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded

78
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,200
and then rescued by Superman.

79
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Oh, nice.

80
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,200
It's a lot cooler when
girls aren't looking at it.

81
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Here, why don't you put these while
I find a shirt and a sport cut match.

82
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Right, be right back.

83
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,200
Where are you going?
Just put them on.

84
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,200
Here?

85
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
Oh, are you shy?

86
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,700
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,100
There's nothing to see...
Well, not 'nothing'...

89
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,600
Sweetie, put the pants on.

90
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,000
So, you know, isn't there maybe
some way you and Sheldon could

91
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,500
- compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.

92
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,300
Scientists do not compromise.

93
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
Our minds are trained
to synthetize facts

94
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,400
and come to
inarguable conclusions.

95
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Not to mention,
Sheldon is back-crap crazy.

96
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,200
What is this?

97
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,300
Oh, careful.

98
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,300
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

99
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, why didn't you
wear it on Halloween?

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Because it's not a costume,
it's a flight suit.

101
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,800
Ok, alright, moving on.

102
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,100
Oh, wow. A paisley shirt.

103
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,800
It goes with my corduroy suit.

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,100
If you mean it should end up in
the same place, then I agree.

105
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,600
Is this your only tie?

106
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,500
Technically, yes.
But, if you'll notice...

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
It's reversible!

108
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,100
So it works as two.

109
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Sweetie, I don't even
think it works as one.

110
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,500
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.

111
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,400
Everything since
the eighth grade.

112
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout

113
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
Ok, well,
let's go back to the curdoroy suit.

114
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
- Great.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,100
I said no. Put it down.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hey Sheldon.

117
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello Penny.

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Get anything good?

119
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,100
Just the latest copy of Applied
Particle Physics quarterly.

120
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,400
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

121
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,700
It was a joke.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,900
Yep.

123
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.

124
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,700
Penny, just to save you
from further awkwardness,

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,200
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs
in silence.

126
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, yeah ok, me too.
Zip it, lock it.

127
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,900
Put it in your pocket.

128
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,800
- So, you and Leonard...
- Oh dear God...

129
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,100
Little misunderstanding, huh?

130
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,000
A little misunderstanding... ?

131
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,400
Galileo and the Pope had
a little misunderstanding.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this
morning and I think he feels really bad
about it.

133
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,600
How do you feel?

134
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,400
I don't understand
the question.

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
I'm just asking if it's difficult to
be fighting with your best friend.

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,400
I haven't thought
about it like that.

137
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,600
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations

138
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,300
of some sort of unconscious
emotional turmoil

139
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Wait, what?

140
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,700
I couldn't poop this morning.

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,100
You should just talk to him,
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

142
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,300
- Certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

143
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
A powerful laxative.

144
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,500
You absolutely
should talk to him.

145
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,300
Look, I know Leonard values you as
a friend and he told me himself

146
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,800
without your little idea there's no way
he could come up with this whole
experiment thing.

147
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,800
Excuse me. "Little idea"?

148
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
Yeah, I mean he tried
to explain it to me,

149
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,700
- I didn't really understand it but...
- Of course you didn't.

150
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,300
He said: "Little idea"?

151
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,500
Oh, well, no... Not...

152
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,000
- Not in those words.
- In what words then, exactly?

153
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Oh, you know... Gee. The exact words
are... It's more the spirit in which
he said...

154
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
- What did he say?
- You had a lucky hunch

155
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,100
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking,
instead of arguing about this...

156
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Don't you ever
speak to me again.

157
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,700
What... ?

158
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,900
Ok, I'm leaving
for the conference.

159
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
Have fun presenting
my "lucky hunch"

160
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,400
Shel, I didn't
mean it like that.

161
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,300
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't...

162
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,100
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all. A little bit.

163
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
How did that work out for you?

164
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,900
- Leonard, ready to go?
- Libido: 1 Truth: 0.

165
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,100
Ok, I'm gonna ask
you one more time.

166
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,700
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

167
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,600
And I'm telling you
for the last time,

168
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,600
it's pandering,
it's undignifying, and bite me.

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's go.

170
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,100
- Bye Sheldon.
- Goodbye Penny.

171
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,900
One of these days... bshh!

172
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
There you go.

173
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,300
You're right this side
does look better.

174
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,200
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said "less stained".

175
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,200
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20-25 people in there.

176
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
- You're kidding!
- Is that all?

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,400
"All? " In particle
physics 25 is Woodstock!

178
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,800
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd,

179
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
I'm all nervous.

180
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
It's ok, just open with a joke,
you'll be fine.

181
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
A joke... Ok.

182
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
How about this? Um, ok...

183
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,900
There's this farmer

184
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,900
and he has these chickens but
they won't lay any eggs, so...

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
He calls a physicist to help.

186
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,000
The physicist then does
some calculations,

187
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,600
and he says:
"I have a solution,

188
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,200
but it only works for spherical
chickens in a vacuum".

189
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Right?

190
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,700
Oh, sorry,
I just had heard it before.

191
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
- Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

192
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
I really should have
brought my own car.

1
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,900
So, in conclusion,

2
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
the data show that at temperatures
approaching absolute zero,

3
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,400
the moment of inertia changes,
and a solid becomes a supersolid,

4
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,600
which clearly appears to be a
previously unknown state of matter.

5
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,600
Thank you!

6
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,800
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

7
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
What the hell was that?

8
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,500
Any other questions?

9
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,600
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the
lead author of this particular paper.

10
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,400
Thank you.

11
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,800
And you sir, you have completely skipped
over the part where I was walking
through the park

12
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,200
and I saw these children on a
merry-go-round which started me thinking

13
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,100
about the moment of inertia
in gases like helium

14
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

15
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,100
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote, it's not science.

16
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Oh, I see. It was the apple
falling on Newton's head,

17
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,900
- was that just an anecdote?
- You are not Isaac Newton.

18
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,300
No, no, that's true. Gravity would have
been apparent to me without the apple.

19
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,800
You cannot possibly
be that arrogant.

20
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,300
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

21
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,700
Look, if you weren't happy with my
presentation then maybe you should have
given it with me!

22
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,800
As I have explained repeatedly,
unlike you,

23
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
I don't need validation
from lesser minds.

24
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,100
No offense.

25
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,900
Really, so why did you come?

26
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,300
Because I knew
you'd screw this up.

27
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,700
I didn't screw it up!

28
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,100
Oh, please.
I admit that spherical chicken joke,

29
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
- that was hilarious.
- Thank you.

30
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,100
But it was straight
downhill from there.

31
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,400
I've had enough of
your condescendship.

32
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,400
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11 like you.

33
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,900
Maybe I got my doctorate
at 24 instead of 16

34
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
but you are not the only
person who is smarter than

35
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,100
everyone else in this room!

36
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,000
No offense.

37
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,900
And I am clearly
not the only person

38
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,700
who is tormented by insecurity

39
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
and has an ego in need
of constant validation!

40
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
So you admit you're an egotist?

41
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,500
Yes!

42
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,900
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter
and I can never please my parents so

43
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,300
I need all my self esteem
from strangers like you!

44
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
But he's worse!

45
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Ok, that's it!

46
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,300
Stop it!

47
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
You cannot blow up my
head with your mind!

48
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,500
Then I'll settle
for your aneurism!

49
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,700
- Stop it!
- You hit me!

50
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,900
You saw that he hit me!

51
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,600
You tried to blow up my head!

52
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,500
So it was working!

53
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
It wa... It was not!
You're a nutcase!

54
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
We'll see about that!

55
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,300
Heads up,
you people in the front row!

56
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,600
This is a splash zone!

57
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,400
Stop it!

58
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,400
Just quit it!

59
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,800
Is this usually how
these physics things go?

60
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,500
More often than you think.

61
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,900
You could have offered
me a ride home.

62
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,500
You're lucky I
didn't run you over.

63
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,500
I really don't understand
what you're so unhappy about.

64
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,200
You begged me to come, I came.

65
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,400
There's just no pleasing you.

66
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,000
You're right, I'm the problem,
I'm the one that needs help.

67
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,600
Well, that's not much of an
apology but I'll take it.

68
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,000
Excuse me,

69
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,800
is there anything you
would apologise for?

70
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,100
Yes.

71
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm sorry I tried to
blow up your head.

72
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,400
It was uncalled for.

73
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
You won't believe this.

74
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,800
Somebody got the whole thing with
their cell phone and put it on YouTube!

75
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,500
What?

76
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,500
- Who would do that?
- That would be me.

77
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,000
Hey, check it out,
it's a featured video!

78
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,000
He hit me!
You saw that he hit me!

79
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,100
- Then it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!

80
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
We will see about that!

81
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,400
You people in the
front row heads up!

82
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,700
This is splash zone

83
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,900
Stop it! Leave it, leave it!

84
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,900
You want a volcano nerve pinch!

85
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
You should clip your fingernails!
Those hurt!

86
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,700
Oh, Jeez.
does this suit really look that bad?

87
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,700
Forget your suit,
look at my arms waving.

88
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,300
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

89
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,100
Howard,

90
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,800
would you like to explain to
me why your Facebook page

91
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,100
has a picture of me sleeping
on your shoulder captioned

92
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,500
"me and my girlfriend"?

93
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Uh oh, here comes the talk.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
