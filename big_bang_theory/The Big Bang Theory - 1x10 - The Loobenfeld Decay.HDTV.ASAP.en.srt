1
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:03,671
It's amazing people keep coming

2
00:00:03,864 --> 00:00:04,965
to comic book stores

3
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:08,449
instead of just downloading
comics digitally.

4
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:10,002
It's probably for the best.

5
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:12,088
For a lot of these guys,
the weekly trip here

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,135
is the only chance
their mom has to go down

7
00:00:14,137 --> 00:00:15,928
to the basement
and change their sheets.

8
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,720
Oh, that reminds me,
I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

9
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:24,578
Well?

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,512
What do you think
of New Comic Book Night?

11
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:28,938
Magic, huh?

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,802
Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

13
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:32,092
As a brilliant man,

14
00:00:32,094 --> 00:00:33,282
you're entitled to a vice.

15
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,961
I could understand
frequenting an opium den

16
00:00:34,963 --> 00:00:37,115
or hunting your fellow man
for sport.

17
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:41,602
But this? Lame-o.

18
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:44,760
Well, A) Comic books
employ storytelling

19
00:00:44,762 --> 00:00:46,294
through sequential art,

20
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,332
an medium that dates back
17,000 years

21
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:50,298
to the cave paintings
of Lascaux,

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,602
and B) You play the harp.

23
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:53,945
Like that's cool.

24
00:00:57,402 --> 00:00:59,511
Can I help you find anything?

25
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:01,805
A comic that depicts
a woman whose bosom

26
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:03,808
can't be used
as a flotation device.

27
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:06,349
Sorry. Most of the guys

28
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,538
who come in here
like big boobs.

29
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,599
Couple of them have big boobs.

30
00:01:12,137 --> 00:01:13,433
Hey, look, the new

31
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,521
Warlords of Ka'a
expansion pack is out.

32
00:01:15,523 --> 00:01:17,630
A new one?
Unbelievable.

33
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:19,958
They just keep making up
more cheesy monsters,

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,384
slapping them on cards and
selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

35
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:26,731
It's like a secret tax
on guys who can't get laid.

36
00:01:27,924 --> 00:01:29,191
They're not even trying.

37
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:31,275
Remember the Satanimals pack
with the Hellephant?

38
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:32,567
Why, absurd.

39
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,033
What was he, a bad elephant
who died and went to hell?

40
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,439
What could an elephant

41
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:39,859
possibly do that would cause him
eternal damnation?

42
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:41,501
"Wild West and Witches"?

43
00:01:41,503 --> 00:01:44,823
What kind of loser cares
about a showdown

44
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:48,603
between Billy the Kid and
the White Wizard of the North?

45
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,143
A total loser.

46
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,183
Obviously,
a guy with a six-shooter

47
00:01:52,185 --> 00:01:53,976
beats an old man
with a magic wand.

48
00:01:55,685 --> 00:01:57,301
Well, h-hold on.

49
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,399
Uh, what if the wizard casts

50
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:03,585
a Helmet of Confusion spell
on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

51
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,046
What? Please!

52
00:02:05,048 --> 00:02:06,699
This is Billy the Kid
we're talking about.

53
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:08,848
I mean, the wizard
would get shot between the eyes

54
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,206
before he could ever
get out the words,

55
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:11,904
"What the hell
is Billy the Kid doing

56
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:14,238
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,213
Leonard...

58
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:19,224
What's the deal
with Sheldon's friend Amy?

59
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,293
Are they a couple?

60
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,741
Couple of weirdos. Why?

61
00:02:22,743 --> 00:02:24,621
You interested in Amy?

62
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,267
Well, I mean,
she didn't look through me

63
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:29,102
with soul-sucking,
ball-shriveling

64
00:02:29,104 --> 00:02:31,691
hatred and contempt.

65
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,553
I like that in a woman.

66
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,057
Could you run it by Sheldon
if I could ask her out?

67
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:38,575
Sure. I guess.

68
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:40,228
Stuart, settle an
argument for us.

69
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,776
Who would win,

70
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,131
Billy the Kid
or the White Wizard?

71
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,086
If I tell you that,

72
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:49,291
I'm robbing you of the hours
of fun you could have

73
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:54,379
for the magical, rootin'-tootin'
low price of $24.95.

74
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:57,117
I'll take one.

75
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,591
Mm... make it two.

76
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:01,201
I hate all of you and myself.
Three.

77
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,436
I'll ring it up.

78
00:03:04,438 --> 00:03:06,958
Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

79
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:28,442
The Big Bang Theory S05E10
"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition"

80
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:33,294
By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es
==SPREAD THE WORD==

81
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:37,005
Hey, can I talk to
you about something?

82
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:39,113
It's a little awkward.

83
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,964
I know what this is about.

84
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:44,464
Given the professional
standstill you're at,

85
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,269
you're wondering
if this is the appropriate time

86
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:50,387
to abandon your research
and focus on teaching.

87
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,321
Yes.

88
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,876
And if I may suggest,

89
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,553
consider changing disciplines.

90
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:02,830
Yeah, to the humanities...
perhaps history.

91
00:04:02,832 --> 00:04:05,226
One of the advantages
of teaching history

92
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,953
is that you don't have
to create things.

93
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:10,082
You know, you just
have to remember

94
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:12,744
stuff that happened
and then parrot it back.

95
00:04:12,746 --> 00:04:15,285
You could have fun with that.

96
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,158
Yeah, that's not it.

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,618
Stuart's kind of
interested in Amy.

98
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,955
Oh, of course he is.
She's very interesting.

99
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:25,128
Did you know, when she was 14,

100
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,849
she severed the webbing
between her own toes?

101
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:31,943
No.

102
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,765
He wanted me to find out

103
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:37,082
if you'd have a problem
with him asking her out.

104
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,023
I'm not sure how to respond,
Leonard.

105
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,289
I don't own Amy.

106
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,783
Can't own a person.

107
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,614
At least not since...

108
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:55,749
1863.

109
00:04:57,614 --> 00:05:00,109
President Lincoln freed the...

110
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,165
Slaves!
Come on, Leonard,

111
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,507
if you're going
to teach history,

112
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,944
these are the kind of facts
you'll have to know.

113
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:09,490
You know what?
Never mind.

114
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:12,056
I'm going to tell him
it's okay to ask her out.

115
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:13,329
The question is moot.

116
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,178
There is no way that Stuart,

117
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,338
an impoverished peddler
of picture books,

118
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,971
would be at all appealing
to Amy Farrah Fowler,

119
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,177
a noted neurobiologist

120
00:05:22,179 --> 00:05:24,916
capable of performing surgery
on her own feet

121
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:26,641
with nothing but nitrous oxide

122
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:29,175
from cans of whipped cream
as anesthesia.

123
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,404
All right, but for the record,

124
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:35,324
I checked in with you
to see how you'd feel about it.

125
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,834
Fine.
The record shall so reflect.

126
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,489
Now, getting back
to the problem at hand,

127
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:43,826
what to do with a washed-up
experimental physicist...

128
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,811
I am not washed-up.

129
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:49,930
Oh, Leonard.

130
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,299
Lots of people love you
and want to help you,

131
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,297
but they can't
until you admit the problem.

132
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:01,989
Well, ladies,
we killed the bottle.

133
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,184
I had half a glass.

134
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,863
I didn't have any.

135
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,704
Okay, don't judge me.

136
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,818
So, what do you want to do...

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,028
go to the movies, go dancing,
lay down for a little bit?

138
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:18,363
Or we play... Travel Twister.

139
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,800
Amy, really? Twister?

140
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,328
Excuse me.
I've passed many

141
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,797
an enjoyable evening
playing this game.

142
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,553
And I'm sure it's
a lot more exciting

143
00:06:26,555 --> 00:06:28,627
when you play with other people.

144
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:32,451
What do you say, bestie?
We can do shirts and skins.

145
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:33,876
I'm shirts. Called it.

146
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,913
I'm too small for Twister.

147
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,360
And roller coasters.

148
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:42,815
And sitting with my
feet on the floor.

149
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:47,355
Hope you enjoyed the
prenatal cigarettes, Mom.

150
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,829
Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot

151
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,578
when she was pregnant with me,
and I turned out just fine.

152
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,914
Hey, look, I have
peach schnapps.

153
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,519
Thank God.

154
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:00,286
Guys, something happened.

155
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:01,409
What's wrong?

156
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:03,561
I think a boy likes me.

157
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,589
"Hi. It's Stuart.

158
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,609
"We met at the
comic book store.

159

00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,626
to start taking Zoloft."

164
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,010
Amy, little vixen.

165
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:23,179
Just working it under all those
layers of wool and polyester.

166
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,236
What are you going to do?

167
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,790
Doesn't he know
you have a boyfriend?

168
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,368
Oh, she doesn't
have a boyfriend;

169
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,180
she has a Sheldon.

170
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:33,329
So do you like Stuart?

171
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,746
I don't know.

172
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:36,013
He's nice.

173
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:37,214
He's funny.

174
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:38,806
He has the sallow,
drawn countenance

175
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,730
associated with an overactive
thyroid gland.

176
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:42,406
That's kind of hot.

177
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,377
Okay, look, sweetie,
we all love Sheldon,

178
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,370
but you've been with him
over a year now.

179
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,502
If it's not going anywhere,

180
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:49,835
what does it hurt
to look around?

181
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,752
Well, yeah, I guess
they're not engaged

182
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,439
like me and Howie.

183
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,590
Yeah, for what it's worth,

184
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,859
engaged people
can look around, too.

185
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,016
Lot of options out there.

186
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,280
Where's Stuart?

187
00:08:09,534 --> 00:08:10,965
Out.

188
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,775
Who are you?

189
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:14,970
I'm Dale.

190
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,972
He left me in charge.

191
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,477
Really?

192
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,790
Yeah.

193
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,767
I don't get it, either.

194
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:29,406
I want to return
this "Wild West and Witches"

195
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,246
Ka'a expansion pack.

196
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:33,019
Sorry. I don't do returns.

197
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,986
They're hard.

198
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:37,790
Sure, sure.

199
00:08:38,957 --> 00:08:40,655
Uh, when will Stuart be back?

200
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,423
I don't know.
He went out for coffee.

201
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:43,797
With a girl.

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,638
Oh, I guess I was wrong.

203
00:08:49,688 --> 00:08:51,015
You okay?

204
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,566
Am I okay?

205
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:55,844
Leonard,
I'm on a lifelong trajectory

206
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:58,835
that includes a Nobel Prize
and cities named after me,

207
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,386
all four wisdom teeth

208
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:02,604
fit comfortably in my mouth
without need of extraction,

209
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:05,859
and my bowel movements run
like a German train schedule.

210
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:10,426
Am I okay?

211
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,895
I'm okay, too!

212
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:24,543
Wild Bill Witchcock.

213
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,329
A tribe of Abra-Comanches.

214
00:09:35,443 --> 00:09:37,576
Flaming Spittoon.

215
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,434
And for the record,

216
00:09:38,456 --> 00:09:40,943
I'm very disappointed
in you cowpokes.

217
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:42,840
We're playing
our inaugural round

218
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,100
of "Wild West and Witches,"

219
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,258
and I'm the only one
who bothered

220
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,110
to dress for the occasion.

221
00:09:48,112 --> 00:09:49,789
Patooie.

222
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,108
We're not wearing
cowboy hats, Sheldon.

223
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,799
It looks ridiculous.

224
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:59,159
And I suppose my boots and spurs
are ridiculous, too?

225
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:01,526
- Very.
- Incredibly so.

226
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:05,160
Did it look ridiculous
when we got the Satanimals pack

227
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:08,964
and I dressed up
as a Beelzebobcat?

228
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:10,590
- Very.
- Incredibly so.

229
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,153
All right, fine.
Let's just play.

230
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,841
We should go easy on him.

231
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:17,584
Amy's out with Stuart tonight.

232
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:18,979
Wait a minute.

233
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:21,977
Are you telling me
that Sheldon's patented blend

234
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,110
of condescension and no sex

235
00:10:24,112 --> 00:10:26,415
isn't enough
to hold on to a woman?

236
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,648
Cluck, cluck, cluck.

237
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,015
What are we,
ladies at a quilting bee?

238
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,933
Or are we men
playing a fantasy card game

239
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,528
set in a magical frontier town?

240
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,884
Sorry.

241
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:44,327
Creepy Tepee.

242
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,882
Annie Ogly.

243
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,328
Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.

244
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,085
And may I point out
it is the three of you

245
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,540
who are obsessed with
Stuart and Amy, not me.

246
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:00,123
I think you need
to ask yourselves

247
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,006
who's really being
ridiculous here.

248
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,523
- It's you. - You are.
- Totally you.

249
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,548
Hey, guys, check it out.

250
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,555
The deluxe limited edition
"Wild West and Witches"

251
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:22,120
expansion pack in the signed
and numbered collector's tin.

252
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:23,620
Come on, no!

253
00:11:23,622 --> 00:11:26,154
We just bought the regular pack.

254
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:27,457
Ooh, a sheriff's badge.

255
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,043
Yeah, it's also a wand.

256
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:36,235
With a hologram? Nice!

257
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,378
Hey, do you see this?

258
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,122
I'm in the matrix, Leonard;
I see everything.

259
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:41,912
You got to be kidding me.

260
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:44,108
You friended Stuart
on Facebook?

261
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,982
I thought you didn't
like Facebook anymore.

262
00:11:45,984 --> 00:11:47,376
Don't be silly.

263
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:50,681
I'm a fan of anything that tries
to replace actual human contact.

264
00:11:50,683 --> 00:11:53,120
Please.

265
00:11:53,122 --> 00:11:55,670
You're looking at Facebook
to find out how their date went.

266
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:56,508
Really?

267
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:58,411
You think I care if a man, what,

268
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:02,259
"shared a pumpkin latte
with a dynamite lady"?

269
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,286
You're so full of it.

270
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:04,772
You are free to believe

271
00:12:04,774 --> 00:12:06,980
whatever you like.

272
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:10,243
And unfriend
Rajesh Koothrappali.

273
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,775
You unfriended me? Seriously?

274
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,135
Oh, yeah.

275
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:15,040
Now he's gonna miss all
those great updates like,

276
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,838
"I can't believe
I waited this long

277
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,688
to make my own potpourri."

278
00:12:20,246 --> 00:12:21,798
Sheldon, why don't you
just acknowledge

279
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,158
that you have feelings for Amy

280
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,450
and you don't want her
going out with other men?

281
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:29,045
And unfriend
Leonard Hofstadter.

282
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:30,186
Here's a radical thought.

283
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,610
Go old-school,
challenge Stuart to a fight.

284
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:34,178
I mean, nothing makes
the ladies hotter

285
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,038
than two skinny white guys

286
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,321
swatting at each other
with their eyes closed.

287
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:42,940
And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.

288
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,016
That's all of us.

289
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,980
Can I use the laptop?
Why?

290
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:50,681
I have to buy that
stupid collector's tin.

291
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:53,963
- Who do we love?
- Penny.

292
00:12:53,965 --> 00:12:55,427
Who do we love?
Penny.

293
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,954
Who do we love?
Penny.

294
00:12:57,956 --> 00:12:59,671
Hello, Sheldon.

295
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:00,959
Come on in.

296
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:02,280
Thank you.

297
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,097
What's up?

298
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,701
I came to ask if you would like
to go on a date with me.

299
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:11,824
I'm sorry, what?

300
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:13,068
A date.

301
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,188
You and me.

302
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,919
Dining, dancing,

303
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,851
perhaps you'd like to
take in a prizefight.

304
00:13:19,895 --> 00:13:22,814
God, are you trying
to make Amy jealous?

305
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,072
No.

306
00:13:24,074 --> 00:13:27,029
Why is everyone so obsessed
with Amy and Stuart?

307
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,365
Whether or not they may be
having more pumpkin lattes

308
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,374
or intercourse tonight.

309
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,026
Okay, listen to me.

310
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:36,843
Playing games is not
gonna help get Amy back.

311
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:39,089
I am not trying to get her back.

312
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:42,385
But, out of curiosity,
what is a way?

313
00:13:42,387 --> 00:13:44,540
All right, honey,
let me tell you a story.

314
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:47,729
There was a guy I liked,
and I never told him how I felt.

315
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:49,838
Eventually, he started
going out with someone else,

316
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,905
and I always regretted it.

317
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,888
Do you see
where I'm going with this?

318
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,689
I believe I do.

319
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:56,910
Mm.

320
00:13:56,912 --> 00:13:58,895
I'm the guy.

321
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,878
You're not the guy.

322
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,689
Are you sure?

323
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,379
That would explain so much.

324
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,127
Your constant presence
in my apartment,

325
00:14:10,129 --> 00:14:12,753
that baffling dalliance
with Leonard just to be near me,

326
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:14,172
the way you call me

327
00:14:14,174 --> 00:14:16,275
"sweetie" all the time.

328
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:17,544
I call everyone "sweetie."

329
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:18,376
You tramp.

330
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,094
Look, Sheldon,
all I'm saying is

331
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:25,266
strap on a pair
and go talk to Amy.

332
00:14:25,268 --> 00:14:27,225
"Strap on a pair"?

333
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,731
Of what, skates?

334
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:34,339
Oh, sweetie,
you are so not the guy.

335
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:43,229
If you're bored, you can go.

336
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,943
I understand.

337
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:48,511
No, I'm having a nice time.

338
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,688
Don't patronize me.

339
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,058
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,032
Pardon me.

341
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,760
Pardon me. Excuse me.

342
00:14:58,762 --> 00:14:59,713
Hi, Stuart.

343
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,602
Hi, Sheldon.

344
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:02,422
Pardon me... Excuse me...

345
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:09,609
Sheldon, what are
you doing here?

346
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:12,425
The thought of you
sitting in a darkened theater

347
00:15:12,427 --> 00:15:15,605
with a character
like Stuart is repellent.

348
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:19,058
No offense, Stuart.

349
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,638
None taken.

350
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,630
Although "repellent" is kind
of a... kind of a strong word.

351
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,481
I'm sorry this causes
you discomfort,

352
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,872
but based on the currently
established parameters

353
00:15:32,874 --> 00:15:34,919
of our relationship,
I can put myself

354
00:15:34,921 --> 00:15:36,643
in any repellent
situation I want.

355
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:38,480
Um, again...

356
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:40,722
Stuart, please.
You're being rude.

357
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,388
Anything else?

358
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,912
I believe I would like to alter

359
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,648
the paradigm
of our relationship.

360
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,508
I'm listening.

361
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,426
With the understanding
that nothing changes whatsoever,

362
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:02,226
physical or otherwise,

363
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,827
I would not object to us

364
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:09,864
no longer characterizing you
as "not my girlfriend."

365
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:18,136
Interesting.

366
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:21,208
Now try it without the
quadruple negative.

367
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,595
You're being impossible.

368
00:16:24,597 --> 00:16:26,613
Hi, Stuart.

369
00:16:28,677 --> 00:16:31,675
Fine.

370
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:38,222
Amy... will you be my girlfriend?

371
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:45,775
Yes.

372
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,115
Well, that's enough of that.

373
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,617
Sorry to interrupt.

374
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:52,618
You two enjoy your date.

375
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,373
Here's a dollar
for your troubles.

376
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,352
Get yourself
some Sour Patch Kids.

377
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,265
Excuse me... Excuse me...
Pardon me...

378
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,622
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

379
00:17:02,018 --> 00:17:06,077
So, other than you
taking your relationship

380
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,986
to the next level with
another guy, this was nice.

381
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:14,302
Yes, well, thanks for
seeing me to my door.

382
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:15,596
Oh, you're welcome.

383
00:17:15,598 --> 00:17:19,310
Amy. Amy. Amy.

384
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:24,437
Let's wrap things up out there.

385
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:29,898
Um, good night, Stuart.

386
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,623
Good night.

387
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,370
Take the hint, Stuart.

388
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:36,369
The lady said
"Good night."

389
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,136
How did you get
into my apartment?

390
00:17:42,138 --> 00:17:44,739
Wow. Is that the kind
of nagging I can expect

391
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:46,236
now that you're my girlfriend?

392
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,436
Good thing I drew this up.

393
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:51,935
What's that?

394
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,835
I present to you
the relationship agreement.

395
00:17:59,628 --> 00:18:02,346
A binding covenant that,
in its 31 pages,

396
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,358
enumerates, iterates
and codifies

397
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,496
the rights and responsibilities
of Sheldon Lee Cooper,

398
00:18:07,498 --> 00:18:09,500
here and after known
as "the boyfriend,"

399
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:14,695
and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and
after known as "the girlfriend."

400
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:20,056
It's so romantic.

401
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:21,823
Mutual indemnification
always is.

402
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:29,964
Why don't you start perusing
while I set up my notary stamp.

403
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:33,323
"Section 5: Hand-holding.

404
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,710
"Hand-holding
is only allowed

405
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,347
"under the following
circumstances.

406
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,085
A) Either party is in danger
of falling off a cliff,

407
00:18:39,087 --> 00:18:40,897
"precipice or ledge;

408
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,423
"B) Either party is deserving
of a hearty handshake

409
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:46,007
"after winning a Nobel Prize;

410
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:49,011
C) Moral support during flu shots."

411
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,667
Seems a bit restrictive.

412
00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:00,347
Feel free to retain a lawyer.

413
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:10,650
Penny, I said "right hand red."

414
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:11,657
Yeah, I heard you.

415
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:14,687
I got red.

416
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:19,310
Bernadette, left foot yellow.

417
00:19:20,569 --> 00:19:22,903
We should play limbo next.

418
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:24,754
No one beats me at limbo.

419
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,827
Penny. Amy. Bernadette.

420
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:33,340
That's my boyfriend.

421
00:19:33,342 --> 00:19:34,709
It's open!

422
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:37,297
I got a splinter.

423
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:40,304
What do you want me
to do about it?

424
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:43,357
Relationship agreement
Section 4: Boo-boos and Ouchies.

425
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,107
You have to take care of it.

426
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,064
I should've gotten a lawyer.

427
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,807
Looks like it's just us playing.

428
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:01,451
Penny?

429
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,108
Penny, we're out of wine!

430
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,506
You should probably drive.

9999
