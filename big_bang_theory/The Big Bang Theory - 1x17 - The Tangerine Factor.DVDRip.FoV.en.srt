1
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:05,745
No, it's.

2
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,193
What's this?

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,029
That's what you did.

4
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:22,467
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

5
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,233
- Well, it's not.
- Why am I supposed to know that?

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:28,900
As teacher, it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,512
...from the subject matter.

8
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,845
- I'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
- Why?

9
00:00:34,017 --> 00:00:37,953
Once you're fluent, you'll have a
billion more people to annoy instead of me.

10
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:40,613
Hey.

11
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,524
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

12
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:51,126
My apologies, Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,332
Why are you learning Chinese?

14
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,764
I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off orange chicken...

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,103
...as tangerine chicken,
and I intend to confront them.

16
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:04,810
If I were you, I'd be more concerned
about what they're passing off as chicken.

17
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:11,115
- I need to use your window.
- Oh, hey. Yeah, no, sure, go ahead.

18
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,514
Hey, jerk face. You forgot your iPod.

19
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:19,657
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

20
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:23,492
That stupid, self-centered bastard
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

21
00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:29,503
Drop dead,
you stupid, self-centered bastard.

22
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:32,597
Thank you.

23
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:37,202
Okay, where were we?

24
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,978
Not now. I have a blog to find.

25
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,171
Penny, are you okay?

26
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:15,579
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away.

27
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,154
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

28
00:02:19,322 --> 00:02:22,223
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better, bye.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,954
She doesn't wanna talk.

30
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:31,457
Not surprising.

31
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:36,071
Penny's emotional responses originate in the
primitive portion of brain, the amygdala.

32
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,037
While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

33
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,007
Former can overpower the latter
giving scientific credence...

34
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:45,011
...to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

35
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,645
Or maybe she just doesn't wanna talk.

36
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,192
Hey, look, I found an iPod.

37
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,992
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

38
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,866
What else?
Sell it on eBay as slightly used.

39
00:03:08,371 --> 00:03:10,669
It was Penny's boyfriend's.
They broke up.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,708
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship on his blog...

41
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:17,904
...which I cannot find anywhere.

42
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:21,582
You know what? I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

43
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:24,777
Good idea.
Sit with her, hold her, comfort her.

44
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:29,186
And if the moment feels right,
see if you can cop a feel.

45
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,585
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

46
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:36,562
I'm not aware of any social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

47
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,530
What about damsel in distress?

48
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:42,330
Twelfth-century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

49
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,435
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

50
00:03:46,276 --> 00:03:48,540
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

51
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:52,078
Remember to sit on your hands a bit
so they're warm.

52
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,482
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

53
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,923
So you're saying, if in the depths of despair
she throws herself at you...

54
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,719
...and demands you take her right there,
right now, you'll just walk away?

55
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,358
I said I'm her friend, not her gay friend.

56
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,160
Hey, I know you said
you didn't wanna talk...

57
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,896
- I don't.
- Okay, sorry.

58
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,975
- Wait.
- Wait. Did you say wait?

59
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,469
Tell me the truth.

60
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,740
Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?

61
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,383
No, no.

62
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:32,078
Okay, so I pick good guys,
but turn them into losers?

63
00:04:32,255 --> 00:04:33,279
Of course not.

64
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:36,425
Well, it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

65
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,664
I'm sorry. What were the choices again?

66
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,961
I really thought Mike was different.

67
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:50,196
I thought he was sensitive and smart.

68
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,397
I mean, not you smart.

69
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:54,702
- Normal non-freaky smart.
- Yeah, no, sure.

70
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,539
You know, and then he just goes
and has to humiliate me...

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:01,343
...by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

72
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,610
Actually, it's not all that easy to find.

73
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:07,244
Yeah, really? Well, my friends at work
found it, my sister found it.

74
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:12,451
Judging by my e-mail, a number of prisoners
at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.

75
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:14,562
What exactly did this guy write?

76
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,325
Not that I need to know
the details of your sex life.

77
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,694
I just thought...

78
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:20,795
Never mind.

79
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,762
No, you know what?

80
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:26,136
Might as well read it,
everybody else has. Go ahead.

81
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:29,710
Oh, God, I just feel so betrayed
and embarrassed.

82
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,178
I just wanna crawl into a hole and die.

83
00:05:36,352 --> 00:05:38,843
Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad.

84
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:42,483
It just paints the picture
of a very affectionate woman...

85
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:47,994
...who's open to expressing her affection
in nontraditional locales.

86
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,995
Oh, God.

87
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:55,263
Elevators, parks, movie theaters.

88
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,570
Out of curiosity...

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,904
...is this subway, the transportation system,
or Subway, the sandwich shop?

90
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,911
Sandwich shop.

91
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,346
Doesn't that violate
the health code or?

92
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,877
No, at the sub shop,
we were only making out.

93
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,983
Ah, okay.

94
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:17,593
But my point is that you have absolutely
no reason to be embarrassed.

95
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,996
Really? Do you think I overreacted?

96
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,133
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that, I do overreact.

97
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,700
- Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.
- No, no.

98
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:29,394
No, that would be under-reacting.

99
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,139
He did break the implied confidentiality
of the bedroom...

100
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:37,541
...and in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast-food franchise.

101
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,237
Yes, you're right.

102
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,542
I should just say I am done with him.

103
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes you should. Go ahead, say it.

104
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,748
But I never gave the man a chance
to explain.

105
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:49,925
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

106
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,061
It's betrayal.

107
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:54,458
No, you were right the first time.

108
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,461
This is a man who loves me...

109
00:06:56,632 --> 00:07:01,160
...but in his own stupid way was just trying
to show people how he feels.

110
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,765
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

111
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,435
No, you did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

112
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:09,976
Oh, good for me.

113
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,312
- Where are you going?
- I'm going over to Mike's.

114
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:17,282
- Leonard, thank you so much.
- Oh, sure.

115
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,886
Huh.

116
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,358
Maybe I am her gay friend.

117
00:07:32,935 --> 00:07:35,199
Howard, I'm going
to need another Mandarin lesson.

118
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:38,807
I obviously didn't make my point
with those people.

119
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,910
For God's sake,
if you don't like tangerine chicken...

120
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,602
...don't order tangerine chicken.

121
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,976
I like tangerine chicken.
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

122
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,150
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

123
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,547
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her old boyfriend.

124
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,787
Just roll the dice.

125
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:05,562
"Enslaved by warlocks.
Stay here till you roll two, four or... "

126
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,464
She was mad at him.

127
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,972
She was done with him,
the relationship was broken...

128
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,337
...and I walked over there and I fixed it.

129
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,312
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

130
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,446
I thought the first two renditions
were far more compelling.

131
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:25,086
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character.

132
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,246
Now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

133
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,655
Just eat your tangerine chicken.

134
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,694
I'd love to,
but I don't have tangerine chicken.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,102
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice.

136
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,537
Incredible.

137
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,543
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

138
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,850
I'm back.

139
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:02,049
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
It's not your fault.

140
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,516
What happened?

141
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:07,129
Well, I went over to Mike's
to make up with him...

142
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,321
Yeah, no, I know that part.

143
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,767
But he had already moved on.

144
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,692
Already? That was quick.

145
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:18,738
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs wrapped around his neck.

146
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,911
Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.

147
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,309
How could he do that?

148
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,973
Oh, you know,
you did throw an 80-gig iPod...

149
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,051
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

150
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,747
I swear to God,
I am done with guys like that.

151
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:38,883
You know, macho with the perfect body,
and the hair and the money.

152
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:41,393
Yeah, that must get old quick.

153
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:47,767
You know, just once, I would like to go out
with someone who is nice and honest...

154
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:50,098
...and who actually cares about me.

155
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,098
What about me?

156
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:55,967
What about you what?

157
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:00,844
What about if you went out with me?

158
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:04,683
Are you asking me out?

159
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:09,754
Um, yes, I am asking you out.

160
00:10:11,394 --> 00:10:13,385
Wow.

161
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:16,260
I was just going off your comment
about the nice guy...

162
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,865
- No, I got that.
- And honest...

163
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,626
- Yeah, totally.
- So but...

164
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,099
- It's no big deal.
- Yes.

165
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,166
Yes, what?

166
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:26,973
Yes, I will go out with you.

167
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:31,845
Really?

168
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:34,981
Yeah.

169
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,018
Why not?
I mean, what do I have to lose?

170
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,920
Yeah.

171
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,457
That's the spirit.

172
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:50,722
Show me your citrus peels.

173
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,571
Show me your citrus peels.

174
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,744
- Show me...
- Sheldon?

175
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,839
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,573
Look, do you have a second?

177
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,516
A second what? Pair of underwear?

178
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:14,883
I was just wondering
if I could talk to you.

179
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:16,081
It's about Leonard.

180
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,425
Why me?
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

181
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,086
Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk.

182
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:25,722
And Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

183
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:28,901
Yes, I suppose he is.

184
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,599
All I'm saying
is you know Leonard the best.

185
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:37,041
Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

186
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:42,173
Just the other day, I discovered
he not only has a loofah, he hides it.

187
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:45,149
Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

188
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:48,757
I myself prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally...

189
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,223
...but I don't condemn those
who seek to accelerate the process.

190
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:57,021
And until recently, I had no idea
that despite his lactose intolerance...

191
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,724
...he can tolerate small amounts
of nonfat ice cream...

192
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:01,802
...without producing a noxious gas...

193
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,338
...that, I maintain, in the right concentration
could be weaponized.

194
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:08,842
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

195
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,276
We're not done?

196
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,913
- No.
- Eh, why not?

197
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,882
We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

198
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,856
Okay, so here's the thing.

199
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,995
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

200
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:28,925
Well, he didn't actually say anything.

201
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:31,999
But when he came back to the apartment,
he was doing a dance...

202
00:12:32,167 --> 00:12:35,102
<i>...that brought to mind
the happy hippos in Fantasia.</i>

203
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,672
Oh, that's nice.

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,104
Anyhow,
the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

205
00:12:40,276 --> 00:12:43,643
...you know, since Leonard
and I have become friends, I was just...

206
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:44,836
Wanna sit down?

207
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,849
Oh, I wish it were that simple.

208
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,249
You see, I don't spend much time here,
and so I've never chosen a place to sit.

209
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:55,356
Well, choose.

210
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,516
There are a number of options and...

211
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,492
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities...

212
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:05,691
...air-flow patterns and dispersion
of sunlight to make an informed choice.

213
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,634
Why don't you pick at random, if you
don't like it, sit somewhere else next time?

214
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,796
No, no, that's crazy.

215
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:16,644
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

216
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:18,537
Okay.

217
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,042
Here's the thing.

218
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:25,550
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had a little crush on me...

219
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,450
A little crush?

220
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,051
Well, I suppose so.

221
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:33,058
In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

222
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,922
I don't really know who they are...

223
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:39,499
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...
- Yeah, I don't care. Listen.

224
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,329
The point is...

225
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,233
...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

226
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,864
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

227
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,644
Would you be open
to rotating the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

228
00:13:51,814 --> 00:13:56,274
No. What I'm saying is,
Leonard might be different in a good way.

229
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,813
And obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

230
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:04,153
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

231
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,787
Oh, glare.

232
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,322
But on the other hand...

233
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:12,990
...if things don't go well with Leonard,
I risk losing a really good friend.

234
00:14:13,168 --> 00:14:14,931
I mean, he's not looking for a fling.

235
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,063
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for, like you would say, light-years.

236
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,333
I would not say that.

237
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,139
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance, not time.

238
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:27,373
Thank you for the clarification.

239
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,151
Draft.

240
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:39,922
You see, people hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

241
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:43,622
Foot-pound has the same problem.
That's a unit of work, not of weight.

242
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,959
Right. Thanks.

243
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,592
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

244
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,299
Okay.

245
00:14:51,106 --> 00:14:53,597
I think this will be my seat.

246
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,444
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do...

247
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:58,637
...with, you know,
what I'm talking about?

248
00:14:59,381 --> 00:15:01,246
Well, let's see.

249
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,741
We might consider Schrödinger's cat.

250
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,980
Schrödinger. Is that the woman in 2A?

251
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,418
No, that's Mrs. Grossinger.

252
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:12,048
She doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican
hairless. Annoying little animal. Yip-yip-yip.

253
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,717
Sheldon.

254
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,225
Sorry, you diverted me.

255
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:20,835
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger,
in an attempt to explain...

256
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,666
...the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
physics, he proposed an experiment.

257
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,469
A cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison...

258
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,544
...that will break open at a random time.

259
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:34,513
Now, since no one knows
when or if the poison has been released...

260
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:40,178
...until the box is opened, the cat
can be thought of as both alive and dead.

261
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,785
I'm sorry, I don't get the point.

262
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,988
Well, of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

263
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,728
You have to be psychic,
there's no such thing...

264
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:55,460
Sheldon, what's the point?

265
00:15:55,637 --> 00:15:59,266
Just like Schrödinger's cat,
your potential relationship with Leonard...

266
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:02,137
...right now
can be thought of as both good and bad.

267
00:16:02,311 --> 00:16:06,247
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

268
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,976
Okay, so you're saying
I should go out with Leonard?

269
00:16:10,152 --> 00:16:12,120
No, no, no.

270
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,715
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrödinger...

271
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,922
Two seats right there.

272
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,641
Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.

273
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,210
I can see that.
Unless you're running a marathon...

274
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,475
...choosing both stuffing and mashed
potatoes is a starch-filled redundancy.

275
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,412
No, it's about Penny.

276
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,383
A mistake involving Penny.

277
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,580
Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.

278
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:51,783
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,291
Then don't.

280
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,791
Other people would say, "Why not?"

281
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:58,194
Other people might be interested.

282
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:02,569
- I'm gonna talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

283
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:08,142
Now that I'm actually about to go out
with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

284
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,107
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

285
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,371
Starch absorbs fluid...

286
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:15,142
...which reduces the amount
of vomit available for violent expulsion.

287
00:17:15,851 --> 00:17:18,183
- Right.
- You also made a grammatical mistake.

288
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,787
You said "nauseous"
when you meant "nauseated. "

289
00:17:22,024 --> 00:17:23,457
But go on.

290
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,687
Sheldon, this date
is probably my one chance with Penny.

291
00:17:26,862 --> 00:17:28,227
What happens if I blow it?

292
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:33,263
Well, if we accept your premise and also
accept the highly improbable assumption...

293
00:17:33,435 --> 00:17:35,995
...that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you...

294
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:38,969
...we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it...

295
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,372
...would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

296
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,978
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers...

297
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,479
<i>...from Scooby-Doo cartoons
comes to mind.</i>

298
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:49,583
You're not helping.

299
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:51,514
All right, what response on my part...

300
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,985
...would bring this conversation
to a conclusion?

301
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,716
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

302
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,325
Schrödinger's cat.

303
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,526
Wow, that's brilliant.

304
00:18:02,397 --> 00:18:04,331
You sound surprised.

305
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:07,798
Mmm.

306
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,955
- Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:30,853
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

308
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,351
You look very nice.

309
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,018
Thank you. So do you.

310
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,360
I made an 8:00 reservation.

311
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:43,834
Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

312
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:45,906
Maybe we should talk first.

313
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,965
Oh.

314
00:18:48,143 --> 00:18:49,303
Okay.

315
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:54,647
But before you say anything,
have you ever heard of Schrödinger's cat?

316
00:18:56,818 --> 00:19:00,720
Actually, I've heard
far too much about Schrödinger's cat.

317
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,022
Good.

318
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:11,895
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.
