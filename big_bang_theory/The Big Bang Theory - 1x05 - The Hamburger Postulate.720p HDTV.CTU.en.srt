1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,300
All right!
I'm moving my infantry division.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,600
Augmented by bataillon of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,400
We flank the Tennessee volunteers

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,500
and the North, once again,
wins the battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,100
Not so fast!

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,400
Remember, the South still has
two infantry divisions,

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,300
plus Superman and Godzilla.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,200
No, orcs are magic. Superman
is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,500
Not to mention you already lost Godzilla
to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,000
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,300
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on, honey.

12
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,700
Shiva and Ganesh,

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,200
the Hindu gods,
against the entire Union army?

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
And orcs.

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,400
I'll be back.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Excuse me.

17
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,600
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles
and Shiva is the Destroyer.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,400
When the smoke clears,
Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,000
and drinking mint juleps.

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,900
My boss says you have to either order
or leave and never come back.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,700
What do you recommend for someone
who worked up a man-sized appetite

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,000
from a morning of weight training
and cardio funk?

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
A shower.

24
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,400
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,900
All right, thank you,
and Sheldon?

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,300
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,100
- It's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

29
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,200
I like hamburgers
where we usually have them.

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,700
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like them here.

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,700
- Give him a hamburger.
- Which one?

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,800
The Classic Burger,
the Ranch House Burger,

34
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,700
the Barbecue Burger,
or the Kobe Burger?

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,600
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,500
They only have one burger...
the Big Boy.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,600
The Barbecue Burger's like the Big Boy.

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Excuse me, in a world
that already includes a Big Boy,

39
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,400
why would I settle for
something like a Big Boy?

40
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,600
Because you're not at Big Boy!

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
- Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
- Make it two.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,900
Waitresses don't yell at you
at Big Boy.

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Hey, Leonard.
Hi, guys.

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,000
Hi, Leslie.

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,400
I didn't know you ate here.

46
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,600
We don't.
This is a disturbing aberration.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,100
Leslie, this is Penny.

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,100
She lives across the hall
from Sheldon and me.

49
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,800
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

50
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,700
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

51
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,200
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
Wow, a girl scientist.

53
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,000
Yep, come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

54
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Glad I ran into you.

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,200
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

56
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,700
What happened to Elliot Wong?

57
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
He switched over
to high-energy radiation research,

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
had a little mishap,
and now the other guys

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,600
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

60
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
- You're in?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

61
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,700
Great, we rehearse
on Tuesdays at your place.

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Why at my place?

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,300
Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

64
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,900
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you, too.

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,500
I didn't know you played the cello.

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,900
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,200
and putting me
in Advanced Placement classes

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,300
wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

69
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,900
If you're into music,
I happen to be a human beatbox.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Really?

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm actually not that into music.

72
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,200
Your friend's really cute.

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,900
Anything going on with you two?

74
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Leslie?

75
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
No, no.

76
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
- What, are you kidding?
- He asked her out once.

77
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
It was an embarrassing failure.

78
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,100
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,800
Was that supposed to be a secret?

80
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
That's too bad.
You guys'd make a cute couple.

81
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Oh, dear.

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
- What's the matter?
- She didn't take my order.

83
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,900
How can she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

84
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,600
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

85
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,200
What did Penny mean,
"You'd make a cute couple?"

86
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
I assume she meant
the two of you together

87
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,100
would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

88
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,900
An alternate and somewhat
less likely interpretation

89
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
is that you could manufacture one.

90
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,400
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Aren't they adorable?"

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,100
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down,

93
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
then it would unambiguously mean

94
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,600
that she, Penny, thought
I should ask her, Leslie, out,

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
indicating that she had no interest
in me asking her, Penny, out.

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,300
But, because she did know
that I had asked Leslie out

97
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,200
and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down, then she, Penny,

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,200
could be offering consolation.

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,100
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple,"

100
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,700
but while thinking: "Good,
Leonard remains available."

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,700
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

102
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,100
- How so?
- You're talking to one of the three men

103
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,900
in the Western hemisphere capable
of following that train of thought.

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,800
Well, what do you think?

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
I said I could follow it.
I didn't say I care.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,000
Season 1 Episode 5:
The Hamburger Postulate

1
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,300
I admire your fingering.

2
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Thank you.

3
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,900
Maybe sometime you can try that
on my instrument.

4
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
- G'night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

5
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,200
See you next week.

6
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

7
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

8
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Sure, why not?

9
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
Just so we're clear,
you understand

10
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
that me hanging back
to practice with you

11
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,900
is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

12
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Really?

13
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,900
Yeah, I'm good to go.

14
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
I thought you weren't interested in me.

15
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,600
That was before I saw you handling

16
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,100
that beautiful piece
of wood between your legs.

17
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,600
You mean my cello?

18
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,400
No, I mean the obvious,
crude, double entendre.

19
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm seducing you.

20
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,900
No kidding.

21
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,300
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

22
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
So how about it?

23
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,400
Is it the waitress?

24
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
What about her?

25
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,800
I thought I saw your pupils
dilate when you looked at her.

26
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,200
Which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

27
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,700
I did have a poppy seed bagel
for breakfast.

28
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,800
Which could cause a positive
urine test for opiates,

29
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,600
but certainly not dilate my pupils.

30
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,300
So I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

31
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,200
You and the waitress then.

32
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
No... no.

33
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,100
There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

34
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,800
So you're open
to a sexual relationship?

35
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,900
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

36
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,700
- Good.
- Yeah, it is. It is good.

37
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,600
Did you want to start now?

38
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,000
Why don't we finish
the section first?

39
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
A little musical foreplay.
Terrific.

40
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
I'm good to go.

41
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,100
Me, too.

42
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,500
Hey, Sheldon.
What's going on?

43
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,100
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

44
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm sorry?

45
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Semiotics.
The study of signs and symbols.

46
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,000
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

47
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaing yourself,

48
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,200
but you're really not.

49
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,000
Just come with me.

50
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
- Well?
- Well, what?

51
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
What does it mean?

52
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Oh, come on,
you went to college.

53
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,900
Yes, but I was 11.

54
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,900
All right, look,
a tie on the doorknob usually means

55
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
someone doesn't want to be disturbed

56
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,900
because, they're...
you know, gettin' busy.

57
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,000
So you're saying Leonard
has a girl in there?

58
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,500
Well, either that
or he's lost his tie rack

59
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,700
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

60
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

61
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,200
We really shouldn't be standing here.

62
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
This is very awkward.

63
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,800
Oh, come on, Leonard's had
girls over before, right?

64
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,100
Yes, but there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice...

65
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,300
Last time, I was able to book a cruise
to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

66
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,000
You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

67
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,200
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

68
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
So, do you know who's in there?

69
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,900
Well, there's Leonard.

70
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,100
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

71
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,400
Good for him.

72
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,900
Good for Leonard.

73
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,800
Okay, g'night.

74
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
No, no, wait, hold on.

75
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,800
What's the matter?

76
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,100
I don't know what the protocol is here.

77
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,600
Do I stay? Do I leave?

78
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,700
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

79
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
You're asking the wrong girl.

80
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm usually
on the other side of the tie.

81
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,300
Hi, Leonard?

82
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,100
It's me, Sheldon...

83
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,700
In the living room.

84
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,600
I just... I wanted you
to know I saw the tie.

85
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,100
Message received.

86
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,300
You're welcome.

87
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
You carry on.

88
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,000
Give my best to Leslie.

1
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Big Boy...

2
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,100
Someone touched my board.

3
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,300
Oh, God, my board!

4
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Hey, what's the matter?

5
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,600
My equations, someone's tampered
with my equations.

6
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

7
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,700
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

8
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,400
The sign's been changed.

9
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, yeah.

10
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,900
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

11
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

12
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,300
Are you-- Look!

13
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,800
That fixes the problem
I've been having.

14
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,300
You're welcome.

15
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,600
You did this?

16
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,600
I noticed it when I got up
to get a glass of water. So I fixed it.

17
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Now you can show that quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

18
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,900
Pretty cool, huh?

19
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,300
"Cool"?

20
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,400
Listen, I've got to get to the lab.
Thanks for a great night.

21
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,600
Thank you.
I'll see you at work.

22
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,800
Hold on. Hold on!

23
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,800
- What?
- Who told you you could touch my board?

24
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
No one.

25
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,700
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

26
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,400
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

27
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, that is so...

28
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
so...

29
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,500
Sorry, I've got to run. If you come up
with an adjective, text me.

30
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,200
Inconsiderate.

31
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,800
That is the adjective,
"inconsiderate. "

32
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,700
You can stare at your board all day.
She's still going to be right.

33
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm not staring, I'm hauling.

34
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
So...

35
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
how's it going?

36
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,600
Pretty good.

37
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,100
Just pretty good?
I'd think you were doing very good.

38
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,300
Pretty, very...
there's really no objective scale

39
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
for delineating variations of "good."
Why do you ask?

40
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,500
Well, a little bird told me

41
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,900
that you and Leslie
hooked up last night.

42
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
So, is it serious?
Do you like her?

43
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,100
I don't...

44
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,100
That's really two different questions.

45
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm not...

46
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,400
Sheldon, we have to go!

47
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,100
You're wound awfully tight for a man
who's just had sexual intercourse.

48
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,400
All right, I'll talk to you later,
but I am so happy for you.

49
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Thank you.

50
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
What did she mean
she's happy for me?

51
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,700
Is she happy that
I'm seeing someone?

52
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
Or is she happy because
she thinks that I am?

53
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy.

54
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,600
Even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

55
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,400
Because the second person,
though happy,

56
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

57
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

58
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
You know what?

59
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,900
I'm being ridiculous.

60
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,600
Who cares what Penny thinks?

61
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,100
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive.

62
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,800
We like each other.
She's extremely intelligent...

63
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,700
- She's not that intelligent.
- She fixed your equation.

64
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,900
- She got lucky.
- You don't believe in luck.

65
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,600
I don't have to believe
in it for her to be lucky.

66
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,500
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

67
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not going to pass that up

68
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,300
for some hypothetical future
of happiness with a woman

69
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,900
who may or may not
want me to be happy,

70
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,800
with a woman who is
currently making me happy.

71
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,100
I still don't care.

72
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,800
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

73
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

74
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,300
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

75
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
So anyway...

76
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Hello.

77
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,100
What are you doing?

78
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,400
Just extending the intimacy.

79
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,000
Do you want to slip over
to the radiation lab

80
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,500
and share a decontamination shower?

81
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,800
What exactly do you think's
going on between us?

82
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

83
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,500
Listen,
neither of us are neuroscientists,

84
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,600
but we both understand
the biochemistry of sex.

85
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
I mean, dopamine in our brains

86
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
is released across synapses,
causing pleasure.

87
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,000
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button,

88
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,200
he'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

89
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,800
Well, who wouldn't?

90
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Well, the only difference
between us and the rat

91
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,700
is that you can't stick an
electrode in our hypothalamus.

92
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,300
That's where you come in.

93
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,200
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
to be a part of it.

94
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,800
So what happens now?

95
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,600
I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

96
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,700
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

97
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,900
You want to make plans for New Year's?

98
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,500
Please.
You're smothering me.

99
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Look. It's Dr. Stud!

100
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Dr. What?

101
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
The blogosphere is a-buzzin'
with news of you and Leslie Winkle

102
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,600
making <i>eine kleine
bang-bang musik</i>.

103
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,900
How did it get on the Internet?

104
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
I put it there.

105
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,900
How did you know about it?

106
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,600
A little bird told us.

107
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,400
Apparently,
you are a magnificent beast.

108
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
That part's true.

1
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,800
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

2
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
- No kidding.
- I don't want to go out on a limb,

3
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

4
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,500
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

5
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,800
Way ahead of you. I was thinking
of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,

6
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
and just dropping Souplantation.

7
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,300
Really?

8
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
The name always confused me anyway.
Souplantation.

9
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,600
You can't grow soup.

10
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,800
So, how's everything?

11
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,000
Terrific. You'll be happy to know
that I plan to come here

12
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,100
every Tuesday night
for the foreseeable future.

13
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Really?

14
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,600
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

15
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,800
I don't know...
A psychiatrist?

16
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
So, hey,

17
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,800
how are things with you and Leslie?

18
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,400
To be honest, I don't think
it's going to work out.

19
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,300
Oh, that's too bad.

20
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,900
Hey, don't worry.

21
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,300
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

22
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,000
What did she mean by that?!

23
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,100
Was that just a generic platitude,

24
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,200
or was that a subtle bid
for attention?

25
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,300
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

26
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
This is a single-decker hamburger,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

27
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,600
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

28
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,700
Are you even listening to me?

29
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,600
Of course, I'm listening.
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion...

30
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Okay, then.

31
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,600
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
