1
00:00:01,677 --> 00:00:04,145
So what kind of cruise
is this you're going on?

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:07,015
It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

3
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:10,401
Christian Quarterly gave
it their highest rating--

4
00:00:10,403 --> 00:00:12,821
five thorny crowns.

5
00:00:12,823 --> 00:00:15,156
I do wish you'd
come with me, Sheldon.

6
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:19,027
Well, Mom, if I did, it
would be conclusive proof

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:21,246
that your God
can work miracles.

8
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:23,348
You're missing out.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,782
It's gonna
be wall-to-wall fun.

10
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:25,834
It's all themed.

11
00:00:25,836 --> 00:00:27,818
There's Jonah
and the Whale Watching.

12
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:32,340
All-you-can-eat
Last Supper Buffet.

13
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,709
And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

14
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:38,263
What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask.

15
00:00:38,265 --> 00:00:40,965
Oh, it is a hoot
and a half.

16
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,668
You write your sins
on a clay pigeon,

17
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,803
they fire 'em up in the air,
and you pulverize them

18
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:47,555
with a 12-gauge shotgun

19
00:00:47,557 --> 00:00:51,609
full of our Lord's
forgiveness.

20
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:54,362
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged
to see how advanced

21
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:56,364
your group has become--
willing to sail out

22
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:59,951
into the ocean without fear
of falling off the edge.

23
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,736
For example,

24
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:03,621
if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write,

25
00:01:03,623 --> 00:01:05,790
"Smart mouth"
on his pigeon,

26
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,627
and then bam!

27
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,130
The Lord giveth and
the Lord bloweth away.

28
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:13,414
Well, Mom,

29
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:16,301
according to my itinerary
for our weekend together,

30
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:18,117
the fun begins with
fried chicken.

31
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:19,342
Sounds delicious.

32
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,639
Good, 'cause I got you everything
you need to make it.

33
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,158
You are in for a treat.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,510
My mother's fried chicken

35
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:29,347
is why we had to buy my dad
the extra large coffin.

36
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,382
Sheldon, she just
got off the plane.

37
00:01:31,384 --> 00:01:32,817
She doesn't want to cook.

38
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,269
Of course she does.

39
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:36,988
Making me food is her way
of saying "I love you""

40
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,190
Making me food when
she's too tired to cook

41
00:01:39,192 --> 00:01:41,326
is her way of saying
"I really love you."

42
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:43,912
Actually, I wouldn't mind going
out for a bite, Sheldon.

43
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:45,363
Won't that spoil our appetites

44
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:47,231
for the chicken you're
going to make me?

45
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:49,200
All right, that settles it, we're
going out. Do you like sushi?

46
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,836
There's a great little
place down the street.

47
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,479
I've never had it,
but there's no harm in

48
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:54,722
trying something new.

49
00:01:55,575 --> 00:01:58,075
There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

50
00:01:58,077 --> 00:01:59,838
That's why we test out
drugs and cosmetics

51
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,063
on bunny rabbits.

52
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:04,632
Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

53
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:08,019
Actually, I had him
tested as a child.

54
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:09,771
Doctor says he's fine.

55
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,356
Told you.

56
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,358
Although, I do regret
not following up

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,976
with that specialist in Houston.

Irasshaimase!

69
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:49,356
Stop yelling!

70
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,836
I'm not happy about this.

71
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,855
What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

72
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,608
The prospect
of fried chicken.

73
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,011
This is exciting.

74
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,397
Back home, the diner on
Route Four serves sushi,

75
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:05,900
but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

76
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,518
They put it on the menu

77
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,073
in those kung fu letters,
but that don't make it sushi.

78
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:16,711
Uh, kung fu letters might
not be politically correct.

79
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:20,331
Oh, I thought the one we
couldn't say was "ching chong""

80
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,752
Yeah, yeah, that, too.

81
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,553
So, Shelly, what's up

82
00:03:25,555 --> 00:03:27,422
with you and your friend Amy,

83
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,641
if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

84
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:33,178
Well, there's actually
big news on the Amy front.

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,634
She's been studying the

86
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,305
neurobiology of addiction
in lower animals.

87
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,769
She's this close to getting
a starfish hooked on cocaine.

88
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:44,322
Do you have any idea what's
going on with those two?

89
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,574
It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

90
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:47,997
Maybe there's something
there, maybe there isn't.

91
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:49,222
We'll probably never know.

92
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,166
But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,089
How are you doing on
the young lady front?

94
00:04:01,091 --> 00:04:03,958
I hear you're in some sort
of a long distance situation?

95
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,244
Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

96
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,545
It's kind of tough.

97
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,080
She's in India.

98
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,932
Also, her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

99
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:12,917
Oh, that's funny
turn, isn't it?

100
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,388
You never think about it
going the other way.

101
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:22,610
Well, you can't force things.

102
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,762
You need to figure out if
you're in a relationship

103
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,397
or if you're just
calling it one.

104
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,233
It's like they say--
a cat can have kittens

105
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,820
in the oven but that
don't make 'em biscuits.

106
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,938
And that reminds me
of another saying.

107
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,067
You can lead a chicken
to Crisco, but you can't

108
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,371
make your mother fry it.

109
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:42,914
Sheldon, you pester me one
more time about chicken,

110
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:46,217
I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

111
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,088
Please pester her.
Please, for me.

112
00:04:53,642 --> 00:04:55,977
So, Mrs. Cooper, what did
you think of the sushi?

113
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,228
It was good.

114
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,647
The only thing that would
have made it better

115
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,683
is if it was cooked

116
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:05,019
and if it was beef.

117
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:08,156
Sheldon, when is your landlord
going to fix the elevator?

118
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,941
I don't know.

119
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,659
Lately we've been talking about

120
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:15,113
converting it
into a missile silo.

121
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,248
Your son seems to think

122
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,752
we need to launch
a preemptive strike on Burbank.

123
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,705
Get them before
they get us.

124
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:33,381
Hey, look who decided
to show up.

125
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:35,383
Raj, what are you doing?

126
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:39,721
I couldn't find you guys
so I bought six new friends.

127
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:44,209
Three, sadly, are dead.

128
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,444
Mom, you
remember Rajesh?

129
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,563
- Rajesh, my mother.
- Of course.

130
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:50,782
Mrs. Cooper.
So nice to see you again.

131
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,318
Well, it's so nice
to see you, too.

132
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,521
I thought it was
our Indians

133
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,858
that had the occasional
alcohol problem.

134
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,879
We don't say that, either.

135
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:08,917
I'll make you a list.

136
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:10,969
Oh, that would be mighty
white of you.

137
00:06:12,871 --> 00:06:16,674
So, Raj, what pain
are you trying

138
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,927
to cover up with alcohol?

139
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:20,678
- Nothing, I'm fine.
- Are ya?

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,814
No.

141
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:23,932
That's better.

142
00:06:23,934 --> 00:06:25,366
Now tell me what's
bothering you.

143
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,685
I'm so lonely.

144
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,238
Oh, yes, born alone,
die alone.

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,523
It's a tragic
human condition.

146
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,575
Now, Raj,

147
00:06:33,577 --> 00:06:34,892
if you'll excuse my mother,

148
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,694
she's about to make a pecan pie

149
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,580
that'll be so good
I'll almost forget

150
00:06:38,582 --> 00:06:40,748
how she blew it
with the fried chicken.

151
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,784
Sheldon, your
friend is hurtin'.

152
00:06:42,786 --> 00:06:44,752
What do we do when
someone's hurtin'?

153
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,905
Offer them a hot beverage.

154
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,407
And when they're
drunk as a skunk,

155
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,842
what beverage
do we offer?

156
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,927
Coffee.

157
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,263
And what do we do it with?

158
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,755
Now you listen to me.

159
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,775
I know you feel like
you can't find someone,

160
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:09,477
but there's a
lock for every key.

161
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:10,862
Back home, there's a girl

162
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:14,282
works at the Wal-Mart.
Tall, tall girl.

163
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:17,035
Woman could hunt
geese with a rake.

164
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,569
Thought she'd never

165
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,789
find a man, then one day,
wouldn't ya know,

166
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:24,459
Harlem Globetrotters
come to town.

167
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,445
Long story short,

168
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,631
today that woman
travels the world

169
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,499
with a semi-professional
basketball player

170
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,752
and two beautiful
mixed-race babies.

171
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:39,057
I didn't get a lot of that
because of your accent,

172
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,892
but the general tone
was soothing

173
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:42,793
and somehow I feel better.

174
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,232
I'm not going to get
my pecan pie, am I?

175
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,967
You want some Oreos?

176
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,602
- Double Stuf?
- No, regular.

177
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,355
Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

178
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:58,443
I'm glad we're finally getting
to do something together,

179
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,078
just the two of us.

180
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,341
Sure. One thing you really
miss when you're on

181
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:03,085
vacation is laundry.

182
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,284
Careful, you're using
too much Downey.

183
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:09,037
You know if my clothes get
too soft it makes me sleepy.

184
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,155
Well, this takes me back.

185
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,258
Me doing your laundry, you
next to me criticizing.

186
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,210
It is nice, isn't it?

187
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,880
Mrs. Cooper.

188
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:22,500
- Hi!
- Oh, hello, darlin'.

189
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,352
Sheldon, you didn't tell
me your mom was coming.

190
00:08:24,354 --> 00:08:26,888
It was in my weekly
e-mail blast.

191
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,789
Right between

192
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,857
"Beet season is finally here"

193
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:34,062
and "Uh-oh, red stool from
beets leads to cancer scare."

194
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,033
So, how've you been?

195
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:40,151
Good, good.

196
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,736
I hear that Leonard
has a new girlfriend.

197
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:43,204
How are you doing
with all that?

198
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,206
Oh, fine. You know,
it's been a while.

199
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,824
I'm getting
back out there.

200
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,327
Let me ask you, when
you get back out there,

201
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,913
are you wearing this?

202
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,533
Well, it's super cute on.

203
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,472
That top has paid for itself
in free drinks like ten

204
00:08:57,497 --> 00:08:58,971
times what it cost.

205
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,540
Yes, Penny has a lot
of her money tied up

206
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,707
in promiscuity futures.

207
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,010
Hon, you think

208
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,763
maybe the reason why
you're having trouble

209
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,598
finding a guy
to settle down with

210
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,934
is because you're letting them
ride the roller coaster

211
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,052
without buying a ticket?

212
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,906
Oh, they don't always get
to ride the roller coaster.

213
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:22,944
Sometimes they only get
to spin the teacups.

214
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:27,498
Now I'm going out tonight.
Would it be crazy

215
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,834
to ask you to look at the
outfit I'm going to wear?

216
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,735
Oh, not crazy at all.

217
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,037
And don't beat yourself up.

218
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,790
When I was your age, you could
have me for a car ride

219
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,575
and a bottle
of strawberry wine.

220
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:45,883
That will not be
in this week's e-mail blast.

221
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,719
So, this spring,
I get to go

222
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,589
to the International
Space Station.

223
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,643
Oh, my word,
a trip to the heavens.

224
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,980
If you ever want
to live there eternally,

225
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:01,282
I've got a good book
you could read.

226
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,202
Thanks, but I watch the
Charlie Brown Christmas special

227
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,120
every year, so I get the gist.

228
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:08,489
I bet your mom
is really proud of you.

229
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:09,791
Nope.

230
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,375
She says if I don't back out

231
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,327
she's going to go
on a hunger strike.

232
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,829
It would take years before

233
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,498
she'd be in any kind of danger,
but still.

234
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,384
I've got a treat
for us tomorrow, Mom.

235
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,636
I'm taking you

236
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:24,388
to see Saul Perlmutter
give a lecture

237
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,424
about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

238
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,758
And the best part is,

239
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,644
at the Q and A afterward,

240
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,179
I've worked up
a couple of "Q's"

241
00:10:31,181 --> 00:10:34,065
that will stump
his sorry "A."

242
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,734
I don't know, Shelly.

243
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,853
I thought we could do
a little sightseeing.

244
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,472
What sight is better
than your little boy

245
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,875
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

246
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,976
Come on, Sheldon,
we'll take your mom

247
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,662
to see the Hollywood sign,

248
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,480
the wax museum,
the Walk of Fame.

249
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,616
Ooh, maybe
a little Rodeo Drive.

250
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,785
Well, I can't spend
$12,000 on a handbag,

251
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,654
but it's free
to look upon those

252
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,157
who do with righteous
condemnation.

253
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,093
What do you say?

254
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,178
What do I say?

255
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,964
I say you people need
to stop ruining my mom's visit

256
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,935
with your sushi, and your
sadness and your slutty shirts.

257
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,104
Stop it.

258
00:11:16,358 --> 00:11:19,644
He's not talking about your
shirt. Your shirt is fine.

259
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:28,656
These are delicious.

260
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:30,941
The trick to pancakes
is bacon grease.

261
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,193
I cook everything in it.

262
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:35,996
Everything? Aren't you
worried about your health?

263
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:38,331
Oh, doctors are always
changing their mind.

264
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,033
One week bacon grease
is bad for you.

265
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,919
The next week we're not
getting enough of it.

266
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,206
Good morning, Shelly.

267
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:50,176
Mom, I want to apologize
for my behavior last night.

268
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,545
- Apology accepted.
- Great.

269
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,497
Now, you're going to love
the Perlmutter lecture.

270
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:57,517
Look, he will be stating
that the universe is older

271
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,135
than 6,000 years,
but I thought

272
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:00,804
you could stick your
fingers in your ears

273
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:03,607
and hum "Amazing Grace"
during those parts.

274
00:12:03,609 --> 00:12:06,359
I am still going out
with your friends.

275
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:08,612
But I apologized.

276
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:12,365
And that was hard for me because
I didn't do anything wrong.

277
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:18,071
Shelly, I hung out with you
in enough dusty lecture halls

278
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:19,990
while you were growing up.

279
00:12:19,992 --> 00:12:21,207
I want to go sightseeing.

280
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,692
So why don't you
have some pancakes,

281
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:23,860
get dressed and come with us.

282
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:27,414
I'm not going,
and you can't make me.

283
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,134
You're right, I can't.
Have a nice day.

284
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:34,054
Well, I'm going to stand here
until you change your mind.

285
00:12:34,056 --> 00:12:36,306
Well, then you are going
to stand there all day.

286
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,229
I'm just gonna take my bacon
grease and slide over there.

287
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:46,349
I can't believe my own
mother is abandoning me.

288
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:48,518
I am not abandoning you.

289
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,770
Sheldon, abandoning you
is leaving you in a basket

290
00:12:50,772 --> 00:12:52,072
on a church doorstep.

291
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:56,743
I am going to Hollywood and
thank a wax Ronald Reagan

292
00:12:56,745 --> 00:12:59,062
for his service
to our country.

293
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:03,867
We appear to be at a crossroads
in our relationship, Mother.

294
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:05,502
Well, I guess we are.

295
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:07,704
Sorry.
Syrup.

296
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:10,040
All right, Mom.

297
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:13,009
When you're at the Ripley's
Believe It Or Not Museum,

298
00:13:13,011 --> 00:13:16,412
if they have an exhibit about a
mother who threw away a chance

299
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:18,581
to spend the day with the
world's most wonderful son,

300
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,300
believe it,
because it's true.

301
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,355
I hadn't...

302
00:13:26,507 --> 00:13:29,225
That lecture was
a waste of time.

303
00:13:29,227 --> 00:13:31,144
I made more accurate diagrams

304
00:13:31,146 --> 00:13:33,730
of the expansion of the early
universe on the nursery wall

305
00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,765
with the contents
of my diaper.

306
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,402
Are you getting sick?

307
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,654
No, I'm just allergic to people

308
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,574
who get Nobel Prizes
for no good reason.

309
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:47,660
Sheldon, is it possible
that your foul mood--

310
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:51,965
or, to use the clinical
term, bitchiness--

311
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:54,718
is because your mother
isn't making you a priority?

312
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,923
No. Or to use the
clinical term, "nuh-uh""

313
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,809
Are you sure?
The infant-mother pair-bond

314
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,194
is the building block
of primate psychology.

315
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:05,311
Oh, there it is.

316
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:07,263
It always comes back
to monkeys with you.

317
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:10,299
Just monkeys,
monkeys, monkeys.

318
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,519
Sheldon, we're all animals.

319
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,071
And granted, there are aspects
of you that are extraordinary,

320
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:17,473
but when it comes to
emotions and relationships,

321
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,775
you're just like everybody else.

322
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:21,861
Are you trying to suggest
that my emotional problems

323
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:25,665
are no different than
those of a stupid person?

324
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,751
Actually, some research
indicates

325
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,035
that by not overthinking,

326
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,171
the less intelligent
handle emotions better.

327
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,759
Sure you're not coming
down with a cold?

328
00:14:35,761 --> 00:14:37,844
Oh, yes, the common cold.

329
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:38,962
Just like everyone else.

330
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:40,346
You'd love that,
wouldn't you?

331
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,635
Oh, this one's sweet.

332
00:14:45,637 --> 00:14:48,972
You know,
for your rosary rattlers.

333
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:54,694
Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics""
not "rosary rattlers."

334
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,646
My goodness, it's a wonder
you people in California

335
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:57,981
can talk at all.

336
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:01,401
This is like the
worst Hollywood tour ever.

337
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:03,486
What are we gonna do?
She wanted to see churches.

338
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:06,406
Hey, they have wine
here, don't they?

339
00:15:08,859 --> 00:15:12,528
None of our gods
have abs like that.

340
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,398
Yep, that's the last
Jew who did sit-ups.

341
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,135
And look where it got him.

342
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:23,473
Hey, while we're here, why
don't we all do some praying?

343
00:15:23,475 --> 00:15:25,608
Let's put a little
church in this church.

344
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,043
Oh, I'm not sure we should...

345
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:29,212
It's easy.
I'll show you how.

346
00:15:29,214 --> 00:15:30,814
Lord, Mary Cooper here.

347
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:34,267
Coming to you from
Gomorrah, California.

348
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:35,935
I want to thank you

349
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,688
for the blessing that
is my little Shelly.

350
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,574
I also want to thank you
for the continued strength

351
00:15:41,576 --> 00:15:44,744
not to coldcock him
with my Bible.

352
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,397
All right, Penny, your turn.

353
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,166
Okay, um...

354
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:51,167
Hey, God.

355
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:53,837
What's up?

356
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,257
Um, I'm good, but, uh, it would
be a big help to my family

357
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,459
if you could get my brother
to stop cooking meth.

358
00:16:02,163 --> 00:16:05,014
But no cops. Be cool.

359
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:10,253
She also goes a little overboard
on the "love thy neighbor."

360
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:13,857
Could probably use that chat
you had with Mary Magdalene.

361
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:15,859
Leonard, you're up.

362
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,727
Wasserman, you're on deck.

363
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:19,445
Okay. I don't know...

364
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:24,534
it's probably a little late
to ask you to make me taller.

365
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:31,124
Oh, um... if you could help
out with me and my girlfriend.

366
00:16:31,126 --> 00:16:33,376
She's all the way in India.
That would be great.

367
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:34,627
Hear that? Girl trouble.

368
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,413
Turns out we were both wrong
on that front.

369
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,302
How about you?

370
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,670
Oh, me? No.
Thanks, I'm good.

371
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:47,456
I'm really just trying not
to burst into flames.

372
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,177
Rajesh?

373
00:16:53,681 --> 00:16:57,567
He says he's having trouble
dropping those last five pounds.

374
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:01,571
Huh, I might have gone with
the talking-to-girls thing.

375
00:17:03,157 --> 00:17:05,158
No, you only get one wish.

376
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,812
Look at the two of us.

377
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:28,831
Me, a highly
regarded physicist.

378
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,017
The kind of mind that
comes along once,

379
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:33,102
maybe twice in a generation.

380
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,504
You, the common man,

381
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:39,142
tired from your labors
as a stockbroker,

382
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:43,346
or vacuum cleaner salesman,
or bootblack.

383
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:47,516
But deep down inside...

384
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:50,153
apparently we're just
two peas in a pod.

385
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:53,206
A regular pea,

386
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,875
and the kind of pea
that comes along once,

387
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,244
maybe twice in a generation.

388
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,699
Rain.

389
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:06,135
Another great equalizer.

390
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,004
Falling on the head
of the brilliant

391
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:10,139
and the unremarkable alike.

392
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,382
Smarty-pants.

393
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,221
Oh, Mrs. Cooper,
it smells so good.

394
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:26,439
You take notes, darlin'.

395
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,858
The real way to get a man
is with melted cheese

396
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,660
and cream of mushroom soup.

397
00:18:30,662 --> 00:18:34,330
He'll die at 50 but
his love will be true.

398
00:18:39,003 --> 00:18:41,237
I need a tissue.
This one got wet.

399
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:45,625
Here.

400
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:49,178
Thank you. Yeah, I've
learned something today.

401
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,049
You and I, in so many ways,

402
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:56,352
other than intelligence and
what counts, we're the same.

403
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:01,190
Sweetheart, are you sick?

404
00:19:01,192 --> 00:19:04,093
I hope so, because if this is
well, life isn't worth living.

405
00:19:04,095 --> 00:19:07,397
Oh, sugarpie,
you are burning up.

406
00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:09,649
- We've got to get you to bed.
- Okay.

407
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:12,101
Don't worry. Mama's here
to take care of her baby.

408
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:16,205
And just to be clear,
only her baby

409
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:17,490
and not these other people.

410
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:19,442
Of course.

411
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:22,879
Can I have tea with honey and
toast with the crust cut off?

412
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:25,498
You can have
whatever you want.

413
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,384
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best.

414
00:19:39,741 --> 00:19:41,654
Boy, last time I put
VapoRub on you,

415
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:44,606
you didn't have hair
on your chest.

416
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,910
I know, it filled in last year.

417
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:52,881
I didn't get to spend a lot of
time with you on this visit.

418
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:54,967
And whose fault was that?

419
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,953
Yours.

420
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,306
Shelly, you're not eight
years old anymore.

421
00:20:01,308 --> 00:20:03,225
We have to have
a different relationship.

422
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,143
No, we don't.

423
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,645
The one we have
works great.

424
00:20:06,647 --> 00:20:08,347
Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

425
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:10,799
Or maybe I'm part of
a new species,

426
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:12,684
that lives for
hundreds of years,

427
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:15,771
which means I'm still
basically a toddler.

428
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:18,974
Oh, I so should have
taken you to Houston.

429
00:20:22,579 --> 00:20:24,997
Does this mean you're not
going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

430
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,617
No, I will always
sing you "Soft Kitty."

434
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,962
Get out!

435
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:42,097
Well, that was rude.

436
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:45,333
Well, I know,
but he means well.

437
