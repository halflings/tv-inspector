1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay, if no one else was...

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,700
We really sucked at paintball

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Oh, that was
absolutely humiliating

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,800
Oh, come on. Some battles you win,
some battles you lose.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,600
Yes, but but you don't have to lose
to Kyle Burnsteen Barmistva party.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,100
I think we have to acknowledge,

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,500
those was some fairly savage
preadolescent jews.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,700
No, we were annihilated
by our own incompetence

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,800
and the inability of some people
to follow the chain of command.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Sheldon, let it go!

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,000
No, I want to talk about the fact
that Wolowitz shot me in the ck.

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,600
I shot you for good reason.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,800
You were leading us into disaster.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,300
I was giving clear, concise orders.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,700
You hid behind a tree yelling,
"Get the kid in the yarmulke!

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,900
Get the kid in the yarmulke!"

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,100
Oh, hey, guys.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,000
- Oh, hey, Penny. Hello.
- Morning, ma'am.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
So, how was paintball?
Did you have fun?

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,700
Sure, if you consider being fragged
by your own troops fun.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,900
You clear space on your calendar--
there will be an inquiry.

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,300
Okay.

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,500
Um, hey, I'm having a party on Saturday, 

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,200
so if you guys are around,
you should come on by.

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,400
- A party?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,000
A... "boy-girl" party?

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,800
Well, there will be boys and there will
be girls and it is a party, so...

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,900
It'll just be a bunch of my friends.

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,900
We'll have some beer, do a little dancing.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,800
Dancing?

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
Yeah, I don't know, Penny...

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
The thing is, we're not...

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,600
- No, we're really more of a... -No.

34
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,700
But thanks.Thanks for thinking of us.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
A Halloween party?

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
As in... costumes?

38
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Well, yeah.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,600
Is there a theme?

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Um, yeah, Halloween.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,500
Yes, but are the costumes
random, or genre-specific?

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,000
As usual, I'm not following.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,300
He's asking if we can come as
anyone from science fiction, fantasy...

44
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,700
- Sure.
- What about comic books?

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,700
- Fine.
- Anime?

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,100
- Of course.
- TV, film, 

47
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,500
D- and-D, manga, Greek gods,
Roman gods, Norse gods--

48
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Anything you want! Okay?

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,600
Any costume you want.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,000
Bye.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,600
Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Season 1 Episode 6:
The Middle Earth Paradigm

1
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,900
I'll get it.

2
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, no.

3
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Oh, no.

4
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,300
Make way for the fastest man alive!

5
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,600
Oh, no.

6
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,500
See, this is why I wanted to
have a costume meeting.

7
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
We all have other costumes:
We can change.

8
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,100
Or we could walk right
behind each other all night

9
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,700
and look like one person
going really fast.

10
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,600
No, no, no.

11
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,000
It's a boy-girl party, this flash runs solo.

12
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,400
Okay, how about this?

13
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
Nobody gets to be The Flash.

14
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
We all change. Agreed?

15
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Agreed.

16
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
I call Frodo!

17
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,500
Damn!

18
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
Hey.

19
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,000
Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got
stuck in the door on the bus.

20
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,300
You went with Thor?

21
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,100
What, just because I'm Indian
I can't be a Norse god?

22
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,300
"No, no, Raj has to be an Indian god."

23
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,700
That's racism.

24
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,800
I mean look at Wolowitz.He's not English, 

25
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
but he's dressed like Peter Pan.

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,700
Sheldon is neither sound nor light, 

27
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,700
but he's obviously the Doppler effect.

28
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,600
I'm not Peter Pan.

29
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm Robin Hood.

30
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,300
Really?

31
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,600
Because I sawPeter Pan, and
you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby.

32
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,100
She was a little bigger than you,
but it's basically the same look, man.

33
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,800
Hey, Sheldon, there's something
I want to talk to you about before
we go to the party.

34
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
I don't care if anybody gets it.

35
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,100
I'm going as the Doppler effect.

36
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
- No, it's not that.
- If I have to, I can demonstrate.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Terrific.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,700
this party is my first chance for Penny
to see me in the context of her social group, 

39
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,000
and I need you not to
embarrass me tonight.

40
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,600
Well, what exactly do you
mean by embarrass you?

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,700
Well, for example, tonight, 

42
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,000
no one needs to know that
my middle name is Leakey.

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,100
But there's nothing embarrassing about that.

44
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
Your father worked with Louis Leakey, 

45
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,500
a great anthropologist.

46
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,200
It had nothing to do with
your bed-wetting.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,500
All m saying is that this party is the
perfect opportunity for Penny

48
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,900
to see me as a member of her peer group, 

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,500
a potential close friend, and perhaps more, 

50
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,600
and I don't want to look like a dork.

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Just a heads up, fellas.

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
If anyone gets lucky, I've got a dozen
condoms in my quiver.

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Oh, hey, guys.

54
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,300
Hey. Sorry we're late.

55
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,200
Late?

56
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
It's 7:05.

57
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,600
And you said the party starts at 7:00.

58
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,700
Well, yeah, I mean, when you
start a party at 7:00, 

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,400
no one shows up at, you know, 7:00.

60
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,500
It's 7:05.

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,300
Yes. Yes, it is.

62
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,100
Okay. Well, um, come on in.

63
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,500
So, what, are all the girls in the bathroom?

64
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,800
Probably, but in their own homes.

65
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,300
So, what time does the costume parade start?

66
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
The parade?

67
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,300
Yeah, so the judges can give out the
prizes for best costume.

68
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,200
You know, most frightening,
most authentic, 

69
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,000
most accurate visualization of
a scientific principal.

70
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,200
Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry, 

71
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,600
but there aren't going to be any parades

72
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,100
or judges or prizes.

73
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,100
This party is just going to suck.

74
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,200
No! Come on, it's going to be fun, 

75
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,300
and you all look great.

76
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,900
I mean, look at you, Thor, 

77
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,300
and, oh, Peter Pan.

78
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,600
That's so cute.

79
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,700
- Actually, Penny, he's Robin Hood.
- I'm Peter Pan.

80
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,700
And I got a handful of pixie dust
with your name on it.

81
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,800
No, you don't.

82
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,800
Uh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be?

83
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,100
Oh, he's the Doppler effect.

84
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes. It's the apparent change in
the frequency of a wave

85
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,500
caused by relative motion between
the source of the wave and the observer.

86
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,400
Oh, sure, I see it now.

87
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,600
The Doppler effect.

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,500
All right, I got to shower.

89
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,700
You guys, um, make yourselves comfortable.

90
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,400
Okay.

91
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,100
See?

92
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,600
People get it.

93
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,100
By Odin's beard, this is good Chex mix.

94
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,700
No, thanks. Peanuts.

95
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,800
I can't afford to swell up in these tights.

96
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm confused.

97
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,800
If there's no costume parade,
what are we doing here?

98
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,100
We're socializing, meeting new people.

99
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,700
Telepathically?

100
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,400
Oh, hey, when did you get here?

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Hi.

102
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,200
Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman
costume I've ever seen.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,600
And that includes Halle Berry's.

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,500
She's not Catwoman.
She's just a generic cat.

105
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
And that's the kind of
sloppy costuming

106
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,400
which results from a lack of
rules and competion.

107
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,600
Hey, guys, check out the sexy nurse.

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,900
I believe it's time for me to turn
my head and cough.

109
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,900
What is your move?

110
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,100
I'm going to use the mirror technique.

111
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back...

112
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
She shrugs, I shrug.

113
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,900
Subconsciously she's thinking,
"We're in sync. We belong together."

114
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,300
Where do you get this stuff?

115
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,200
You know, psychology journals,
Internet research, 

116
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
and there's this great show on VH-1
about how to pick up girls.

117
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,900
Oh, if only I had his confidence.

118
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,900
I have such difficulty speaking to
women, or around women...

119
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,000
or at times even effeminate men.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,700
If that's a working stethoscope, 

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,500
maybe you'd like to hear my
heart skip a beat?

122
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,800
No, thanks.

123
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
No, seriously, you can.I have transient
idiopathic arrhythmia.

124
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
I want to get to know Penny's friends, 

125
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,600
I just don't know how to talk to these people.

126
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,800
Well, I actually might be able to help.

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,900
How so?

128
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,400
Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, 

129
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,100
I initially saw their interactions as confusing
and unstructured.

130
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,500
But patterns emerge.

131
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
They have their own language, if you will.

132
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
Go on.

133
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,700
Well, it seems that the newcomer
approaches the existing group
with the greeting, 

134
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,600
"How wasted am I?"

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Which is met with an approving
chorus of "Dude."

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,500
Then what happens?

137
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,200
That's as far as I've gotten.

138
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,000
This is ridiculous.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm jumping in.

140
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,200
Good luck.

141
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,700
No, you're coming with me.

142
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,100
Oh, I hardly think so.

143
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,600
Oh, come on.

144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Aren't you afraid I'll embarrass you?

145
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes; but I need a wing man.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,900
All right, but if we're going to use flight metaphors, 

147
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm much more suited to being the guy

148
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,100
from the FAA analyzing wreckage.

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Hi.

150
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,900
Hi. Hello.

151
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
So what are you supposed to be?

152
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,400
Me? I'll give you a hint.

153
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,200
A choo-choo train?

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Close!

155
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,500
A brain damaged choo-choo train?

156
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,800
How wasted am I?

1
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,800
I still don't get it.

2
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
I'm the Doppler effect.

3
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Okay, if that's some
sort of learning disability, 

4
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
I think it's very insensitive.

5
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,100
Why don't you just tell
people you're a zebra?

6
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,400
Well, why don't you just tell people
you're one of the seven dwarves?

7
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,600
Because I'm Frodo.

8
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,900
Yes, well, I'm the Doppler effect.

9
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,000
- Oh, no.
- What?

10
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,900
That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.

11
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,900
What do you suppose he's doing here?

12
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,500
Besides disrupting the local gravity field.

13
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,900
If he were any bigger, he'd
have moons orbiting him.

14
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,700
Oh, snap.

15
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,200
So, I guess we'll be leaving now.

16
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,100
Why should we leave?

17
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,900
For all we know he crashed the
party and Penny doesn't even want him here.

18
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
You have a backup hypothesis?

19
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Maybe they want to be friends.

20
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,400
Or maybe she wants to be friends
and he wants something more.

21
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Then he and I are on equal ground.

22
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,900
Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.

23
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Look, if this was 1, 500 years ago, 

24
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
by virtue of his size and strength, 

25
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,100
Kurt would be entitled to his choice
of female partners.

26
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,000
And male partners, animal partners, 

27
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
large primordial eggplants--

28
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.

29
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,300
Yes, but our society has
undergone a paradigm shift.

30
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
In the Information Age, Sheldon, 

31
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,800
you and I are the alpha males.

32
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
We shouldn't have to back down.

33
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,500
True.

34
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,700
Why don't you text him that and
see if he backs down?

35
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

36
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm going to assert my
dominance face-to-face.

37
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
Face-to-face? Are you going to
wait for him to sit down, 

38
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,400
or are you going to stand on the coffee table?

39
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,700
Hello, Penny.

40
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,600
Hello, Kurt.

41
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,700
Oh, hey, guys, are you having a good time?

42
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Given the reaction to my costume, 

43
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,500
this party is a scathing indictment of
the American education system.

44
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
What, you're a zebra, right?

45
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,200
Yet another child left behind.

46
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
And what are you supposed to be, an elf?

47
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,200
No, I'm a hobbit.

48
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
What's the difference?

49
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,700
A hobbit is a mortal halfling
inhabitant of Middle Earth, 

50
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,300
whereas an elf is an immortal, tall warrior.

51
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,400
So why the hell would you want to be a hobbit?

52
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Because he's neither tall nor immortal

53
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,000
and none of us could be The Flash.

54
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Well, whatever.

55
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Why don't you go hop off on a quest?

56
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm talking to Penny here.

57
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
I think we're all talking to Penny here.

58
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
I'm not. No offense.

59
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
Okay, maybe you didn't hear me.

60
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
- Go away.
- All right, Kurt, be nice.

61
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,300
Oh, I am being nice.

62
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,000
Right, little buddy?

63
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,200
- Kurt.
- Okay.

64
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,500
I understand your impulse to try to
physically intimidate me.

65
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,100
I mean, you can't compete with
me on an intellectual level

66
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,000
so you're driven to animalistic puffery.

67
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,500
You calling me a puffy animal?

68
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Of course not. No, he's not.

69
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,800
You're not, right, Leonard?

70
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,500
No, I said "animalistic."

71
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,100
Of course we're all animals, 

72
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,600
but some of us have climbed a
little higher on the evolutionary tree.

73
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,900
If he understands that, you're in trouble.

74
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,000
So, what, I'm unevolved?

75
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
You're in trouble.

76
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,500
You know, you use a lot of big words
for such a little dwarf.

77
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,200
Okay, Kurt, please.

78
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,300
Penny, it's okay. I can handle this.

79
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
I am not a dwarf, 

80
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm a hobbit.

81
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,000
A hobbit.

82
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,900
Are misfiring neurons in your
hippocampus preventing the conversion

83
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,400
from short-term to long-term memory?

84
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,000
Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.

85
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,300
A homo habilis discovering his
opposable thumbs says what?

86
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
What?

87
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,200
I think I've made my point.

88
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,600
Yeah? How about I make a point out of
your pointy little head?

89
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,300
Let me remind you, while my
moral support is absolute, 

90
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,500
in a physical confrontation,
I will be less than useless.

91
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,600
There's not going to be a confrontation.

92
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,900
In fact, I doubt if he can even
spell "confrontation."

93
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,700
C- O-N...

94
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,000
frontation!

95
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,900
Kurt, put him down this instant!

96
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
He started it!

97
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,100
I don't care. I'm finishing it.Put him down!

98
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Fine.

99
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,100
You're one lucky little leprechaun.

100
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,100
He's a hobbit!

101
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,400
I got your back.

102
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,900
Leonard, are you okay?

103
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,700
It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us.

105
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,800
It's just getting a little late, so...

106
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, okay.

107
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,100
All right, well, thank you for coming.

108
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Happy Halloween.

109
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,500
If it's any consolation, 

110
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,800
I thought that homo habilis line
really put him in his place.

111
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
What's that?

112
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,300
Tea.

113
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,800
When people are upset, 

114
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,800
the cultural convention is to
bring them hot beverages.

115
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,300
There, there.

116
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,500
You want to talk about it?

117
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,700
- No.
- Good.

118
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,600
"There, there" was really all I had.

119
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,100
Good night, Sheldon.

120
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Good night, Leonard.

121
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Hey, Leonard?

122
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,800
Hi, Penny.

123
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Hey, I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

124
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,400
I'm fine.

125
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,700
I am so sorry about what happened.

126
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,500
It's not your fault.

127
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,700
Yes, it is.

128
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,100
That's why I broke up with him.

129
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,300
He always does stuff like that.

130
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,600
So why was he at your party?

131
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,400
Well, I ran into him last week and he
was just all apologetic about how he's changed.

132
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
And he was just going on and on and...

133
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,400
I believed him and I'm an idiot

134
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
because I always believe guys like that.

135
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,800
And I can't go back to my party
because he's there.

136
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,500
And know you don't want to
hear this and I'm upset

137
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,200
and I'm really drunk and I just want to...

138
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,000
There, there.

139
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,400
God, what is wrong with me?

140
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,000
Nothing, you're perfect.

141
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,600
I'm not perfect.

142
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes, you are.

143
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,300
You really think so, don't you?

144
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,200
Penny?

145
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,300
Yeah?

146
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,800
How much have you had to drink tonight?

147
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,800
Just... a lot.

148
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,200
Are you sure that your being drunk
and your being angry with Kurt

149
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,200
doesn't have something to do
with what's going on here?

150
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,600
It might.

151
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,700
Boy, you're really smart.

152
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah, I'm a frickin' genius.

153
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Leonard, you are so great.

154
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why can't all guys be like you?

155
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,500
Because if all guys were like me, 

156
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,200
the human race couldn't survive.

157
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,100
I should probably go.

158
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,700
Probably.

159
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,000
Thank you.

160
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,700
That's right, you saw what you saw.

161
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,400
That's how we roll in the Shire.

1
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
Coming.

2
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey, have you seen Koothrappali?

3
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,700
He's not here.

4
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,400
Maybe the Avengers summoned him.

5
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
He's not the Marvel Comics Thor,
he's the original Norse god.

6
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,100
Thank you for the clarification.

7
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,400
I'm supposed to give him a ride home.

8
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,000
Well, I'm sure he'll be fine.

9
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,400
He has his hammer.

10
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,800
I have to say, you are an amazing man.

11
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,300
You're gentle, and passionate.

12
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,200
And, my God, you are such a good listener.
