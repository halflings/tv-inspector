1
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:06,054
No, see, the liquid-metal terminators
were created in the future by Skynet...

2
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:08,281
...and Skynet was developed
by Miles Dyson...

3
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,417
<i>...but that future no longer exists
due to Dyson's death in Terminator 2.</i>

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,155
Okay, then riddle me this.

5
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:16,992
Assuming all the good terminators...

6
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,795
...were originally evil terminators
created by Skynet...

7
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:23,029
...then reprogrammed by the future
John Connor, why would Skynet...

8
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:25,106
...an artificial computer intelligence...

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:29,473
...bother to create
a petite, hot, 17-year-old killer robot?

10
00:00:31,347 --> 00:00:33,440
Skynet is kinky? I don't know.

11
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:37,978
Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

12
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:41,180
- All right, wait. They use it to lure...
- Eh! Too late, I win.

13
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:58,841
What the hell is that?

14
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,940
I don't know. But if cats could sing...

15
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,808
...they'd hate it too.

16
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,783
Hey, guys.

17
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,154
- Hi, where are you going?
- What?

18
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,729
We just had to mail some letters.

19
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:25,061
And throw away some chicken.

20
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,352
You'll never guess what just happened.

21
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,988
- I give up.
- I don't guess.

22
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:49,751
As a scientist, I reach conclusions
based on observation and experimentation.

23
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:54,219
Although it occurs to me, you may
have been employing a rhetorical device...

24
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:56,262
...rendering my response moot.

25
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,497
- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth.

26
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,694
What happened?

27
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,001
<i>Remember when I auditioned for Rent but
I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?</i>

28
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,167
I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

29
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:09,368
No, you don't.

30
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,843
No, he doesn't.

31
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:14,910
The girl picked to play Mimi, she dropped
out and they asked me to replace her.

32
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,882
- Oh! Congratulations, what a lucky break.
- It's not a big a deal.

33
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,818
Just one night,
but they invite casting people and agents.

34
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,014
So you never know.

35
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:24,626
- I think I know.
- No, you don't.

36
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:28,255
- He doesn't.
- It's this Friday at 8, you guys wanna come?

37
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,591
- No.
- No.

38
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:36,136
Because Friday,
we are attending a symposium...

39
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:37,898
...on molecular positronium.

40
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,202
- I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6.
- No, it's this Friday.

41
00:02:41,778 --> 00:02:44,508
- At 8.
- Oh, too bad.

42
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:46,945
- I gotta get to rehearsal. See you guys.
- See you.

43
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,016
- You just lied to Penny.
- Yes, I did.

44
00:02:55,191 --> 00:02:56,522
And you did it so casually.

45
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:59,628
No rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration.

46
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:02,026
- So?
- So lack of a physiological response...

47
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:05,998
...while lying
is characteristic of a violent sociopath.

48
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,467
Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

49
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:12,768
No. I imagine if you were going to kill me,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

50
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,370
That's very true.

51
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:03,119
Leonard?

52
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:04,555
Leonard?

53
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,752
- Leonard?
What?

54
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,462
I need to speak to you.

55
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,965
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- It's important.

56
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,730
I highly doubt that.

57
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:17,896
Go away.

58
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,839
Are you still out there?

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,038
Yes.

60
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,477
What?

61
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,844
You're right, it can wait until morning.

62
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:37,086
What, what, what?
- Never mind.

63
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,785
I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

64
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:43,364
- You're in no state of mind to talk.
- Sheldon, what is it?

65
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:48,028
I'm uncomfortable
having been included in your lie to Penny.

66
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:51,835
- What was I supposed to say?
- You could have told her the truth.

67
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:53,635
That would have hurt her feelings.

68
00:04:54,444 --> 00:04:56,708
Is that a relevant factor?

69
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,107
Yes.

70
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,306
Then I suppose
you could have agreed to go.

71
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:02,974
And what would I have said afterwards?

72
00:05:03,152 --> 00:05:05,211
I would suggest something
to the effect of:

73
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,789
"Singing is neither an appropriate vocation
nor avocation for you...

74
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,155
...and if you disagree, I recommend
a CAT scan to look for a tumor...

75
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:15,855
...pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain. "

76
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,258
I couldn't say that.

77
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:22,734
I would have to say, "You were terrific
and I can't wait to hear you sing again. "

78
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,068
Why?

79
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,038
It's the social protocol.

80
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,234
It's what you do...

81
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,812
...when you have a friend who's proud
of something they really suck at.

82
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,248
I was not aware of that.

83
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,011
- Well, now you are.
- Oh, all right.

84
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:38,676
- Leonard?
- Yes?

85
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:42,723
When we played chess earlier, you were
terrific, and I can't wait to play you again.

86
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,416
Good night.

87
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:50,490
Leonard? Leonard?

88
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:53,032
Leonard? Leonard?

89
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:56,399
This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

90
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:59,006
Leonard? Leonard?

91
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,541
- What?
- I was analyzing our lie...

92
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:05,772
...and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

93
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:08,149
- How?
- Simple.

94
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:13,482
If she were to log on to www.
Socalphysicsgroup. Org/activities/other...

95
00:06:13,656 --> 00:06:17,217
...click on upcoming events, scroll to
seminars, download the PDF schedule...

96
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:20,191
...and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium, then...

97
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:24,060
...bippity boppity boo,
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

98
00:06:28,738 --> 00:06:32,105
Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

99
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,804
Penny?

100
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,206
Penny?

101
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,972
Penny?

102
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:40,675
Good morning.

103
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,580
- Do you have any idea what time it is?
- Of course I do.

104
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:47,519
My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

105
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,158
It's accurate to one-tenth of a second.

106
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,521
As I'm saying this
it occurs to me once again...

107
00:06:52,695 --> 00:06:55,255
...your question may
have been rhetorical.

108
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,892
What do you want?

109
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:59,330
Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come...

110
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,994
...because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

111
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,404
I remember symposium.

112
00:07:08,277 --> 00:07:10,507
Yes, well, he lied.

113
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,772
Wait, what?

114
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,214
He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

115
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,444
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

116
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,186
Hungry?

117
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,489
Tired?

118
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,356
I'm sorry, this really isn't my strong suit.

119
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,395
You told her I lied?

120
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,430
Why would you tell her I lied?

121
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,935
To help you.

122
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,397
I'm sorry, I'm not seeing the help.

123
00:07:36,572 --> 00:07:38,904
She was going to see
through your lie eventually...

124
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:41,543
...so I told her that you were lying
to protect me.

125
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,539
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling.

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,410
Hunger?

127
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,275
Indigestion?

128
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:51,545
I'm sorry,
I'm really not very good at this.

129
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:54,684
Anyway, Penny now believes
that on Friday night...

130
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:59,521
...we're going to participate
in my cousin Leopold's drug intervention.

131
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:01,690
Your cousin Leopold.

132
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:04,389
Whom most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

133
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,000
Remember that, it's important.

134
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,528
- What's important?
- Details, Leonard.

135
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:12,868
The success or failure
of our deceitful enterprise turns on details.

136
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:16,569
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No, I made him up.

137
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,748
I think you'd call him Lee.

138
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:24,582
I don't get it. I already told her a lie,
why replace it with a different lie?

139
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,552
Well, first of all,
your lie was laughably transparent...

140
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:30,157
...where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

141
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,854
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

142
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:38,432
- Un-unravelable?
- Yes.

143
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,536
If she Googles Leopold Houston,
she'll find a Facebook page...

144
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,264
...an online blog
depicting his descent into drug use...

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,137
...and a desperate
yet hopeful listing on eHarmony. Com.

146
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:52,845
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

147
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,212
Ah! Because it's in Long Beach
and I don't drive.

148
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,814
We're going to Long Beach?

149
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:01,855
Of course not, there's no cousin Leo,
there's no intervention.

150
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,618
- Focus, Leonard.
- Oh, come on.

151
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,793
We just leave the house on Friday night
and return in the wee hours...

152
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,731
...emotionally wrung out from the work
of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.

153
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,392
So he goes back into rehab?

154
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,803
Yes, but he can relapse if Penny
ever invites us to hear her sing again.

155
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,877
You still told her I lied.

156
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,307
Yeah, for a noble purpose.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,246
To spare me the social embarrassment
of having a drug-addled first cousin.

158
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:31,147
- Which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?
- I don't know.

159
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:36,488
- How am I supposed to remember all this?
- That's the best part, you don't have to.

160
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,652
I told Penny that you would be embarrassed
if you knew she found out you had lied...

161
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,732
...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

162
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:52,340
So she's expecting me to lie
about going to a symposium in Pasadena...

163
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:57,502
...when in actuality, we're pretending to go
to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

164
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,504
Un-unravelable.

165
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,383
Oh, hey, Penny. Wow, look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

166
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:09,045
- You look great.
Thanks.

167
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:13,387
I just wanted to come by and wish you
guys luck with your symposium.

168
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,458
Oh.

169
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,063
- Well, thank you.
- You know, I gotta tell you.

170
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,429
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone, but that's not you.

171
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:25,333
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when...

172
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,407
When he has a symposium to go to.

173
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:33,809
I don't know what to say.

174
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:37,882
- It's okay, Leonard.
- Oh, okay, all right, good.

175
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,209
- Oh, boy, group hug.
- Uh-uh.

176
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:44,346
- Uh-uh?
- Okay. So, what's up?

177
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:48,655
<i>Well, Penny is on her way to perform in
a one-night showcase production of Rent...</i>

178
00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,094
...which we are unable to attend,
because we're going to a symposium...

179
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:56,635
...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

180
00:10:56,804 --> 00:11:01,298
Wait a minute, Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

181
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:04,978
- Howard, I'm sorry, we would've...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

182
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,476
I don't know what to say.

183
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:11,041
Wow.

184
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,186
<i>- Howard...
- It's your Millennium Falcon...</i>

185
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:16,187
...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

186
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:21,018
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

187
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:22,822
Howard, wait.

188
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:26,057
Sheldon, I think we should tell them.

189
00:11:27,234 --> 00:11:28,565
Okay, sure.

190
00:11:28,736 --> 00:11:30,294
I don't see a problem with that.

191
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,630
There's no symposium.

192
00:11:33,807 --> 00:11:35,900
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

193
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:37,566
Well...

194
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,737
- I don't know what to say.
- It's okay, I do.

195
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:44,544
Look, Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

196
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:49,348
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian...

197
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:50,581
- Good for you.
- Ha! Yeah.

198
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:56,161
He didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

199
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,264
Every family in America has a relative...

200
00:11:58,432 --> 00:12:01,560
...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

201
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,170
No, I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

202
00:12:05,973 --> 00:12:10,376
Now, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped
rehab and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

203
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:12,808
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

204
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,676
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

205
00:12:15,849 --> 00:12:19,683
...because he's such a good man.
- Oh, another hug? Thank you.

206
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,646
- All right, you guys. Good luck.
- Thanks, Penny.

207
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,553
- Break a leg.
- Yeah, break a leg.

208
00:12:27,127 --> 00:12:28,526
So road trip to Long Beach.

209
00:12:28,696 --> 00:12:31,062
- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

210
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,291
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

211
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:36,231
Oh, too bad.

212
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,235
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

213
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:42,204
<i>It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.</i>

214
00:12:42,376 --> 00:12:45,743
Once the largest liner in the world,
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

215
00:12:45,913 --> 00:12:48,939
...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

216
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,874
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

217
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:53,281
- Shotgun.
- No, no, no.

218
00:12:53,988 --> 00:12:57,389
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.

219
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:02,618
Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?

220
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,337
Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

221
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:14,167
Let it go, Sheldon.

222
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:17,640
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

223
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:20,777
No, that's the least of our worries.

224
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,779
I've been doing research on addiction...

225
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,111
...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

226
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:28,516
...and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

227
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:31,658
What are you talking about?
It's fine, she bought it, it's over.

228
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:37,757
Sadly, it's not.

229
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:39,831
Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,525
But beyond that,
I have realized the Leo I described...

231
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:46,434
...would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

232
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,040
Because Leo's a middle child.

233
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:52,108
There's no Leo. How can you say that?

234
00:13:55,349 --> 00:13:57,840
You didn't read the bio, did you?

235
00:13:58,018 --> 00:14:01,078
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child.

236
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:03,951
From a broken home, to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

237
00:14:04,124 --> 00:14:07,560
...the attention he gets by rebelling,
even to the point of destruction...

238
00:14:07,728 --> 00:14:10,697
...is more emotionally valuable
than help he would get at rehab.

239
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:12,729
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

240
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,198
Get out.

241
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,537
Fine.

242
00:14:23,444 --> 00:14:25,071
I've hesitated to point this out...

243
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:27,679
...but I must remind you
we are in our predicament...

244
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:30,146
...because of your initial
and inadequate deceit.

245
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:32,376
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

246
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,624
We'll talk in the morning.

247
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,766
Morning.

248
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,705
Who are you?

249
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:57,101
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

250
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:59,677
Oh, God.

251
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,717
Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.

252
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,614
Au contraire.

253
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:08,049
I'm 26 years old...

254
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:13,558
...I'm originally from "Denton, Texas,"
but I was a Navy brat.

255
00:15:13,727 --> 00:15:16,719
I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

256
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:20,333
As a result, I've often felt like an outsider,
never really fitting in...

257
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:22,969
...probably the reason
for my substance-abuse problem.

258
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:26,106
Excuse me, we just went over this.

259
00:15:26,273 --> 00:15:30,710
As the middle child, your addiction
is rooted in your unmet need for attention.

260
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:33,642
Oh, Sheldon, are we really gonna go
with pop psychology?

261
00:15:33,814 --> 00:15:36,647
For your information,
this is all based on solid research.

262
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:39,377
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

263
00:15:39,553 --> 00:15:41,145
- Sheldon?
- I'm sorry.

264
00:15:41,321 --> 00:15:42,879
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

265
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:45,786
He's a research assistant
in the particle-physics lab...

266
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,087
...but he also minored in theater at MIT.

267
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:51,128
It was more of a double major, actually.

268
00:15:51,498 --> 00:15:52,522
Theater and Physics.

269
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,600
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.

270
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:56,963
Yeah, I got it.

271
00:15:57,137 --> 00:15:59,071
Sheldon, why?

272
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,799
You see, while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...

273
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:05,968
...it is completely plausible that we would
have talked him into leaving the motel...

274
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:08,307
...and coming home with us.
- Oh...

275
00:16:08,582 --> 00:16:10,607
Sheldon, how about this
as my motivation?

276
00:16:10,784 --> 00:16:11,978
When I was 14 years old...

277
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:16,179
...I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

278
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:21,125
No, we're going with middle child
and a genetic predisposition...

279
00:16:21,295 --> 00:16:23,820
...to inadequate serotonin production.

280
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:26,761
Swell, well, how do I play
genetic predisposition?

281
00:16:27,935 --> 00:16:30,096
Subtextually, of course.

282
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,335
Just have fun with it.

283
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,705
- Morning, Penny.
- Hi. How did the intervention go?

284
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:45,784
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

285
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:49,150
Well, based on what you told me,
I'm not surprised.

286
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,150
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

287
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,352
Come say hello.

288
00:16:57,097 --> 00:17:01,466
Leo, this is Penny,
our friend and neighbor.

289
00:17:01,635 --> 00:17:04,832
Hi, Leo, how are you feeling?

290
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,667
Let me ask you something, Penny.

291
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:16,378
Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel
covered in your own vomit...

292
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,314
...next to a transsexual prostitute?

293
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:26,386
- No.
- Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.

294
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:29,919
Well, that's Leo.

295
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:34,363
Hey, why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night?

296
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:35,728
Oh, it was okay, I guess.

297
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:38,427
Wasn't a big turnout,
but they both seemed to like it.

298
00:17:39,106 --> 00:17:43,406
- There were only two people there?
- By the end, yeah.

299
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:46,374
Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan.

300
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,781
I'm sorry?

301
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,918
The Philippines.

302
00:17:53,687 --> 00:17:55,814
1992.

303
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,889
The Subic Bay Naval Station.

304
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:01,050
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

305
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:06,630
His only companions,
mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitoes.

306
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,133
Desperate and alone,
he reached out to a man...

307
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:14,400
...who promised to introduce him
to a merciful, loving God...

308
00:18:14,574 --> 00:18:18,738
...but who instead introduced him
to a gin-pickled tongue...

309
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:22,780
...shoved down his adolescent throat.

310
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,249
What choice did he have...

311
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:31,255
...but to drink, shoot
and snort his pain away?

312
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,893
Don't forget genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

313
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:35,085
Never been proven.

314
00:18:35,262 --> 00:18:37,662
- There have been studies.
- Not double-blind studies.

315
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:40,299
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

316
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,526
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

317
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:44,796
- Let's give them some privacy.
- Yeah.

318
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,734
Do you wanna come over,
have coffee?

319
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:49,933
- Sounds good.
- I have a video of me singing last night.

320
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,941
Do you wanna see it?

321
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:54,739
- Gee, why wouldn't I?
- This is even better...

322
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:58,078
...than you coming to the showcase,
now I get to watch you watch me.

323
00:18:58,251 --> 00:18:59,582
Yeah.

324
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,384
Funny how things work out.

325
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,152
But he loved the companionship
and the wisdom...

326
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:08,794
...that his own father failed to provide.

327
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,694
Your parents made the right decision.

328
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:20,233
I cannot work like this.

329
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:35,180
This is amazing, just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

330
00:19:35,355 --> 00:19:40,793
Not being drunk or high
or wondering if you're a dude down there.

331
00:19:42,596 --> 00:19:46,123
Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

332
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,426
You're gonna do okay.

333
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,927
One day at a time, Penny.

334
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:56,769
One day at a time.

335
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,943
How long is he going to stay here?

336
00:20:04,117 --> 00:20:07,848
He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard,
where is he going to go?

337
00:20:08,088 --> 00:20:10,784
Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.
