1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,500
You know, I've been thinking
about timetravel again.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,300
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,100
Put it on a backburner.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,500
Anyway.
It occurs to me,

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,400
If I have ever did
perfect time machine,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,600
I'd just go into the past
and give it to myself.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,100
That's eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Interesting.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,400
Yeah, it really kicks the pressure off.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,600
Sounds like a breakthrough.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,100
Should I call Science Magazine
and tell them to hold the cover?

12
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,600
It's time travel,
I will have already done that.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,500
Then I guess congratulations
are in order.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,600
No, congratulations will
have been in order.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You know, I am not going
to enjoy this party.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,900
I know,
I'm familiar with you.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,200
The last department party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,600
and talked about
spelunking for 45 minutes.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,900
Yes, I was there.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,900
You know what's interesting
about caves?

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,400
- What?
- Nothing.

22
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,900
Then we'll avoid him,
we'll meet the new department head,

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,700
congratulate him,
shake his hand and go.

24
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,600
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,600
"How fortunate for you
that the university's

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
"chosen to hire you,
despite the fact

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,700
"that you've done no original
research in 25 years,

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
"and instead have written
a series of popular books

29
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,800
"that reduce
the great concepts of science

30
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,200
"to a series of anecdotes,

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,600
"each one dumbed down
to accommodate the duration

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,600
"of an average bowel movement.

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Mahalo."

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
"Mahalo's" a nice touch.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,300
You know there only eight consonants
in Hawaiian language?

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,500
Interesting.
You should lead with that.

37
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,100
Oh, God, look at this buffet.

38
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,100
I love America.

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,000
You don't have buffets in India?

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,500
Of course,
but it's all Indian food.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,900
You can't find a bagel
in Mumbai to save your life.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Shmear me.

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,400
- Here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,100
Howard brought a date?

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,700
A more plausible explanation is that

46
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
his work in robotics has made

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
an amazing leap forward.

48
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Hey, what up,
science bitches?

49
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,300
May I introduce my

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
special lady friend Summer?

51
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,900
- I told you touching's extra.
- Right. Sorry.

52
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
Here comes our new boss.
Be polite.

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,900
Hi, fellas.
Eric Gablehauser.

54
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,200
Howard Wolowitz.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,600
Nice to meet you.
And you are?

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,500
An actualrealscientist.

57
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
How was that?

58
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't believe he fired me.

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,500
Well, you did call him
a glorified high school science teacher

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,800
whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
In my defense,

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,000
I prefaced that by saying,
"With all due respect."

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Season 1 Episode 4:
The Luminous Fish Effect

64
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Morning.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Morning.

66
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
You're making eggs for breakfast?

67
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,100
This isn't breakfast,
it's an experiment.

68
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
'Cause it looks a lot like breakfast.

69
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
I finally have time
to test my hypothesis

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,600
about the separation
of the water molecules

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,700
from the egg proteins and its
impact vis-a-vis taste.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Sounds yummy.

73
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
I look forward
to your work with bacon.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As do I.

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,800
You know, I'm sure
if you just apologize

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to Gablehauser,
he would give you your job back.

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,400
I don't want my job back.

78
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,700
I've spent the past
three and a half years

79
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,700
staring at grease boards
full of equations.

80
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,300
Before that, I spent four years
working on my thesis.

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,900
Before that, I was in college,

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and before that,
I was in the fifth grade.

83
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,000
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,300
Not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,700
And we all thank you.

87
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,100
Use new eggs.

88
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
I'm running out to the market.
You need anything?

89
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
This would be
one of those circumstances

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,200
that people unfamiliar with the law of
large numbers would call a coincidence.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,300
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

92
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,900
Four dozen should suffice.

93
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,300
- Four dozen?
- Yes,

94
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
and evenly distributed
amongst brown, white,

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
free-range, large,
extra large and jumbo.

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Okay, one more time.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Never mind.
You won't get it right.

98
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,900
I'd better come with you.

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,900
How come you didn't
go into work today?

100
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm taking a sabbatical

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,000
because I won't kowtow
to mediocre minds.

102
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,300
So you got canned, huh?

103
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,400
Theoretical physicists
do not get canned...

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
but yeah.

105
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,200
Maybe it's all for the best.

106
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,000
I always say when one door closes,
another one opens.

107
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,000
No, it doesn't.

108
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,200
Not unless the two doors
are connected by relays

109
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
- or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
Or if the first door closing
creates a change of air pressure

111
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
that acts upon the second door.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Never mind.

113
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,300
Slow down.

114
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,800
- Please, slow down!
- We're fine!

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
You're not leaving yourself
enough space between cars.

116
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,100
- Oh, sure, I am.
- No, let me do the math for you.

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,700
This car weighs,
let's say 4,000 pounds.

118
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
Now add 140 for me,
120 for you...

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,300
120?

120
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm sorry. Did I insult you?

121
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,900
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

122
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,800
Well, yeah.

123
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Interesting.

124
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,600
Anyway, that gives us
a total weight of,

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,300
let's say 4,400 pounds.

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,800
Let's say 4,390.

127
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,500
Fine. We're traveling forward at--

128
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,400
good Lord-- 51 miles an hour.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Let's assume that your brakes

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
are new
and the calipers are aligned.

131
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
Still, by the time we come
to a stop,

132
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,700
we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick in front of us,

133
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,300
an impossibility that
nature will quickly resolve

134
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,800
into death, mutilation...

135
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,200
Oh, look, they built
a new putt-putt course.

136
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,100
This is great.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
Look at me.

138
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm in the real world
of ordinary people

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,100
just living their ordinary,
colorless workaday lives.

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Thank you.

141
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,400
No, thankyou.

142
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,200
And thank you, ordinary person.

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
You want to hear
an interesting thing about tomatoes?

144
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,200
No, not really.

145
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,100
Listen, didn't you say
you need some eggs?

146
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about the dynamics of bacterial growth

147
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,800
knows to pick up their refrigerated food
on the way out of the supermarket.

148
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,800
Okay, then maybe you should start
heading on out then.

149
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
No, this is fun.

150
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, the thing about tomatoes--
and I think you'll really enjoy this--

151
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,700
is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

152
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,200
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

153
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
No, I mean
what you find enjoyable.

154
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
Oh, boy.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What now?

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin,

157
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,700
but the human body
can only absorb so much.

158
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
What you're buying here

159
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,000
are the ingredients
for very expensive urine.

160
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,200
Well, maybe that's what
I was going for.

161
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
Then you'll want some manganese.

162
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,700
That was fun.

163
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,400
Maybe tomorrow we can go
to one of those big warehouse stores.

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,700
Oh, I don't know.

165
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,600
It's going to take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

166
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Are you sure?

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
There are a lot of advantages
to buying in bulk.

168
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,400
For example, I noticed
that you purchase your tampons

169
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
one-month supply at a time.

170
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
What?

171
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Think about it.
It's a product that doesn't spoil

172
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,100
You want me to buy 30 years
worth of tampons?

174
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,500
Well, 30, 35.
When did your mother go into menopause?

175
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm not talking
about this with you.

176
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
This is a natural human process,

177
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
and we're talking about
statistically significant savings.

178
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,500
Now, if you assume 15 tampons
per cycle and a 28-day cycle...

179
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,100
Are you fairly regular?

180
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,600
Okay, no warehouse store,

181
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,800
but we're still on
for putt-putt golf, right?

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,700
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

183
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,200
I think it's her time of the month.

184
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

185
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,900
What's with the fish?

186
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,400
It's an experiment.

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,700
What happened
to your scrambled egg research?

188
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,100
Oh, that was a dead end.

189
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,100
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

190
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,800
So... fish?

191
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I read an article
about Japanese scientists

192
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,300
who inserted DNA from luminous
jellyfish into other animals,

193
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,600
and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,500
Fish nightlights?

195
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,500
It's a billion-dollar idea.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Mum's the word.

197
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,200
Are you sure you don't want

198
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,800
to just apologize to Gablehauser
and get your job back?

199
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,300
No, I have too much to do.

200
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,900
Like luminous fish.

201
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,300
I'm sorry.
I didn't...

202
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,500
That's just the beginning.

203
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
I also have an idea

204
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,900
for a bulk mail-order
feminine hygiene company.

205
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,100
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons!

206
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,300
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,300
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

208
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,100
- You did the right thing calling.
- I didn't know what else to do.

209
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,400
He's lost all focus.
Every day he's got a new obsession.

210
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,800
This is a particularly disturbing one.

211
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Mommy?

212
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,600
Hi, baby!

1
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Oh, you got yourself a loom?
How nice!

2
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
Thank you.

3
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,000
Honey, why'd you get a loom?

4
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,200
I was working with luminous fish,
and I thought...

5
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
"loom."

6
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Mom, what are you doing here?

7
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,800
Leonard called me.

8
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
I know, but why?

9
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,700
Because one of the great minds
of the 21st century

10
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,100
is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

11
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,400
This is not a serape,
this is a poncho.

12
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,700
A serape is open at the sides;
a poncho is closed.

13
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
This is a poncho.

14
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,700
And neither is a reason
to call someone'smother.

15
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,700
Really? When was the last time
you left the house?

16
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
I went to the market with Penny.

17
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,700
That was three weeks ago.

18
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,500
Well, then buckle up.
In the next four to eight days

19
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,500
she's going to get very crabby.

20
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,900
Sweetheart, your little friend
is concerned about you.

21
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Yes, well, I'm not a child--
I'm a grown man,

22
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,500
capable of living my life as I see fit.

23
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,700
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother!

24
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,400
Wait, where are you going?

25
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,900
To my room.
And no one's allowed in!

26
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,100
He gets his temper
from his daddy.

27
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,300
He's got my eyes.

28
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,600
I see.

29
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,600
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

30
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,100
- Sheldon, your mom made dinner.
- I'm not hungry!

31
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

32
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,300
He may stay in there till the Rapture.

33
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,900
We so sure that's abadthing?

34
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,100
I tell you,
I love the boy to death,

35
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,600
but he has been difficult since
he fell out of me at the K-Mart.

36
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,700
Excuse me for being so bold,

37
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,300
but I now see where Sheldon
gets his smoldering good looks.

38
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,500
Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep tryin'.

39
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
I made chicken.

40
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,900
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

41
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,500
You know, we have an Indian
gentleman at our church,

42
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,000
a Dr. Patel--
It's a beautiful story.

43
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,700
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20% off on Lasik--

44
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,400
You know, those that needed it.

45
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,700
That is a lovely story.

46
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,900
Are we gonna do anything about Sheldon?

47
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,500
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

48
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,200
His father, God rest his soul,
used to always say to me,

49
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,100
"Mary, you have to take
your time with Sheldon."

50
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,200
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

51
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

52
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
So, everybody
grab a plate

53
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,200
and a pretty place mat
that Shelly wove.

54
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,000
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

55
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,400
Oh, all the time.

56
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
I remember one summer
when he was 13,

57
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,700
he built a small nuclear
reactor in the shed

58
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,600
and told everybody he was gonna provide
free electricity for the whole town.

59
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,100
Well, the only problem was,

60
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,700
he had no what you call
"fissionable" materials.

61
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,700
Anyway, when he went on the Internets
to get some,

62
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,400
a man from the government
came by and sat him down

63
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,100
real gentle, and told him
it's against the law

64
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
to have yellow-cake uranium
in a shed.

65
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,900
- What happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

66
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,000
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

67
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
A death ray?

68
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,600
That's what he called it.
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.

69
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,100
It pissed our dog off to no end.

70
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,500
You know, you two
make a cute couple.

71
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
No. We're not...
we're not-not a couple.

72
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,600
We're singles. Two singles.

73
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,100
Like those... individuly wrapped
slices of cheese that...

74
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,700
We're friends.

75
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,400
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

76
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,700
All right, everybody,
it's time to eat.

77
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,500
Oh, Lord,
we thank You for this meal

78
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,300
and all of Your bounty.

79
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,800
And we pray that You help Sheldon

80
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
get back on his rocker.

81
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,000
Now, after a moment
of silent meditation,

82
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,200
I'm gonna end with
"In Jesus' name,"

83
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,600
but you two don't feel
any obligation to join in.

84
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,800
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

85
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Oh, my God, this is the
best cobbler I've ever had.

86
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,200
It was always Sheldon's favorite.

87
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
You know what
the secret ingredient is?

88
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
- Love?
- Lard.

89
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,800
Hey, look who's come...

90
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,500
You'll spook him.

91
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,400
He's like a baby deer.
You got to let him come to you.

92
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,900
This is ridiculous.
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it!

93
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
You're a physicist--

94
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,200
You belong at the university
doing research, not hiding in your room!

95
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,100
You don't hunt, do you?

96
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,800
Good morning, snickerdoodle.

97
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,300
Morning.

98
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

99
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
It's my idea
of what DNA would look like

100
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,600
in a silicon-based life-form.

101
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,000
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

102
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
What do you want, Mom?

103
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,200
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long

104
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,000
before you got to throw a
stick of dynamite in the water?

105
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,300
Well, I'm done fishing.

106
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
You put those on.

107
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,900
- What for?
- Because you're gonna

108
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,100
go down to your office,
you're gonna apologize

109
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,800
to your boss
and get your job back.

110
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,400
No.
I'm sorry,

111
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,400
did I start that sentence
with the words,

112
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,300
"If it please Your Highness"?

113
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm not going to apologize--
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

114
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
Now, you listen here.

115
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,500
I have been telling you
since you were four years old,

116
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,600
it's okay to be smarter
than everybody,

117
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,400
but you can't go around
pointing it out.

118
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,300
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it!

119
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,600
Remember all the ass-kickings
you got from the neighbor kids?

120
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,300
Now, let's get crackin'.

121
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,300
Shower, shirt, shoes,
and let's shove off.

122
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,700
There wouldn't have been
any ass-kickings

123
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
if that stupid death ray
had worked.

124
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,700
Problem solved.

125
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,000
Really? That's impressive.

126
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,200
Leonard, the Lord never gives
us more than we can handle.

127
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,000
Thankfully, He blessed me
with two other children

128
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,300
who are dumb as soup.

129
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

130
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodlin'.

131
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,800
Get in here.

132
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,300
Let's go, baby.
We're losing daylight.

133
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,900
As you know,

134
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,800
several weeks ago
in our first encounter,

135
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot

136
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,900
when I called you an idiot.

137
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,600
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

138
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,400
to point it out.

139
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,500
I'm sorry,
we haven't been introduced.

140
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,000
Sheldon's mom.

141
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Now, that's impossible! You must
have had him when you were a teenager.

142
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,900
Oh, aren't you sweet.
His father's dead.

143
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,600
- Recently?
- Long enough.

144
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Please.

145
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

146
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,100
Hey, how did it go?

147
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,100
I got my job back.

148
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,700
Really?
What happened?

149
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm not quite sure.

150
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,200
It involves a part
of the human experience

151
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,100
that has always eluded me.

152
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,700
That narrows it down.

1
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm very proud of you honey.

2
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,800
You showed a lot of courage today.

3
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Thanks, Mom.

4
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,100
Is Dr. Gablehauser going
to be my new daddy?

5
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
We'll see.

6
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Sleep tight.
