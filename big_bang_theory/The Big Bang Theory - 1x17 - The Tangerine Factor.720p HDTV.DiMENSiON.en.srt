1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,900
<i>Wo de zing shi</i> Sheldon.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,300
Non, c'est...

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,600
<i>Wo de ming zi shi</i> Sheldon.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
<i>Wo de ming zi shi</i> Sheldon.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What's this?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,200
That's what you did.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,100
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Well, it's not.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,900
How am I supposed to know that?
As the teacher, it's your obligation

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies
from the subject matter.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,000
You know, I'm really glad
you decided to learn Mandarin.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,600
- Why?
- Once you're fluent,

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,500
you'll have a billion more people
to annoy instead of me.

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>Mei du lui zi.</i>

15
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,400
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,300
My apologies,

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,400
I'm only as good as my teacher.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Why are you learning Chinese?

19
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,600
I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,100
orange chicken as tangerine chicken
and I intend to confront them.

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,300
If I were you, I'd be more concerned

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
about what they are passing off
as chicken.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,100
- I need to use your window.
- Sure, go ahead.

24
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,700
Hey, jerk face, you forgot your iPod!

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,000
That stupid self-centered bastar
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,300
Drop dead,
you stupid self-centered bastard!

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Thank you.

29
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,800
Okay, where were we?

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Not now, I have a blog to find.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,200
Episode 117: The Tangerine Factor

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
Penny, are you okay?

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away!

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,400
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,600
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better! Bye!

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,100
She doesn't want to talk.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,400
Not surprising.
Penny's emotional response is originated

39
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,200
in the primitive portion of the brain,
known as the amygdala.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,200
While speech is centered in the much
more recently developed neo-cortex.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,300
The former can easily
overpower the latter,

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,500
giving scientific credence to the notion
of being "rendered speechless."

43
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,800
Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.

44
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,300
Look, I found an iPod!

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,100
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

46
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
What else?
Sell it on eBay as "slightly used."

47
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,600
It was Penny's boyfriend's,
they broke up.

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship

49
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,400
on his blog
which I cannot find anywhere.

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,600
I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,400
Good idea, sit with her.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,900
Hold her, comfort her.

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,700
And if the moment feels right,

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,700
see if you can cop a feel.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm not aware of a new social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
What about damsel in distress?

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,000
Twelfth century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,300
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

60
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,900
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,900
Remember to sit on your hands a bit,
so they're warm.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,700
So you're saying,
if in the depths of despair,

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,300
she throws herself at you
and demands you take her,

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,900
right there, right now,
you'll just walk away?

66
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,900
I said I'm her friend,
not her gay friend.

67
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,500
Listen, I know you said
you didn't want to talk...

68
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
- I don't.
- Sorry.

69
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,800
- Wait!
- Wait? Did you say "wait"?

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,400
Tell me the truth.

71
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,900
Am I just an idiot
who picks giant losers?

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,200
So I pick good guys
but turn them into losers.

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,900
- Of course not.
- Well,

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,600
it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

75
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,800
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
I really thought Mike was different.

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,500
I thought he was...

78
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,400
sensitive and smart,

79
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,600
I mean, not <i>you</i> smart,
normal non-freaky smart.

80
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,400
Yeah, no, sure.

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,900
And then he just goes
and has to humiliate me

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,500
by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,100
I tell you, it's not all
that easy to find.

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,600
Really? My friends at work found it,
my sister found it.

85
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,600
Judging by my email,
a number of prisoners

86
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,300
at the Michigan State
Penitentiary found it.

87
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,700
What exactly did this guy write?

88
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,400
Not that I need to know the details
of your sex life. I just thought...

89
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Never mind.

90
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,700
No, you know what?

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,000
You might as well read it.
Everybody else has. Go ahead.

92
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,900
Oh, God, I just feel
so betrayed and embarrassed!

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
I just want to crawl
into a hole and die!

94
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay. Well, you know,
this isn't that bad.

95
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,900
It just paints the picture

96
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,900
of a very affectionate woman,

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,500
who's open to expressing her affection

98
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,100
in non-traditional locales.

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,700
Oh, God!

100
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
Elevators, parks,

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,700
movie theaters.

102
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,800
Out of curiosity,

103
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,000
is this "subway"
the transportation system

104
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,000
or Subway the sandwich shop?

105
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,400
Sandwich shop.

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
Doesn't that violate the health code?

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, at the sub shop
we were only making out.

108
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,100
But my point is that

109
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,700
you have absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed.

110
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,800
Really?
Do you think I overreacted?

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that. I do overreact.

112
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,100
Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.

113
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,500
That would be under-reacting.

114
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,600
He did break the implied
confidentiality of the bedroom.

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,700
And in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast food franchise.

116
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,700
You're right.
I should just say "I am done with him."

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,600
Yes, you should.
Go ahead, say it.

118
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,900
But I never gave the man
a chance to explain.

119
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,700
The betrayal!

121
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,700
No, you were right
the first time.

122
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,300
This is a man who loves me,
but in his own stupid way,

123
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,200
which is trying to show people
how he feels.

124
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,600
You did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh, good for me.

127
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,200
Where are you going?

128
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,900
I'm going over to Mike's.
Leonard, thank you so much.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,100
Oh, sure.

130
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,800
Maybe I <i>am</i> her gay friend.

131
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,300
I'm going to need
another Mandarin lesson.

132
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,200
I obviously didn't make
my point with those people.

133
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
For God's sake,

134
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,700
if you don't like the tangerine chicken,
don't order the tangerine chicken.

135
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
I like tangerine chicken,
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

137
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,300
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her boyfriend.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Just roll the dice.

139
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,200
"Enslaved by warlocks. Stay here
until you roll two, four or six."

140
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
She was mad at him!

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,700
She was done with him! The relationship
was broken beyond repair,

142
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,200
and I walked over there,
and I fixed it.

143
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,400
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

144
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Actually, I thought the first
two renditions were far more compelling.

145
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,200
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character,

146
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,100
now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,800
Eat your tangerine chicken.

148
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,800
I'd love to, but I don't
have tangerine chicken.

149
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice!

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,600
Incredible.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,700
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

152
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm back.

153
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

154
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,200
It's not your fault.

155
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,000
What happened?

156
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,300
I went over to Mike's
to make up with him.

157
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah. No, I know that part.

158
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
But he had already moved on.

159
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
Already? That was quick.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,900
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs around his neck.

161
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,400
- Penny, I am so sorry.
- How could he do that?!

162
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,100
You know, you did
throw an 80-gig iPod...

163
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,200
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

164
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,100
I swear to God I am done
with guys like that.

165
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,000
You know, macho with the perfect body
and the hair and the money.

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah, that must get old quick.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,300
You know, just once

168
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
I would like to go out with someone

169
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,000
who is nice and honest

170
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,200
and who actually cares about me.

171
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,400
What about me?

172
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
What about you what?

173
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,700
What about if you went out with me?

174
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Are you asking me out?

175
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,300
Yes, I am...

176
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
asking you out.

177
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,600
I was just going off
your comment about the nice guy.

178
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,200
- No, I got that.
- And honest.

179
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,400
- Totally.
- It's not a big deal.

180
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
Yes what?

181
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Yes, I will go out with you.

182
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,600
Really?

183
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,100
Why not? I mean...
What do I have to lose?

184
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,100
That's the spirit.

185
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Show me your citrus peels.

186
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,900
<i>Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.</i>

187
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,900
Show me your citrus peels.

188
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
<i>Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.</i>

189
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,500
Sheldon?

190
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,900
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,600
Look, do you have a second?

192
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,200
A second what, pair of underwear?

193
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
I was just wondering if I could
talk to you. It's about Leonard.

194
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,400
Why me?

195
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk,

197
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

198
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,500
Yes, I suppose he is.

199
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,700
All I'm saying is,
you know Leonard the best.

200
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,000
Not necessarily.

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

202
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,400
Just the other day I discovered
he not only has a loofah,

203
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,800
he hides it.

204
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,200
Why do you suppose a man would
be ashamed of having a loofah?

205
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,600
I, myself, prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally,

206
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,100
but I don't condemn those who seek
to accelerate the process.

207
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,300
And until recently,

208
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,200
I had no idea that
despite his lactose intolerance,

209
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,900
he can tolerate small amounts
of non-fat ice cream

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,300
without producing a noxious
gas that I maintain,

211
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,800
in the right concentration,
could be weaponized.

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,900
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
We're not done?

214
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,500
No.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
Why not? We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

216
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,300
Okay, so here's the thing...

217
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

218
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,700
He didn't actually say anything,
but when he came back to the apartment

219
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,400
he was doing a dance that brought
to mind the happy hippos in <i>Fantasia</i>.

220
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,600
That's nice.

221
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Anyhow, the thing I wanted
to talk to you about

222
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,900
is, since Leonard and I
have become friends... I was just...

223
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Wanna sit down?

224
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
I wish it were that simple.

225
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,300
I don't spend much time here, and so
I've never really chosena place to sit.

226
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,900
Well, choose.

227
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,800
There are a number of options and...

228
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,500
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities,

229
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,700
air flow patterns
and dispersion of unlight

230
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
to make an informed choice.

231
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,500
Why don't you just pick one at random
and if you don't like it

232
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,700
- you can sit somewhere else next time.
- No. That's crazy.

233
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,100
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

234
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Here's the thing.

235
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,100
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had

236
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
- a little crush on me...
- A little crush?

237
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,500
I suppose so... in the same way Menelaus
had a "little crush" on Helen of Troy.

238
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,300
I don't really know who they are...

239
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,900
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon.
- I don't care.

240
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,200
The point is,

241
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,300
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

242
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,700
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

243
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,700
Would you be open to rotating
the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

244
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,400
No. What I'm saying is

245
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Leonard might be
different in a good way.

246
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,800
Obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,100
Your last one worked
out well for Koothrappali.

248
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,700
He got a free iPod.

249
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,300
Glare.

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,800
On the other hand,
if things don't go well with Leonard,

251
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,100
I risk losing a really good friend.

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm guessing he's not looking
for a fling.

253
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,700
He's the kind of guy that gets
into a relationship for...

254
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,400
- like you would say, light years.
- I would not say that.

255
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
No one would say that. A light year
is a unit of distance not time.

256
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Thank you for the clarification.

257
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Draft.

258
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
People hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,600
"Foot-pound" has the same problem,
that's a unit of work, not of weight.

260
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Right. Thanks.

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,300
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

262
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,100
I think this will be my seat.

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,100
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do with

264
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,600
what I'm talking about?

265
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, let's see...

266
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,800
We might consider Schrodinger's cat.

267
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Schrodinger?
Is that the woman in 2A?

268
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,600
That's Mrs. Grossinger.

269
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,000
She doesn't have a cat,
she has a Mexican hairless.

270
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,000
- Annoying little animal.
- Sheldon.

271
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,500
Sorry, you diverted me.

272
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,900
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger,

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,300
in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics,

274
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,900
he proposed an experiment

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,700
where a cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison

276
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
that will break open at a random time.

277
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,300
Now, since no one knows

278
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,300
when or if the poison has been released,
until the box is opened,

279
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,900
the cat can be thought of
as both alive and dead.

280
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Sorry. I don't get the point.

281
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

282
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,900
You'd have to be psychic to get it,
and there's no such thing as "psychic."

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,600
Sheldon, what's the point?!

284
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,400
Just like Schrodinger's cat,

285
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,100
your potential relationship
with Leonard right now

286
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
can be thought of as both good and bad.

287
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,900
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

288
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, so you're saying I should
go out with Leonard.

289
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,800
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger...

290
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Two seats right there.

291
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
- Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.
- I can see that.

292
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
Unless you're planning on running
a marathon, choosing both stuffing

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,400
and mashed potatoes
is a starch-filled redundancy.

294
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,500
No, it's about Penny.

295
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
A mistake involving Penny.

296
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,600
You'll have to narrow it down.

297
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

298
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,100
Then don't.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,900
Other people would say "Why not?"

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Other people might be interested.

301
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,200
- I'm going to talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

302
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,900
Now that I'm actually about
to go out with Penny,

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

304
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,300
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

305
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Starch absorbs fluid
which reduces the amount of vomit

306
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,200
available for violent expulsion.

307
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,400
Right.

308
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
You also made a common
grammatical mistake.

309
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
You said "nauseous,"
when you meant "nauseated."

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
But go on.

311
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,900
Sheldon, this date is probably
my one chance with Penny.

312
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,700
What happens if I blow it?

313
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,100
Well, if we accept your premise

314
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
and also accept the highly
improbable assumption

315
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,300
that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you,

316
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,000
then we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it

317
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,500
would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

318
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,100
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers

319
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,400
from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind.

320
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,900
You're not helping.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,700
What response on my part

322
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,000
would bring this conversation
to a speedy conclusion?

323
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

324
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,400
Schrodinger's cat.

325
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
That's brilliant.

326
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,200
You sound surprised.

327
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

328
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,700
You look very nice.

329
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,100
Thank you. So do you.

330
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,400
I made an 8:00 reservation.

331
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

332
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,000
Maybe we should talk first.

333
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,300
But before you say anything, have you
ever heard of Schrodinger's cat?

334
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,000
Actually, I've heard far too much
about Schrodinger's cat.

335
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,600
Good.

336
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.

337
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,500
Crazy man. Call the police!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
