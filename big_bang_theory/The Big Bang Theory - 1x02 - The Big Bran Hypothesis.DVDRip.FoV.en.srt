1
00:00:01,851 --> 00:00:04,046
Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,482
Does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:05,655 --> 00:00:06,679
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:06,856 --> 00:00:10,792
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,157
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:17,394
- Any chopsticks?
- Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

7
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:18,898
Here we go.

8
00:00:19,069 --> 00:00:22,197
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.

9
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:26,103
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...

10
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,471
...which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:31,170
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

12
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:33,979
I'll get it.

13
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,812
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,277
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,514
- Am I interrupting?
- No.

16
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,123
You're not swelling, Howard.

17
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,624
No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,560
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,163
So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

20
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,098
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,602
...people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

22
00:00:56,773 --> 00:01:01,767
So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

23
00:01:02,746 --> 00:01:05,271
Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

24
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:07,707
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:09,784
I was wondering
if you could help me out...

26
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,080
- Yes.
- Oh.

27
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,587
Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

28
00:01:14,758 --> 00:01:17,090
...and I may not be here, so, oh...

29
00:01:18,061 --> 00:01:19,392
Hello.

30
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,690
I'm sorry?

31
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:28,201
Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

32
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:30,965
- No, I haven't.
- Get used to it.

33
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,236
Yeah, I probably won't.

34
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,334
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

35
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,207
Hey, Raj.

36
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,512
Still not talking to me, huh?

37
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,742
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

38
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,683
- He can't talk to women.
- He can't talk to attractive women.

39
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,346
Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

40
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,487
- There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
- Yeah.

41
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:55,256
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

42
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:57,729
- Yeah, no problem.
- Great, here's my spare key.

43
00:01:57,901 --> 00:01:59,528
Thank you.

44
00:02:00,904 --> 00:02:02,098
- Penny, wait.
- Yeah?

45
00:02:03,473 --> 00:02:04,838
Um...

46
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,069
If you don't have any other plans...

47
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:10,406
...do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

48
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,378
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

49
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:16,684
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,549
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

51
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,019
...and Superman catches her.

52
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:23,625
<i>- Which one was that?
- One.</i>

53
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:27,630
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

54
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,526
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

55
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,189
No, let's assume that they can.

56
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,264
Lois Lane is falling.

57
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,905
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

58
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,133
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

59
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,039
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

60
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,646
...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...

61
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,749
...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,452
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:54,351
In what space, sir? In what space?

64
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:55,923
She's 2 feet above the ground.

65
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:59,119
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

66
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,627
- It would be a more merciful death.
- That doesn't...

67
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,564
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...

68
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:08,067
...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

69
00:03:08,238 --> 00:03:09,637
Are you listening to yourself?

70
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,967
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

71
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:14,405
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...

72
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,704
...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun...

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,745
How does he fly at night?

74
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,042
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

75
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:24,243
...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

76
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:27,317
I'm just gonna go wash up.

77
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,355
I have 2600 comic books in there.

78
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,086
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

79
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:35,493
Challenge accepted.

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,767
We're locked out.

81
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:42,097
Also, the pretty girl left.

82
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:08,589
Okay.

83
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:12,030
Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna...

84
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:14,726
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

85
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:19,936
- I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
- I hardly think so.

86
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,076
Why not?

87
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,837
Well, we don't have a dolly...

88
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,744
...or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

89
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,581
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

90
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:33,085
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

91
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,781
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

92
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,655
It's just a matter... I don't have this!
I do not have this!

93
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,359
Archimedes would be so proud.

94
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:49,867
Do you have any ideas?

95
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,133
Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

96
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:58,239
Easy. Easy.

97
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:04,082
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

98
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:07,711
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

99
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,755
...call it 30 degrees, so about half.

100
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:11,826
Exactly half.

101
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:14,394
Exactly half.

102
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,689
Let's push.

103
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,059
Okay.

104
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,296
See, it's moving. This is easy.

105
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,906
It's all in the math.

106
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,506
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

107
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,982
Oh, okay.

108
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,245
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

109
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:46,255
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

110
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,397
You do understand
that our efforts here...

111
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:54,025
...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

112
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:57,097
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

113
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,332
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

114
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,934
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

115
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:07,279
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

116
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,047
Almost there.

117
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,085
Almost there.

118
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:14,917
- Almost there.
No, we're not.

119
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,286
- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:06:18,494 --> 00:06:19,859
- Watch your fingers.
- Yeah.

121
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:22,497
Oh, God, my fingers!

122
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,226
- You okay?
- No, it hurt...

123
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:29,633
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

124
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,673
So Penny is a little messy.

125
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:34,503
A little messy?

126
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,578
The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

127
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,873
This is chaos.

128
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,016
Excuse me.

129
00:06:41,184 --> 00:06:42,481
Explain to me a system...

130
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,815
...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

131
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,956
I'm just inferring that this as a couch...

132
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:52,060
...because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

133
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:56,262
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort...

134
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:58,900
...organize and label
the entire world around them?

135
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:01,396
No.

136
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,565
Well, they don't.

137
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:05,206
Hard as it may be to believe...

138
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:09,868
...most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

139
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:13,644
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

140
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,079
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

141
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,923
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

142
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,992
Sheldon, this is not your home.

143
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:28,722
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

144
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:34,000
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

145
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,364
Because it was immaculate.

146
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,529
I mean, you open that man's closet...

147
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:43,009
...it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

148
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:47,379
- What were you doing in his closet?
- I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

149
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,347
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Penny.

150
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,612
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

151
00:07:51,787 --> 00:07:54,017
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

152
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,350
- No.
- No?

153
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,188
- No.
- No.

154
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:01,330
- We'll get out of your hair.
- Okay, great.

155
00:08:01,497 --> 00:08:03,556
Thank you again.

156
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,233
Penny?

157
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,270
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

158
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,071
I'm here for you.

159
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,541
What's he talking about?

160
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,278
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

161
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:20,847
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

162
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:34,056
Sheldon?

163
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,604
Sheldon?

164
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:51,973
Hello?

165
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,264
- Sheldon?
- Shh!

166
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,935
Penny's sleeping.

167
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,471
Are you insane?

168
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,240
You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

169
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:27,439
I had no choice.

170
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:31,109
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...

171
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,551
...and outside our living room
was that hallway...

172
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:37,022
...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

173
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:40,194
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

174
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,196
...there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

175
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:46,124
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

176
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:49,067
No, no. You gave me an explanation.

177
00:09:49,238 --> 00:09:52,571
It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

178
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,042
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

179
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,077
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

180
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:04,215
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

181
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,054
What?

182
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:09,680
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

183
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,986
...so that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

184
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:16,222
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

185
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:18,495
That's ridiculous!

186
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:26,307
No, that's ridiculous.

187
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,541
Fine.

188
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,612
I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

189
00:10:34,784 --> 00:10:37,776
- I'm not leaving until I'm done.
- Oh, no.

190
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:45,124
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

191
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,592
Oh, what the hell.

192
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,507
Good morning.

193
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,233
Morning.

194
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,743
I have to say I slept splendidly.

195
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,111
Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

196
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:09,342
I'm not surprised.

197
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:11,281
A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

198
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:14,252
...is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

199
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:16,784
Sarcasm?

200
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,119
You think?

201
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,421
Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

202
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,395
...but the end result
will be a measurable enhancement...

203
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:26,296
...to Penny's quality of life.

204
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:29,961
You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

205
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,074
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

206
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:34,709
For God's sake, Sheldon...

207
00:11:34,877 --> 00:11:38,643
...do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

208
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:41,681
You have a sarcasm sign?

209
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,977
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

210
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:47,579
You want some cereal?

211
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:51,215
I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

212
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:53,658
Hello, Honey Puffs.

213
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,888
Son of a bitch!

214
00:11:56,832 --> 00:11:58,697
Penny's up.

215
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:01,894
You sick, geeky bastards!

216
00:12:02,838 --> 00:12:04,863
How did she know it was us?

217
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,466
I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

218
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,339
...for her bedroom closet.

219
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:11,537
Leonard?

220
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:12,806
This is gonna be bad.

221
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:16,110
Goodbye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.

222
00:12:16,585 --> 00:12:18,917
You came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

223
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:20,248
Yes, but only to clean.

224
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,915
Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

225
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,254
Give me back my key.

226
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:28,220
I'm very, very sorry.

227
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,661
Do you understand how creepy this is?

228
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,858
Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

229
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:35,560
In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

230
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:38,707
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

231
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:42,469
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

232
00:12:45,147 --> 00:12:46,944
The throat doctor.

233
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:51,553
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

234
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,448
Depending on the depth...

235
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:58,855
...that's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

236
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,365
Oh.

237
00:13:08,137 --> 00:13:09,627
- God!
- Okay, look. No, Penny...

238
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,672
I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...

239
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:16,039
...when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

240
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,770
...maybe we can talk about this.

241
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,381
- Stay away from me.
- Sure. That's another way to go.

242
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,574
Penny, Penny, hold on.

243
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,116
Just to clarify...

244
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,154
...because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

245
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:32,283
Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...

246
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:37,023
...or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?

247
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:45,535
Well, that was a little non-responsive.

248
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,240
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

249
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:55,573
What's funny?

250
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,719
That wasn't sarcasm?

251
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,747
- No!
- Whoo.

252
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,221
Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

253
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:10,195
I have a Master's and two Ph. Ds,
I should not have to do this.

254
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,999
What?

255
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,465
I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

256
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:16,468
I take full responsibility.

257
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,233
I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

258
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:25,506
...who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

259
00:14:37,393 --> 00:14:39,520
I did what I could.

260
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:45,394
Hey, Raj.

261
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:53,836
Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

262
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,670
...but I'm really upset about it.

263
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:59,007
I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

264
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,979
Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

265
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,415
<i>She's standing very close to me.</i>

266
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,012
<i>Oh, my. She does smell good.</i>

267
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:09,521
<i>What is that? Vanilla?</i>

268
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:10,716
You know?

269
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:14,090
Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

270
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:16,060
Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

271
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:20,861
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

272
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,094
What was I saying?

273
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:24,899
<i>She's so chatty.</i>

274
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:29,670
<i>Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.</i>

275
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,710
<i>We'd have
the same cultural background...</i>

276
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,372
<i>...and my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.</i>

277
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:36,984
It's obvious they meant well.

278
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:39,211
I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said...

279
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:41,720
...I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.

280
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,863
I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

281
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,024
...doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

282
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,533
Right?

283
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,570
<i>She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.</i>

284
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,974
That's exactly what I thought.

285
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:03,475
Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

286
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,006
<i>Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.</i>

287
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:24,426
Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

288
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,159
It's fine. You win.

289
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,098
What's his problem?

290
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:34,269
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

291
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,803
Been there.

292
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:40,775
Hello.

293
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:44,385
Sorry I'm late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

294
00:16:44,887 --> 00:16:45,945
Really? You?

295
00:16:46,121 --> 00:16:48,316
Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?

296
00:16:48,657 --> 00:16:51,524
Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

297
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,019
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

298
00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:55,663
Well, she was upset at first...

299
00:16:55,831 --> 00:16:59,289
...but probably
because her sister shot somebody.

300
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:04,537
Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

301
00:17:04,707 --> 00:17:08,006
She hugged you? How did she hug you?

302
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:18,318
Is that her perfume I smell?

303
00:17:19,688 --> 00:17:21,656
Intoxicating, isn't it?

304
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,802
- Hi.
- Oh.

305
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,501
What's going on?

306
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,740
Uh...

307
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:46,881
Here's the thing:

308
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,949
"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb...

309
00:17:57,126 --> 00:17:59,390
...so too I regret my participation
in what was...

310
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:02,325
...at the very least, an error in judgment.

311
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,526
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

312
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,965
...is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

313
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:11,868
Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential...

314
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,340
...even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

315
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,674
Another example,
from the field of Ebola research... "

316
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,373
Leonard.

317
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:24,143
Yeah?

318
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:28,251
We're okay.

319
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,041
Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.

320
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,476
- One package Philips head screws?
- Check.

321
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,616
Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

322
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,978
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

323
00:18:57,152 --> 00:18:59,712
I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

324
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,721
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering...

325
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,983
Considering what?

326
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:06,992
How great this place looks?

327
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,762
- Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
- What?

328
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,457
These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

329
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,432
...of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

330
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:18,437
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

331
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:22,868
- It looked pretty good in the store.
- It is an inefficient design.

332
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,637
For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

333
00:19:24,813 --> 00:19:26,838
...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

334
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:29,643
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

335
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:34,084
Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

336
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,190
- Good point. How will you cool it?
- Guys, I got this.

337
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,520
- Hang on, Penny.
- How about fans?

338
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:43,096
- Here and here.
- Also inefficient, and might be loud.

339
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,790
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

340
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:47,458
Run some quarter-inch PVC...

341
00:19:47,636 --> 00:19:49,467
Guys, this is actually really simple.

342
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,797
Hold on, honey, men at work.

343
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:57,645
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

344
00:19:57,813 --> 00:20:01,271
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

345
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,385
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

346
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:08,216
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

347
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:14,656
Oh, I've got it.

348
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:20,430
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

349
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:22,763
- Entire thing's one big heat sink.
- Perfect.

350
00:20:22,938 --> 00:20:26,499
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

351
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:29,473
- Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
- Meet in an hour?

352
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,408
- Done.
- Got it.

353
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,581
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
