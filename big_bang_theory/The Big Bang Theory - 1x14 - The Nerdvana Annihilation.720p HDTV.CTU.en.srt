1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:03,371
This sandwich is
an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:07,761
I asked for turkey and roast beef
with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,058
- What did they give you?
- Turkey and roast beef

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,277
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,648
It's the right ingredients,
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:22,983
In a proper sandwich,

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,906
the cheese is adjacent to the bread

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,706
to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,743
They might as well have dragged
this thing through a car wash.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,621
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

11
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:38,749
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature Time Machine prop

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,335
from the original film,
and no one is bidding on it.

13
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,255
A time machine
from the movie <i>The Time Machine</i>?

14
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:47,176
No. A time machine
from <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,566
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

16
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,452
Did you see it? It's rough.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,654
- That's cool.
- It's only $800?

18
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,342
Yeah. And that's my bid.

19
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:59,896
You bid $800?

20
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:02,962
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
I figured it would go for thousands,

21
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:04,983
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

22
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:07,023
There's only 30 sec left in the auction.

23
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,279
Do you have $800?

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,656
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

25
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,115
Don't worry. People wait
until the last second to bid,

26
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:15,202
and they swoop in and get it.
It's called sniping.

27
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,413
15 seconds.

28
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:18,176
Come on, snipers.

29
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,266
10, 9,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,799
- 8...
- Where are your snipers?

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,188
- 5...
- Snipe.

32
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:26,331
- 4...
- Snipe.

33
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,474
- 3...
- Snipe!

34
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:28,731
- 2...
- Snipe!

35
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:29,664
1...

36
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,845
Congratulations!

37
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:34,472
You are the proud owner
of a miniature time machine!

38
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,290
You lucky duck.

39
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,303
I wonder why no one else bid.

40
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:41,893
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

41
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:45,357
- Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.
- Why don't we share it?

42
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,527
We'll each put in 200 bucks,
we'll take turns having it in our house.

43
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,354
A time-share time machine.

44
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,259
I'm in. Sheldon?

45
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,535
Need you ask?

46
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,678
I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

47
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:09,203
I understand
why no one else bid.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,000
Season 1 Episode 14: 
The Nerdvana Annihilation

1
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Did the listing actually
say "miniature"?

2
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
I just assumed.

3
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,700
Who sells a full-size
time machine for $800?

4
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,500
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located

5
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,700
within the intersection of the sets
"No longer want my time machine"

6
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,100
and "Need $800."

7
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,500
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

8
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,900
Even with shipping, it works out
to less than four dollars a pound.

9
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,800
Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.

10
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,500
How are we going to get it upstairs?

11
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,700
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

12
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,200
Yes, but the elevator
has been broken for 2 years.

13
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
I've been meaning to ask you.

14
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you think we should
make a call about that?

15
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

16
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,700
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

17
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

18
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,900
When the Mars Rover started
pulling to the left,

19
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
I performed a front-end alignment

20
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,600
from 62 million miles away.

21
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,400
No. That baby's broken.

22
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,700
Come on, guys! Push!

23
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,100
If I push any harder,
I'm going to give birth to my colon.

24
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up!

25
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
It's the same amount of work
no matter how fast you go.

26
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,300
- Basic physics.
- Sheldon?

27
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,300
If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,200
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

29
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,500
Take a break, guys.

30
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,300
- What are you doing?
- We're just moving something upstairs.

31
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,100
- What is it?
- Just...

32
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,300
You know. Time machine.

33
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,600
Neat. But I really got to get to work.

34
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,700
- Give us a few minutes.
- I don't have them. I'm running late.

35
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,500
Then, I have a simple solution.

36
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,700
Go up to the roof.
Hop over to the next building.

37
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,300
There's a small gap, don't look down
if you're subject to vertigo,

38
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,000
and use their stairwell.

39
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,900
You're joking, right?

40
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,300
I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

41
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,000
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

42
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine,

43
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
I can drop you off at work yesterday.

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Time travel joke.
It's not... never mind.

45
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,400
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

46
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Let's just do this.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
- You guys ready to push?
- In a minute.

48
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,400
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

49
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,900
I don't know
what you were worried about.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,900
I think it really works in the room.

51
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,100
It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

52
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,100
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor

53
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,100
from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future,

54
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,400
where society had splintered
into two factions:

55
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,200
the subterranean Morlocks,
who survived by feasting

56
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,800
on the flesh of the gentle
surface-dwelling Eloi.

57
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,400
Talk about your chick magnets.

58
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
The guy who lives next to me
is always like,

59
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,200
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,700
But wait until I tell him,

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,900
"I've got a time machine
on my balcony.

62
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
Stuff that in your Speedoes,
Jacuzzi Bob."

63
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,100
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns,
but I think you'll agree

64
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
that practicality
dictates it remain here.

65
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,500
You can't keep it here.
What if I meet a girl and say,

66
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,300
"You wanna come up and see
my time machine?

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,800
It's at my friends' house."
How lame is that?

68
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,600
He's got a point.

69
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,900
I think we're going to need some ground
rules; in addition to the expected

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,800
"no shoes in the time machine,"
and "no eating in the time machine,"

71
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,800
I propose we add "pants must be worn
at all times in the time machine."

72
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,800
Seconded.

73
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,900
I was going to put down a towel.

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,100
I still want it on my balcony.

75
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,600
I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.

76
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
- That sounds fair.
- Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term.

77
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,700
It's every other month or twice a month?

78
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,500
- Twice a month.
- Then no.

79
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,500
- Okay, every other month.
- No.

80
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,600
You can't be selfish.

81
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,100
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

82
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,800
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

83
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,800
I am setting the dials
for March 10, 1876.

84
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,500
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell
invents the telephone

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,700
- and calls out for Dr. Watson.
- Wait a minute.

86
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,400
- I'd want to see that, too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

87
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
But if we all go back to the same point,

88
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.
He'll know something's up.

89
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Also since the time machine
doesn't move in space,

90
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,800
you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.

91
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,400
And even if you can make it to Boston,
are you going knock on the door

92
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
and say to Mrs. Bell,
"Big fan of your husband.

93
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
"Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

94
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,300
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even going to hear you knock.

95
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,200
I have a solution.
First, go into the future

96
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,100
- and obtain a cloaking device.
- How far into the future?

97
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,100
If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk
will steal a cloaking device

98
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,200
from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3,

99
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,500
which would be January 10, 2328
by pre-Federation reckoning.

100
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,900
I am setting the dials
for January 10, 2328.

101
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,800
Here we go into the future.

102
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
That was fun.

103
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,800
My turn!

104
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,800
Okay, first of all,

105
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,400
what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

106
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,600
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

107
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Second of all, the door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked,

108
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,200
so I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the 3d floor,

109
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,300
forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family

110
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
who insisted I stay for lunch.

111
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,300
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It was eight courses of lamb,

112
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,500
and they tried to fix me up
with their son.

113
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,900
- Sorry.
- Not done.

114
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,800
By the time I finally got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

115
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,300
That's right. I lost an entire day's pay
thanks to this.

116
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,100
- This...
- Time machine.

117
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,200
The lights flash and the dish spins.
You want to try it?

118
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,800
I don't want to try it!

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
My God, you are grown men!

120
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,100
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys and costumes

121
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,000
and comic books
and now that?! That...

122
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,600
Again. Time machine.

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,800
Please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like something

124
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,500
Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

125
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
It only moves in time.

126
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,900
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,200
Pathetic! All of you!

128
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,000
Completely pathetic!

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
My turn!

130
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.

131
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,300
So?

132
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,100
So it's my turn.

133
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
Why did you set it
for the day before yesterday?

134
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,800
Because I want to go back
and keep myself

135
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,400
from getting a time machine.

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,500
You can't.

137
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past,

138
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,200
you wouldn't have it available
in the present to travel back

139
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,700
and stop yourself from buying it.
Ergo, you would still have it.

140
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,200
This is a classic rookie
time-travel mistake.

141
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,600
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaing that to me?

142
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Same paradox.

143
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,200
If you were to travel back in time
and, say, knock me unconscious,

144
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,600
you would not then have the conversation
that irritated you,

145
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,500
motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

146
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,100
What if I knocked you
unconscious right now?

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
It won't change the past.

148
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,400
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

149
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,700
Are you upset about something?

150
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
What was your first clue?

151
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,600
Well, it was a number of things.

152
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,000
First, the late hour.

153
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,100
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy,

154
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,400
- plus your irritability.
- Yes, I'm upset!

155
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,500
I don't usually pick
up on those things.

156
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Good for me.

157
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,600
Good for you.

158
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,500
Wait.

159
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,900
Did you want to talk about
what's bothering you?

160
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,900
- I don't know. Maybe.
- I'm on fire tonight.

161
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,700
Here's the thing.

162
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,100
Girls like Penny never end up
with guys who own time machines.

163
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,800
I disagree.

164
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,500
Your inability to
successfully woo Penny

165
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,100
long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

166
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,900
That failure clearly
stands on its own.

167
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,700
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

168
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux

169
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,200
with that very time machine.

170
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,900
In <i>Back to the Future</i>,
Marty McFly got the opportunity

171
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,600
to hook up with his extremely
attractive young mother.

172
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,300
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

173
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Were you expecting me to come up
with an example

174
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,600
involving a real-life time machine?

175
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,000
That's absurd.

176
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Come on, guys, push!

177
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,000
If I push any harder, I'm going
to give birth to my colon.

178
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,900
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

179
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,900
Take a break, guys!

180
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
- What are you doing?
- You know, just moving a time machine.

181
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,500
Neat, but I really gotta get to work.

182
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,300
No problem.

183
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,100
Hang on.

184
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,300
But... what about your time machine?

185
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,000
Some things are more
important than toys.

186
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm scared.

187
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,200
Don't worry, baby. I've got you.

188
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
It's still my turn.

189
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,800
What are you doing?

190
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm packing up all my collectibles

191
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,500
and taking them down
to the comic book store to sell.

192
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,500
Was that really necessary?

193
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,400
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

194
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,000
And semen.

195
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,300
This is not about money.

196
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,900
We brought food!

197
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,900
Lox and bagels, the
breakfast of time-travelers.

198
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Terrific. Does anyone want to buy
my share of the time machine?

199
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,300
- Why?
- I don't want it anymore.

200
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,700
- Why?
- Just... personal reasons.

201
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,900
My Spidey sense tells me this
has something to do with Penny.

202
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
Look, do you want to
buy me out or not?

203
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,100
I'll give you $100,
which will make me half-owner

204
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,700
and we'll put it on my balcony.

205
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,600
Screw his balcony. I'll give you
$120 and we'll put it in my garage.

206
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,600
I paid $200 for my share.

207
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,300
Dude, everybody knows a time
machine loses half its value

208
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
the minute you drive
it off the lot.

209
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll go for $200. That time
machine stays right where it is.

210
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,500
$300 and I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon

211
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,400
with real light speed sound effects.

212
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,100
No. No more toys or action figures

213
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,400
or props or replicas
or costumes or robots

214
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,200
or Darth Vader voice changers.

215
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm getting rid of all of it.

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,300
You can't do that. Look
what you've created here.

217
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,200
It's like nerdvana.

218
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,600
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

219
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,600
Not for long.

220
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,400
I call dibs on <i>The Golden Age Flash</i>.

221
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,100
I need that to complete my
<i>Justice Society of America</i> collection.

222
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,600
- Too bad. I called dibs.
- You can't just call dibs.

223
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,200
I can and I did.
Look up "Dibs" in Wikipedia.

224
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,800
Dibs doesn't apply
in a bidding war.

225
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,300
It's not a bidding war.

226
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm selling it all to Larry
down at the comic book store.

227
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,600
- Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?!

228
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,000
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

229
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,000
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it plus a thousand rupees.

230
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,500
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business.

231
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,000
Take it or leave it?

232
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,700
Mom? My bar mitzvah bonds.
How much do I got?

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Thanks.

234
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,600
I can go $2,600 and two trees in Israel.

235
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Forget it, guys.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,900
If I sell to one of you, the other two
are going to be really mad at me.

237
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,300
Who cares? As long as you pick me!

238
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

239
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,400
Sorry, Raj. My mind is made up.

240
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,500
No!

241
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,900
I can't let you do this.

242
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,900
Get out of my way.

243
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,700
None shall pass!

244
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,400
I did not want to do this,

245
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
but I have here the rare mint
condition production error

246
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,300
<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>
Geordi La Forge

247
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,900
without his visor
in the original packaging.

248
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,600
If you do not get out of my way,

249
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,500
I will open it.

250
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
Okay, man. Be cool.

251
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,100
We're all friends here.

252
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,000
What the hell's going on?

253
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
You hypocrite!

254
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,000
What?

255
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,500
Little Miss "grown-ups
don't play with toys."

256
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,200
If I were to go into that apartment now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

257
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,200
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

258
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,300
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

259
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,700
Hello, Hello Kitty!

260
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Okay, look, if this is about yesterday,
Leonard,

261
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,000
I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

262
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
- I need to hear it.
- No, you didn't. You are a great guy

263
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,200
and it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

264
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,400
I guess that makes
me "large breasts."

265
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,900
Still, I think it's time for
me to get rid of this stuff

266
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,100
and, you know,
move on with my life.

267
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

268
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, good for you.

269
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Thanks.

270
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Do you want to...
I don't know, later...

271
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Excuse me.

272
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,100
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

273
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
- Ready to go?
- I just have to change.

274
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,600
- I'll give you a hand.
- Stop it!

275
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,800
Bye, guys.

276
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
My turn on the time machine!

1
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,600
It worked.

2
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
It really worked.

3
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,900
They said I was mad, but it worked!

4
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,700
Not Morlocks!

5
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,300
Not flesh-eating Morlocks!

6
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Help!

7
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Sheldon, are you okay?

8
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
We have to get rid
of the time machine.

9
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,600
It is a little big
for the living room, isn't it?

10
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,900
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

11
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,400
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

12
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,800
Come on in, fellas.

13
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Morlocks!

14
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,400
Eat him. Eat him.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
