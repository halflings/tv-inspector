1
00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:03,371
This sandwich is
an unmitigated disaster.

2
00:00:04,124 --> 00:00:07,761
I asked for turkey and roast beef
with lettuce and Swiss on whole wheat.

3
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:10,058
- What did they give you?
- Turkey and roast beef

4
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,277
with Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.

5
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:20,648
It's the right ingredients,
but in the wrong order.

6
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:22,983
In a proper sandwich,

7
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:24,906
the cheese is adjacent to the bread

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:27,706
to create a moisture barrier
against the lettuce.

9
00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,743
They might as well have dragged
this thing through a car wash.

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,621
- I don't believe it.
- I know. It's basic culinary science.

11
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:38,749
Some guy is auctioning off
a miniature Time Machine prop

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,335
from the original film,
and no one is bidding on it.

13
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:44,255
A time machine
from the movie <i>The Time Machine</i>?

14
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:47,176
No. A time machine
from <i>Sophie's Choice</i>.

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,566
Boy, Sophie could have used
a time machine in that movie.

16
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:52,452
Did you see it? It's rough.

17
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,654
- That's cool.
- It's only $800?

18
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,342
Yeah. And that's my bid.

19
00:00:58,462 --> 00:00:59,896
You bid $800?

20
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:02,962
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
I figured it would go for thousands,

21
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:04,983
and I just wanted to be a part of it.

22
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:07,023
There's only 30 sec left in the auction.

23
00:01:07,143 --> 00:01:08,279
Do you have $800?

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,656
Not to blow on a miniature time machine.

25
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:13,115
Don't worry. People wait
until the last second to bid,

26
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:15,202
and they swoop in and get it.
It's called sniping.

27
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,413
15 seconds.

28
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:18,176
Come on, snipers.

29
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:21,266
10, 9,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,799
- 8...
- Where are your snipers?

31
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,188
- 5...
- Snipe.

32
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:26,331
- 4...
- Snipe.

33
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,474
- 3...
- Snipe!

34
00:01:27,594 --> 00:01:28,731
- 2...
- Snipe!

35
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:29,664
1...

36
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,845
Congratulations!

37
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:34,472
You are the proud owner
of a miniature time machine!

38
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,290
You lucky duck.

39
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,303
I wonder why no one else bid.

40
00:01:39,423 --> 00:01:41,893
This is a classic piece
of sci-fi movie memorabilia.

41
00:01:42,013 --> 00:01:45,357
- Yeah, I know! I still can't afford it.
- Why don't we share it?

42
00:01:45,523 --> 00:01:48,527
We'll each put in 200 bucks,
we'll take turns having it in our house.

43
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,354
A time-share time machine.

44
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,259
I'm in. Sheldon?

45
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,535
Need you ask?

46
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:57,678
I still don't understand
why no one else bid.

47
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:09,203
I understand
why no one else bid.

48
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,564
Episode 114: The Nerdvana Annihilation

49
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,766
Transcript: swsub.com
Sync: sub-way.fr | italiansubs.net

50
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,829
Did the listing actually
say "miniature"?

51
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,470
I just assumed.

52
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:48,118
Who sells a full-size
time machine for $800?

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,908
In a Venn diagram,
that would be an individual located

54
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:55,104
within the intersection of the sets
"No longer want my time machine"

55
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,542
and "Need $800."

56
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:59,960
It's actually a tremendous bargain.

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,337
Even with shipping, it works out
to less than four dollars a pound.

58
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:06,241
Cocktail shrimp are $12.50.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,925
How are we going to get it upstairs?

60
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:15,113
If we take the dish off,
it might fit in the elevator.

61
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,654
Yes, but the elevator
has been broken for 2 years.

62
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:19,224
I've been meaning to ask you.

63
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,621
Do you think we should
make a call about that?

64
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:26,257
Not necessary.
I have a Master's in engineering.

65
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:29,128
I remotely repair satellites
on a regular basis.

66
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:32,136
I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads.

67
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,342
When the Mars Rover started
pulling to the left,

68
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:37,643
I performed a front-end alignment

69
00:03:37,763 --> 00:03:40,027
from 62 million miles away.

70
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,816
No. That baby's broken.

71
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,140
Come on, guys! Push!

72
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,594
If I push any harder,
I'm going to give birth to my colon.

73
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,557
I can't feel my fingers. Hurry up!

74
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:05,032
It's the same amount of work
no matter how fast you go.

75
00:04:05,152 --> 00:04:06,784
- Basic physics.
- Sheldon?

76
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,774
If my fingers ever work again,
I've got a job for the middle one.

77
00:04:12,463 --> 00:04:14,634
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

78
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:18,990
Take a break, guys.

79
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:23,766
- What are you doing?
- We're just moving something upstairs.

80
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,519
- What is it?
- Just...

81
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:27,780
You know. Time machine.

82
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,024
Neat. But I really got to get to work.

83
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:34,110
- Give us a few minutes.
- I don't have them. I'm running late.

84
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,926
Then, I have a simple solution.

85
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:38,174
Go up to the roof.
Hop over to the next building.

86
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:40,726
There's a small gap, don't look down
if you're subject to vertigo,

87
00:04:40,846 --> 00:04:42,409
and use their stairwell.

88
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,370
You're joking, right?

89
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,763
I never joke when it comes to vertigo.

90
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,452
Damn. Okay, I'll just take the roof.

91
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,225
If you wait for us
to set up the time machine,

92
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,359
I can drop you off at work yesterday.

93
00:04:58,253 --> 00:05:00,261
Time travel joke.
It's not... never mind.

94
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:04,838
For what it's worth,
I thought it was humorous.

95
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,146
Let's just do this.

96
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:12,865
- You guys ready to push?
- In a minute.

97
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:14,899
Howard stepped outside to throw up.

98
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,364
I don't know
what you were worried about.

99
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:24,326
I think it really works in the room.

100
00:05:26,656 --> 00:05:29,511
It is by far the coolest thing
I have ever owned.

101
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:32,543
The exact time machine
that carried actor Rod Taylor

102
00:05:32,703 --> 00:05:35,591
from Victorian England
into the post-apocalyptic future,

103
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,867
where society had splintered
into two factions:

104
00:05:37,987 --> 00:05:40,657
the subterranean Morlocks,
who survived by feasting

105
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:43,273
on the flesh of the gentle
surface-dwelling Eloi.

106
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,803
Talk about your chick magnets.

107
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:53,217
The guy who lives next to me
is always like,

108
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:56,684
"I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony.
I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony."

109
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,175
But wait until I tell him,

110
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:00,395
"I've got a time machine
on my balcony.

111
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,479
Stuff that in your Speedoes,
Jacuzzi Bob."

112
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,551
Gentlemen, we said we'd take turns,
but I think you'll agree

113
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:11,290
that practicality
dictates it remain here.

114
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:13,904
You can't keep it here.
What if I meet a girl and say,

115
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,790
"You wanna come up and see
my time machine?

116
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,228
It's at my friends' house."
How lame is that?

117
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:20,047
He's got a point.

118
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:23,338
I think we're going to need some ground
rules; in addition to the expected

119
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:26,216
"no shoes in the time machine,"
and "no eating in the time machine,"

120
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:30,211
I propose we add "pants must be worn
at all times in the time machine."

121
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,298
Seconded.

122
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:35,316
I was going to put down a towel.

123
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,581
I still want it on my balcony.

124
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,031
I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.

125
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:46,159
- That sounds fair.
- Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term.

126
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
It's every other month or twice a month?

127
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,986
- Twice a month.
- Then no.

128
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,903
- Okay, every other month.
- No.

129
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,042
You can't be selfish.

130
00:06:55,203 --> 00:06:57,545
We all paid for it,
so it belongs to all of us.

131
00:06:57,706 --> 00:07:00,255
Now get out of the way
so I can sit in my time machine.

132
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:14,207
I am setting the dials
for March 10, 1876.

133
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:16,913
Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell
invents the telephone

134
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:19,123
- and calls out for Dr. Watson.
- Wait a minute.

135
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:21,819
- I'd want to see that, too.
- So when it's your turn, you can.

136
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:23,783
But if we all go back to the same point,

137
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,783
Bell's lab is going to get very crowded.
He'll know something's up.

138
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,951
Also since the time machine
doesn't move in space,

139
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,236
you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.

140
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,889
And even if you can make it to Boston,
are you going knock on the door

141
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:37,086
and say to Mrs. Bell,
"Big fan of your husband.

142
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:39,429
"Can I come in and watch him
invent the telephone?"

143
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,757
Mrs. Bell was deaf.
She's not even going to hear you knock.

144
00:07:44,102 --> 00:07:46,667
I have a solution.
First, go into the future

145
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:49,596
- and obtain a cloaking device.
- How far into the future?

146
00:07:49,757 --> 00:07:52,510
If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk
will steal a cloaking device

147
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,611
from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3,

148
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:58,972
which would be January 10, 2328
by pre-Federation reckoning.

149
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:05,302
I am setting the dials
for January 10, 2328.

150
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,292
Here we go into the future.

151
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:30,967
That was fun.

152
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:33,224
My turn!

153
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,249
Okay, first of all,

154
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:38,871
what you call a gap
was nearly three feet wide.

155
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,085
- I slipped and skinned my knee.
- Are you okay?

156
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,877
Second of all, the door to the stairwell
of the other building was locked,

157
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:47,612
so I had to go down the fire escape,
which ends on the 3d floor,

158
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:50,748
forcing me to crawl through the window
of a lovely Armenian family

159
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:52,735
who insisted I stay for lunch.

160
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,748
- That doesn't sound too bad.
- It was eight courses of lamb,

161
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,963
and they tried to fix me up
with their son.

162
00:09:01,177 --> 00:09:02,377
- Sorry.
- Not done.

163
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:05,213
By the time I finally got to work,
they'd given my shift away.

164
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,718
That's right. I lost an entire day's pay
thanks to this.

165
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:10,553
- This...
- Time machine.

166
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:16,638
The lights flash and the dish spins.
You want to try it?

167
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:19,270
I don't want to try it!

168
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:21,490
My God, you are grown men!

169
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:25,548
How can you waste your lives
with these stupid toys and costumes

170
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,404
and comic books
and now that?! That...

171
00:09:28,565 --> 00:09:30,062
Again. Time machine.

172
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,262
Please, it's not a time machine.
If anything, it looks like something

173
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,914
Elton John would drive
through the Everglades.

174
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,750
It only moves in time.

175
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,375
It would be worse than useless
in a swamp.

176
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,646
Pathetic! All of you!

177
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,451
Completely pathetic!

178
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:03,822
My turn!

1
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,733
Leonard, it's 2:00 in the morning.

2
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:24,710
So?

3
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,507
So it's my turn.

4
00:10:29,472 --> 00:10:31,959
Why did you set it
for the day before yesterday?

5
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:34,238
Because I want to go back
and keep myself

6
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:35,846
from getting a time machine.

7
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:36,914
You can't.

8
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,276
If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past,

9
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:41,657
you wouldn't have it available
in the present to travel back

10
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:44,145
and stop yourself from buying it.
Ergo, you would still have it.

11
00:10:44,307 --> 00:10:46,615
This is a classic rookie
time-travel mistake.

12
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:53,072
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaing that to me?

13
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,836
Same paradox.

14
00:10:54,956 --> 00:10:57,659
If you were to travel back in time
and, say, knock me unconscious,

15
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,090
you would not then have the conversation
that irritated you,

16
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,915
motivating you to go back
and knock me unconscious.

17
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,585
What if I knocked you
unconscious right now?

18
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,756
It won't change the past.

19
00:11:11,598 --> 00:11:13,884
But it'd make the present so much nicer.

20
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,119
Are you upset about something?

21
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,441
What was your first clue?

22
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:22,068
Well, it was a number of things.

23
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:23,454
First, the late hour.

24
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,573
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy,

25
00:11:25,693 --> 00:11:27,826
- plus your irritability.
- Yes, I'm upset!

26
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:30,964
I don't usually pick
up on those things.

27
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:32,674
Good for me.

28
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,078
Good for you.

29
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,907
Wait.

30
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,330
Did you want to talk about
what's bothering you?

31
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:47,375
- I don't know. Maybe.
- I'm on fire tonight.

32
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,148
Here's the thing.

33
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:58,561
Girls like Penny never end up
with guys who own time machines.

34
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,279
I disagree.

35
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:02,930
Your inability to
successfully woo Penny

36
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,569
long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.

37
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:10,375
That failure clearly
stands on its own.

38
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:15,176
- Thanks for pointing it out.
- In addition, your premise is flawed.

39
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,875
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux

40
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:19,658
with that very time machine.

41
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:22,322
In <i>Back to the Future</i>,
Marty McFly got the opportunity

42
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:25,046
to hook up with his extremely
attractive young mother.

43
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,704
- Those are movies.
- Of course they're movies.

44
00:12:30,824 --> 00:12:32,835
Were you expecting me to come up
with an example

45
00:12:32,955 --> 00:12:35,031
involving a real-life time machine?

46
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:38,461
That's absurd.

47
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:41,998
Come on, guys, push!

48
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:45,432
If I push any harder, I'm going
to give birth to my colon.

49
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,368
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Penny.

50
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:54,325
Take a break, guys!

51
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:59,429
- What are you doing?
- You know, just moving a time machine.

52
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,910
Neat, but I really gotta get to work.

53
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:04,714
No problem.

54
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:12,593
Hang on.

55
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,746
But... what about your time machine?

56
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,467
Some things are more
important than toys.

57
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,286
I'm scared.

58
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,624
Don't worry, baby. I've got you.

59
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:54,370
It's still my turn.

60
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,253
What are you doing?

61
00:14:02,513 --> 00:14:04,257
I'm packing up all my collectibles

62
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,950
and taking them down
to the comic book store to sell.

63
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,924
Was that really necessary?

64
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,837
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.

65
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:14,429
And semen.

66
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,723
This is not about money.

67
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,311
We brought food!

68
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:22,337
Lox and bagels, the
breakfast of time-travelers.

69
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,409
Terrific. Does anyone want to buy
my share of the time machine?

70
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,797
- Why?
- I don't want it anymore.

71
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:30,122
- Why?
- Just... personal reasons.

72
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:33,334
My Spidey sense tells me this
has something to do with Penny.

73
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,100
Look, do you want to
buy me out or not?

74
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,501
I'll give you $100,
which will make me half-owner

75
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:40,139
and we'll put it on my balcony.

76
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:43,051
Screw his balcony. I'll give you
$120 and we'll put it in my garage.

77
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,054
I paid $200 for my share.

78
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:47,791
Dude, everybody knows a time
machine loses half its value

79
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:49,901
the minute you drive
it off the lot.

80
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,019
I'll go for $200. That time
machine stays right where it is.

81
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,980
$300 and I'll throw in my original
1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon

82
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,817
with real light speed sound effects.

83
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:02,544
No. No more toys or action figures

84
00:15:02,797 --> 00:15:05,876
or props or replicas
or costumes or robots

85
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,681
or Darth Vader voice changers.

86
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,327
I'm getting rid of all of it.

87
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:11,798
You can't do that. Look
what you've created here.

88
00:15:11,918 --> 00:15:13,622
It's like nerdvana.

89
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:20,005
More importantly,
you have a Darth Vader voice changer?

90
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,019
Not for long.

91
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:24,827
I call dibs on <i>The Golden Age Flash</i>.

92
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:27,588
I need that to complete my
<i>Justice Society of America</i> collection.

93
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,041
- Too bad. I called dibs.
- You can't just call dibs.

94
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,642
I can and I did.
Look up "Dibs" in Wikipedia.

95
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:35,244
Dibs doesn't apply
in a bidding war.

96
00:15:35,364 --> 00:15:36,771
It's not a bidding war.

97
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,358
I'm selling it all to Larry
down at the comic book store.

98
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:42,028
- Did Larry call dibs?
- Will you forget dibs?!

99
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:44,473
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

100
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,422
- What's the number? I'll match it.
- I'll match it plus a thousand rupees.

101
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,983
- What's the exchange rate?
- None of your business.

102
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,496
Take it or leave it?

103
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,187
Mom? My bar mitzvah bonds.
How much do I got?

104
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,453
Thanks.

105
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:59,016
I can go $2,600 and two trees in Israel.

106
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:02,373
Forget it, guys.

107
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,361
If I sell to one of you, the other two
are going to be really mad at me.

108
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:07,771
Who cares? As long as you pick me!

109
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,798
Okay, Leonard, put down the box.
Let's talk.

110
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:12,843
Sorry, Raj. My mind is made up.

111
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:13,951
No!

112
00:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,312
I can't let you do this.

113
00:16:16,877 --> 00:16:18,355
Get out of my way.

114
00:16:21,993 --> 00:16:24,154
None shall pass!

115
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,868
I did not want to do this,

116
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:34,414
but I have here the rare mint
condition production error

117
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,798
<i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>
Geordi La Forge

118
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:39,376
without his visor
in the original packaging.

119
00:16:40,102 --> 00:16:42,035
If you do not get out of my way,

120
00:16:42,646 --> 00:16:43,908
I will open it.

121
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,048
Okay, man. Be cool.

122
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,595
We're all friends here.

123
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,473
What the hell's going on?

124
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,133
You hypocrite!

125
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:55,499
What?

126
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,974
Little Miss "grown-ups
don't play with toys."

127
00:16:58,094 --> 00:17:01,648
If I were to go into that apartment now,
would I not find Beanie Babies?

128
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,638
Are you not an accumulator
of Care Bears and My Little Ponies?

129
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:07,779
And who is that Japanese feline
I see frolicking on your shorts?

130
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,104
Hello, Hello Kitty!

131
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:16,744
Okay, look, if this is about yesterday,
Leonard,

132
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,457
I am really sorry about what I said.
I was just upset.

133
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,650
- I need to hear it.
- No, you didn't. You are a great guy

134
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,664
and it is the things you love
that make you who you are.

135
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:28,895
I guess that makes
me "large breasts."

136
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,335
Still, I think it's time for
me to get rid of this stuff

137
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,526
and, you know,
move on with my life.

138
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:40,872
- Really?
- Yeah.

139
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:44,445
Well, good for you.

140
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:46,536
Thanks.

141
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:51,199
Do you want to...
I don't know, later...

142
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,385
Excuse me.

143
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,545
- Hey, Penny.
- Hi, Mike.

144
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,606
- Ready to go?
- I just have to change.

145
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:59,025
- I'll give you a hand.
- Stop it!

146
00:17:59,368 --> 00:18:00,289
Bye, guys.

147
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,232
My turn on the time machine!

148
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,145
It worked.

149
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,532
It really worked.

150
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,481
They said I was mad, but it worked!

151
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,254
Not Morlocks!

152
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:50,857
Not flesh-eating Morlocks!

153
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:53,186
Help!

154
00:19:01,575 --> 00:19:03,627
Sheldon, are you okay?

155
00:19:04,302 --> 00:19:06,545
We have to get rid
of the time machine.

156
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:09,108
It is a little big
for the living room, isn't it?

157
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,401
Yeah, that's the problem. It's too big.

158
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,904
I'm glad you agree.
I hired some guys to help us move it.

159
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:17,338
Come on in, fellas.

160
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:22,866
Morlocks!

161
00:19:23,102 --> 00:19:24,905
Eat him. Eat him.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
