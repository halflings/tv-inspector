1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:03,048
More details about
the new <i>Star Trek</i> film.

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:06,897
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,472
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:12,779
Oh, please.

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:16,274
For Vulcans, mating...
or if you will, PonFahr...

6
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:21,002
- it's an extremely private matter.
- Still, I'd like to know the details.

7
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,047
His mother was human.
His father is Vulcan.

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,832
- They couldn't just conceive.
- Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

9
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:27,944
Can you imagine Spock's Dad
in a little room

10
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,599
with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears.

11
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,829
How come on <i>Star Trek</i>
everybody's private parts are the same?

12
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,533
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,737
Hi. Can you help me?

14
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:46,119
I was writing an e-mail
and the "A" key got stuck.

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,960
Now it's just going "Aaa..."

16
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:51,263
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

17
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,305
Diet Coke.

18
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,202
And yogurt.

19
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:58,269
And a little nail polish.

20
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,896
I'll take a look at it.

21
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,130
Gentlemen,
switching to local nerd news...

22
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,157
Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team

23
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:08,154
in the university Physics Bowl
this year.

24
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:09,655
You're kidding. Why not?

25
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:12,252
They formed a barbershop quartet
and got a gig

26
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,145
playing Knott's Berry Farm.

27
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,234
So, in your world,

28
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,462
you're like the cool guys.

29
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:21,885
Recognize.

30
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:26,321
This is our year.
With those guys out,

31
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,549
the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

32
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:30,047
Zod?

33
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,886
Kryptonian villain. Long story.

34
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,087
Good story.

35
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,976
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

36
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:42,355
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

37
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:45,388
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

38
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,896
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

39
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:52,559
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

40
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:57,040
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,288
By that reasoning we should also
play Bridge, hold up a chuppah

42
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,838
and enter the Olympic
bobsled competition.

43
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,253
Tickets to that, please.

44
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,174
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

45
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,468
No, don't.

46
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,054
"The needs of the many...

47
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,221
"... outweigh the needs of the few.

48
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,445
"Or the one."

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,937
Damn it, I'll do it.

50
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:24,052
Episode 113:
The Bat Jar Conjecture

51
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:27,136
Transcript: swsub.com

52
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,629
First order of Physics Bowl business.

53
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,841
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

54
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,618
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

55
00:02:55,824 --> 00:02:59,683
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads-up for the ladies.

56
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,309
The ladies?

57
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,545
"Perpetual Motion Squad...
we can go all night."

58
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,267
- I like it.
- I don't.

59
00:03:07,778 --> 00:03:10,264
Teams are traditionally
named after fierce creatures,

60
00:03:10,384 --> 00:03:12,403
thus intimidating one's opponent.

61
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:15,274
- Then we could be the Bengal tigers.
- Poor choice.

62
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:17,444
Gram for gram,
no animal exceeds

63
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,181
the relative fighting strength
of the army ant.

64
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:22,062
Maybe so,

65
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:25,292
but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger
with a magnifying glass.

66
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,867
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor...

67
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,006
Point of order.

68
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,675
I move that any vote on team names
must be unanimous.

69
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:37,441
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger

70
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,333
when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

71
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:44,337
Will the gentleman from the great
State of Denial yield for a question?

72
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,113
I will yield.

73
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,116
After we go through the exercise
of an annoying series of votes,

74
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:52,267
all of which the gentleman will lose,
does he then intend to threaten to quit

75
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,219
- if he does not get his way?
- He does.

76
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:56,705
I move we are the Army Ants.
All those in favor?

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,329
Good afternoon, and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

78
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,178
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host

79
00:04:04,298 --> 00:04:06,515
because apparently
I didn't have anything else to do

80
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,906
on a Saturday afternoon,
and isn't that just a little sad?

81
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:13,088
Gentlemen, ready?

82
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,633
- Yes.
- Fire away.

83
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:16,778
It's none of my business,
but isn't a guy

84
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:19,505
who can't speak in front of women
gonna hold you back a little?

85
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,197
He'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

86
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:25,577
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

87
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,271
Thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

88
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:31,608
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

89
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:35,053
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

90
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:37,322
"What is the shortest
light pulse ever produced?"

91
00:04:38,274 --> 00:04:39,841
- Dr. Cooper.
- And of course,

92
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,660
the answer is 130 attoseconds.

93
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:43,870
- That is correct.
- I knew that, too.

94
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:47,606
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question:

95
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:49,520
"What is the quantum mechanical effect

96
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,753
"used to encode data
on hard-disk drives?"

97
00:04:53,472 --> 00:04:55,923
And of course the answer is
giant magnetoresistance.

98
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,941
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

99
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,562
And I answered.
It's called teamwork.

100
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:05,030
Don't you think I should answer
the engineering questions?

101
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,338
I am an engineer.

102
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:09,164
By that logic I should answer
all the anthropology questions

103
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:10,715
because I'm a mammal.

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,943
Just ask another one.

105
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,668
"What artificial satellite
has seen glimpses

106
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,740
of Einstein's predicted
frame dragging?"

107
00:05:21,784 --> 00:05:24,000
And of course,
it's Gravity Probe B.

108
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:27,162
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

109
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:28,198
Why?

110
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:29,623
Because it's polite.

111
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:32,225
What do manners
have to do with it?

112
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,537
This is war.

113
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:37,056
Were the Romans polite
when they salted the ground of Carthage

114
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,208
to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

115
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,772
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

116
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,329
The objective of the competion
is to give correct answers.

117
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:49,474
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

118
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:52,107
Some of us might have
the correct answers, too.

119
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:54,382
Oh, please.
You don't even have a PhD.

120
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,777
- All right, that's it!
- Howard, sit down.

121
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,180
- Maybe we should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

122
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,485
All this button-pushing
is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.

123
00:06:06,988 --> 00:06:07,828
I agree.

124
00:06:08,191 --> 00:06:09,508
What did he say?

125
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:11,212
He compared Sheldon

126
00:06:11,332 --> 00:06:14,451
to a disposable feminine
cleansing product

127
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:16,709
one might use
on a summer's eve.

128
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,074
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

129
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:27,848
Leonard, excellent.
I want to show you something.

130
00:06:28,194 --> 00:06:29,865
Can it wait?
I need to talk to you.

131
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,363
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

132
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,873
The colors are based
on <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>.

133
00:06:36,109 --> 00:06:39,427
The three of you will wear Support Red,
and I will wear Command Gold.

134
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:42,731
Why do they say "AA"?

135
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:44,490
Army Ants.

136
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:49,654
Isn't that confusing? "AA" might mean
something else to certain people.

137
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,820
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

138
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:56,194
No, I meant...

139
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Never mind.

140
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
Check it out,

141
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,980
I got you a <i>Batman</i> cookie jar.

142
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,123
Oh, neat!
What's the occasion?

143
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:09,737
Well, you're a friend,
and you like <i>Batman</i>

144
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,093
and cookies,
and you're off the team.

145
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,711
What?

146
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,306
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

147
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,999
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did. I just came from there.

148
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,200
Okay, I don't know
where you just came from,

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,366
but it could'nt have been a team meeting
because I wasn't there.

150
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,335
Ergo, the team did not meet.

151
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:32,196
Okay, let me try it this way:

152
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:35,857
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends,

153
00:07:36,017 --> 00:07:39,264
and one thing led to another,
and it turns out you're off the team.

154
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:41,342
Why?

155
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,625
Because you're taking
all the fun out of it.

156
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,785
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics
Bowl the team that has the most fun?

157
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:49,675
Okay, let me try it this way:

158
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:53,048
You're annoying and no one
wants to play with you anymore.

159
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,293
I see.

160
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,725
At this point I should inform you

161
00:08:01,162 --> 00:08:03,402
that I intend to form my own team

162
00:08:03,562 --> 00:08:06,903
and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together

163
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,044
and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

164
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,489
Thanks for the heads-up.

165
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,248
You're welcome.

166
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:19,419
- One more thing.
- Yes?

167
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:20,858
It's on, bitch.

168
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:31,464
- So who'd he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

169
00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:34,983
He just smiles and eats
macaroons out of his bat jar.

170
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,020
He's using psychological warfare.

171
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:41,971
We must reply in kind.
I say we wait until he looks at us,

172
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:45,669
then laugh like, "Yes, you are
a smart and strong competitor,

173
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,618
"but we are also smart and strong,

174
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,469
and we have a reasonable
chance of defeating you."

175
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,237
How exactly would that laugh go?

176
00:08:59,531 --> 00:09:02,429
That sounds more like,
"We are a tall, thin woman

177
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,128
who wants to make a
coat out of your Dalmatians."

178
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,844
Let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

179
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:11,897
So?

180
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,674
So nothing.
Let's destroy him.

181
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,061
Gentlemen.

182
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:27,604
We're going to need
a strong fourth for our team.

183
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,566
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played <i>TV's Blossom</i>.

184
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:35,577
She got a PhD. in neuroscience
or something.

185
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:39,584
Raj, we're not getting <i>TV's Blossom</i>
to join our Physics Bowl team.

186
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,870
How about the girl
from <i>The Wonder Years</i>?

187
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:49,251
Gentlemen, I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.

188
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:53,367
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

189
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,344
Why? Because you slept together,
and when she was done with you

190
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,992
she discarded you
like last night's chutney?

191
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:03,937
Yes.

192
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:07,157
Sometimes you've got
to take one for the team.

193
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:08,876
Sack up, dude.

194
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:11,493
Fine.

195
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,547
Here I go, taking one for the team...

196
00:10:15,888 --> 00:10:16,991
in the sack.

197
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,416
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

198
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,960
So, Leslie,
I have a question for you,

199
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:29,093
and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

200
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:30,630
Hit that thing.

201
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:36,429
Leonard, there's no reason
to feel uncomfortable

202
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,471
just because we've seen
each other's faces

203
00:10:38,591 --> 00:10:41,645
and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

204
00:10:43,124 --> 00:10:44,115
There's not?

205
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,807
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds
like there should be.

206
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,314
Rest assured that any aspects
of our sexual relationship

207
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,773
regarding your preferences,
your idiosyncrasies, your performance

208
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,801
are still protected by the inherent
confidentiality of the bedroom.

209
00:10:56,921 --> 00:10:58,764
That's all very comforting,
but if it's okay,

210
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,874
I'd like to get on
to my question now.

211
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:02,283
Proceed.

212
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:06,157
We are entering the Physics Bowl,
and we need a fourth for our team.

213
00:11:06,277 --> 00:11:09,798
No, thanks. I'm really busy with my
like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search.

214
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,177
Dilepton, shmylepton.
We need you.

215
00:11:13,646 --> 00:11:14,506
Sorry.

216
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:17,197
Well, we tried.

217
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:21,102
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano
y mano y mano a mano.

218
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:24,270
Wait, you're going up
against Sheldon Cooper?

219
00:11:25,473 --> 00:11:28,374
That arrogant, misogynistic,
East Texas doorknob

220
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:31,189
that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles

221
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:33,570
for laundry and childbearing?

222
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:37,654
She's in.

223
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,056
So, how do you feel?

224
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,542
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

225
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,168
Are you ready?

226
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,672
Yeah. You know, you don't have
to stay for the whole thing.

227
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,593
Oh, no. I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

228
00:12:01,544 --> 00:12:02,423
Gentlemen.

229
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,747
I'm just gonna sit down.

230
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,324
So, is that your team?

231
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,227
Actually, I don't need a team.

232
00:12:20,347 --> 00:12:22,244
I could easily defeat you
single-handedly,

233
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:24,204
but the rules require four.

234
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:27,362
So, may I introduce
the third-floor janitor,

235
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:30,360
the lady from the lunch room,
and my Spanish is not good...

236
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,294
either her son or her butcher.

237
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,911
And what about your team?

238
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:37,977
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

239
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:39,191
Hello, Sheldon.

240
00:12:42,724 --> 00:12:43,767
Leslie Winkle.

241
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,534
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question,

242
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:49,355
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

243
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:54,693
Well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

244
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:57,588
So whatever verbal projectile
you launch in my direction

245
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,311
is reflected off of me,
returns on its original trajectory

246
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,656
and adheres to you.

247
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,007
Oh, ouch!

248
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:07,916
Okay, if everyone could
please take your seats.

249
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:17,273
Here's your T-shirt.

250
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:21,826
PMS?

251
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:24,125
It's a couple days early...

252
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:29,061
It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad."

253
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:31,119
Of course.
What was I thinking?

254
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,562
Good afternoon, everyone,

255
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:37,600
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!

256
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:43,158
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams.

257
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:45,954
AA versus...

258
00:13:47,115 --> 00:13:48,055
PMS.

259
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:50,178
All night long, y'all!

260
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:59,174
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question for ten points:

261
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,288
"What is the iso-spin singlet partner

262
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,054
"of the pi-zero meson?"

263
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:05,932
PMS?

264
00:14:06,093 --> 00:14:07,631
- The eta meson.
- Correct.

265
00:14:10,306 --> 00:14:12,128
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

266
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:14,816
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

267
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:18,305
Denied.
All right, for ten points,

268
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:20,875
"What is the lightest element on Earth

269
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:22,741
"with no stable isotope?"

270
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:23,887
AA?

271
00:14:24,007 --> 00:14:25,909
And of course,
the answer is technetium.

272
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:26,869
Terrific.

273
00:14:28,156 --> 00:14:29,205
Next question:

274
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,917
"What is the force between
two uncharged plates

275
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,251
"due to quantum vacuum fluctuations?"

276
00:14:34,727 --> 00:14:35,544
PMS?

277
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:38,189
Sheldon can suck on...
the Casimir effect.

278
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,187
Correct.

279
00:14:44,461 --> 00:14:47,900
How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?

280
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:49,309
PMS?

281
00:14:49,469 --> 00:14:51,183
- Shor's algorithm.
- Correct!

282
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:58,317
4.1855 times ten
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

283
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,542
Prevost's theory of exchanges.

284
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,226
Lambda equals one
over pi r squared n.

285
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,407
760 degrees Celsius...

286
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:08,431
the approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

287
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:11,623
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

288
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:14,525
A sigma particle.

289
00:15:14,923 --> 00:15:18,254
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

290
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,214
Correct!

291
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:28,597
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

292
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:32,767
The score now stands.
AA: 1,150,

293
00:15:32,887 --> 00:15:36,022
PMS: 1,175.

294
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:39,674
So, for 100 points and the match,

295
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:43,744
please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

296
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,074
Solve the equation.

297
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,010
Holy crap.

298
00:15:51,032 --> 00:15:52,289
What the hell is that?

299
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,125
Looks like something
they found on the ship at Roswell.

300
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:58,420
Come on. Think.
Leslie?

301
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:01,464
It's not gonna work if you rush me.
You have to let me get there.

302
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,966
You are never gonna
let that go, are you?

303
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:05,343
Ten seconds.

304
00:16:09,496 --> 00:16:10,390
PMS?

305
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,785
Sorry, I panicked.

306
00:16:15,388 --> 00:16:16,604
Then guess.

307
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,281
Eight.

308
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,149
.4

309
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,476
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

310
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:30,661
AA,

311
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,747
if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

312
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:38,123
He doesn't have it.

313
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:39,842
He's got squat.

314
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:51,092
AA, I need your answer.

315
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:55,896
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

316
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,853
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

317
00:16:58,015 --> 00:17:00,232
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

318
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,771
Winning Physics Bowl.

319
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,771
How do you know anything
about physics?

320
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,323
Here I am janitor.

321
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,366
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

322
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:12,660
Leningrad Politechnika.

323
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:14,703
Go Polar Bears.

324
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:19,482
That's a delightful little story,

325
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:22,106
but our arrangement was that
you sit here and not say anything...

326
00:17:22,226 --> 00:17:25,179
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

327
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:28,321
Look, now, maybe you have
democracy now in your beloved Russia,

328
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,301
but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

329
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,154
AA, I need your official answer.

330
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,434
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

331
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:39,604
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

332
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,147
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

333
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:42,773
Informal protest.

334
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,359
Denied.

335
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:48,404
- I need your official answer.
- No. I decline to provide one.

336
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:51,907
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

337
00:17:53,393 --> 00:17:54,963
That's your opinion.

338
00:17:57,945 --> 00:18:00,542
- The winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

339
00:18:02,008 --> 00:18:05,677
Is proving that you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important

340
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:09,174
that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

341
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:12,636
I don't understand the question.

342
00:18:14,098 --> 00:18:16,557
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

343
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,798
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

344
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:56,515
Who?

345
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,897
My Physics Bowl trophy.

346
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,814
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

347
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:07,144
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

348
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:09,568
My Physics Bowl trophy.

349
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:12,322
Leonard is so smart.

350
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,783
- Sheldon who?
- All right, that is very immature.

351
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,373
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm not!

352
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:23,285
- Okay, new contest.
- What are you doing?

353
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:25,739
I am settling once and for all

354
00:19:25,859 --> 00:19:28,574
who is the smartest around here, okay?

355
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,002
- Ready?
- Absolutely.

356
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:31,174
Bring it on.

357
00:19:31,806 --> 00:19:34,423
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy
were the three daughters

358
00:19:34,543 --> 00:19:35,971
"in what TV family?"

359
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,517
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

360
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,275
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

361
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,314
<i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

362
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,118
<i>Van Halen.</i>

363
00:19:59,654 --> 00:20:02,289
"Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

364
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:06,799
Oh, my God! Sean Penn!

365
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,932
How do you know these things?

366
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:12,631
I go outside,
and I talk to people.

367
00:20:14,494 --> 00:20:17,025
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record

368
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,681
"for being named <i>People Magazine</i>'s
Sexiest Man Alive?"

369
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,683
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

370
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,077
I don't think it's Shatner.

371
00:20:26,432 --> 00:20:28,339
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.

372
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:33,694
Formal protest.

373
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:38,116
"Singer who sang,
<i>Oops, I Did It Again</i>?"

374
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:49,085
"Tweetie Bird tought
he taw a what?"

375
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,149
Romulan.

376
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,532
Yes.

377
00:20:59,652 --> 00:21:01,887
He tought he taw a Romulan.
