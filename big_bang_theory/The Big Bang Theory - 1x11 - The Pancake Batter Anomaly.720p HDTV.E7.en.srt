1
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,200
Checkmate.

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,000
- Again?
- Obviously,

3
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,900
you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,100
Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land
would be more your speed.

5
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,900
Just reset the board.

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.

7
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,200
Hey, guys.

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
- Did you get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,200
- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than North Dakota.

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,600
I guess that joke's
only funny in Nebraska.

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,600
From the data at hand,
you really can't draw that conclusion.

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,400
All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,200
Boy, it's good to be back.

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,600
- How's your family?
- It was the worst trip.

15
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,400
Everyone got sick over the weekend.

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,000
- Sick?
- Here we go.

17
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,400
What kind of sick?

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
The flu, I guess.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
I don't need you to guess.
I need you to know.

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,900
Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,100
Maybe Friday.

22
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,400
Friday.
Was that morning or afternoon?

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,400
I- I don't...

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Think, woman.
Who blew their nose and when?

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,900
Sheldon, relax.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
She doesn't have any symptoms.
I'm sure she's not contagious.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, please.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,200
If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear,

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,200
it would have died out
thousands of years ago.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting,

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,000
homo habilis would have figured out
how to kill the guy with the runny nose.

32
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,200
Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,700
It's okay. I understand.

34
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,500
Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,000
You'd better go before he starts
spraying you with Lysol.

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Okay. Well, thank you
for getting my mail.

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,200
No problem. Welcome home.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,300
What?!

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,800
Season 1 Episode 11:
The Pancake Batter Anomaly

1
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,200
What the hell are you doing?

2
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,300
I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

3
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
With lime Jell-O?

4
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,500
I need a growth medium,

5
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,100
and someone polished off
the apricot yogurt.

6
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
Here,
swab my throat.

7
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,200
I don't think so.

8
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,400
If I'm going to get ahead of this thing,

9
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,200
I need to find out what's
growing in my throat.

10
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,700
Sheldon, you are not sick.

11
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,700
This is, but you are not.

12
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,800
We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid
she has introduced into our environment.

13
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
For having never been to Nebraska,

14
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm fairly certain that
I have no corn-husking antibodies.

15
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,900
Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

16
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,600
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me,

17
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,900
these Jell-O cultures
and my accompanying notes

18
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,200
will give them a fighting chance.

19
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
- I'm going back to bed.
- Wait.

20
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,400
- Put this in the bathroom.
- What for?

21
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
I need to measure my fluid
intake and output

22
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,100
to make sure my kidneys
aren't shutting down.

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I mixed pancake batter in this!

24
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,500
No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

25
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,900
You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment

26
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
including the label maker,

27
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,200
but you didn't have ten seconds
to make one that said "urine cup"?

28
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
It's right here on the bottom.

29
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,500
I guess I owe the Betty Crocker
Company a letter of apology.

30
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,500
Oh, dear God.

31
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,600
Leonard, I'm sick!

32
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,000
Leonard, I'm sick!

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Leonard, my comforter fell down,
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

34
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,600
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Leonard, where are you?

35
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm at work.

36
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,100
At 6:30 in the morning?

37
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
On Sunday?

38
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
- Why?
- They asked me to come in.

39
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,400
I didn't hear the phone ring.

40
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
They texted me.

41
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,500
Well, as I predicted,
I am sick.

42
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,200
My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2:00 a.m.,

43
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,200
and I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.

44
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
No kidding?

45
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,700
<i>No, not only that,</i>

46
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,700
it has shifted from clear
to milky green.

47
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,700
<i>All right,</i>

48
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,100
get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

49
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
What else would I drink,
gases, solids, ionized plasma?

50
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,000
Drink whatever you want.

51
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,500
- I want soup.
- Then make soup.

52
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,900
We don't have soup.

53
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm at work, Sheldon.

54
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,700
Is that a dog?

55
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,000
In the lab?

56
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge

57
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,600
for when they need dogs to...

58
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,900
operate the centrifuge

59
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,500
for blind scientists.
I have to go.

60
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Howard, it's the phone!

61
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,600
I know it's the phone, Ma,
I hear the phone!

62
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,100
Well, who's calling
at this ungodly hour?!

63
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,800
I don't know!

64
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour!

65
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,700
How can I ask them
when I'm talking to you?!

66
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
Hello.

67
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,700
It's Leonard.
Code milky green.

68
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,600
Dear Lord, not milky green.

69
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
Affirmative. With fever.

70
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Who's
on the phone?!

71
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,700
It's Leonard!

72
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,600
Why is he calling?!

73
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Sheldon's sick!

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,200
Were you playing with him?!

75
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,500
For God's sake, Ma,
I'm 26 years old!

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,100
Excuse me,
Mr. Grownup!

77
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,200
What do you want for breakfast?!

78
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
Chocolate milk and Eggos,
please!

79
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,400
- <i>Listen to me.</i>
- Hang on. Call waiting.

80
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,600
<i>No, don't...!</i>

81
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,100
Hello.

82
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Howard, I'm sick.

83
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,400
Howard's sleeping.
This is his mother!

84
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,300
Why are you calling
at this ungodly hour?

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,200
I need soup.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,200
Then call your own mother!

87
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
It was Sheldon.

88
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,700
- I tried to stop you.
- <i>It's my own fault.</i>

89
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,700
I forgot the protocol we put in place
after The Great Ear Infection of '06.

90
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,800
Call Koothrappali.

91
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,400
We need to find a place to lay low
for the next 18 to 24 hours.

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Stand by.

93
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,600
Ma, can my friends come over?

94
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,900
I just had
the carpet steamed!

95
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,900
That's a negatory.

96
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,300
But there's a <i>Planet of The Apes</i>
marathon at the NuArt today.

97
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Five movies, two hours apiece..

98
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,000
it's a start.

99
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Homeless, crazy guy at table 18.

100
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
No, just crazy.

101
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,400
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm sick.
Thank you very much.

103
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,500
How could you have gotten if from me?
I'm not sick.

104
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,900
You're a carrier.

105
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
All these people here are doomed.

106
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,700
You're doomed!

107
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,200
Sheldon, what do you want?

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,800
I want soup.

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,000
Why didn't you...?

110
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,100
Why didn't you just have soup at home?

111
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Penny, I have an IQ of 187.

112
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,700
Don't you imagine that
if there were a way for me

113
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
to have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

114
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,700
You can have soup delivered.

115
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
I did not think of that.

116
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Clearly, febrile delirium
is setting in.

117
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,500
Please bring me some soup

118
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,200
while I still understand
what a spoon is for.

119
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,500
What kind of soup do you want?

120
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,500
Well, my mother used
to make me this split pea

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,300
with little frankfurter slices
and these homemade croutons.

122
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
We have chicken, tortilla
and potato leek.

123
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,700
Could I get any of those
with little frankfurter slices

124
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
and homemade croutons?

125
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,800
Then surprise me.

126
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,900
Would you call that
"moss green" or "forest green"?

127
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,600
Look at this.
Everyone went chimp.

128
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,100
I'd like to point out
that I voted for orangutan,

129
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,900
but you shouted me down.

130
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
- Hi, Penny.
- Hey, where are you?

131
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,300
I'm... at work.

132
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,700
You sound funny.

133
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,000
Look. I'm...
I'm in a radiation suit.

134
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,900
- What's up?
- I'm at work, too,

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,100
and you'll never guess who's here
infecting my entire station.

136
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.

137
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,500
- Just tell him to go home.
- <i>He won't leave.</i>

138
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,400
He's afraid he'll pass out on the bus,
and someone will harvest his organs.

139
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,200
He's paranoid,
and he's established a nest.

140
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,800
Can you please come get him?

141
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

142
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,400
Oh, my God, there's a breach
in the radiation unit!

143
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
The whole city is in jeopardy!
Oh, my God!

144
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,400
The containment vessel's melting.
Gotta go. Bye!

145
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,200
I feel really guilty.

146
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,200
You did what you had to do.

147
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,000
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn,

148
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
you damn dirty ape!

149
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Thanks for bringing me home.

150
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,100
It's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.

151
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

152
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,400
Good, good.

153
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,400
Okay, well, you feel better.

154
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Wait!
Where are you going?

155
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,100
Home...
to write some bad checks.

156
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,300
You're going to leave me?

157
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,600
Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?

158
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,400
Of course, but not by myself.

159
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Really? Never?

160
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, once, when I was 15,

161
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
spending the summer at the Heidelberg
Institute in Germany.

162
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Studying abroad?

163
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
No. Visiting professor.

164
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Anyway, the local cuisine was
a little more sausage-based

165
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,000
than I'm used to, and the result
was an internal Blitzkrieg,

166
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
with my lower intestine playing
the part of Czechoslovakia.

167
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,200
And there was no one there
to take care of you?

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,400
My Mom had to fly
back to Texas to help my Dad,

169
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,000
because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

170
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
- Again?
- It was tornado season.

171
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,300
And it was an aluminum house.

172
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,700
The housekeeper in the faculty residence
didn't speak any English.

173
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,300
When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick,

174
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,100
she said, "Möchtest du
eine Darmspülung?"

175
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,700
What does that mean?

176
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,900
Based on what happened next,
I assume it means,

177
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
"Would you like an enema?"

178
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,400
Okay, sweetie.
I'll take care of you.

179
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,000
What do you need?

180
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,900
My Mom used to give me sponge baths.

181
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,100
Okay, ground rules: no sponge baths,

182
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
and definitely no enemas.

183
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,100
Agreed.

184
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,300
Here we go.

185
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,200
Ten-and-a-half hours of ape-y goodness.

186
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,900
Damn it, my glasses.

187
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?

188
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,300
- Sorry.
- Okay.

189
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,000
Found them.

190
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,900
Oh, great.

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,900
I'm sorry.
Don't you have a spare?

192
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, at home.

193
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,200
If you leave now,

194
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,100
you can be back before the gorillas
rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,700
Unless Sheldon's there,
in which case, you'll be trapped forever

196
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,200
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

197
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Hi. Penny?

198
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

199
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,400
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

200
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

201
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,100
He's home.
I'm screwed.

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,800
Ten-and-a-half hours
of ape-y blurriness.

203
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
How about Lasik?

204
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
You want me to get eye surgery?

205
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Would you rather go home
and deal with Sheldon,

206
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,700
or have a stranger carve out
your corneas with a laser beam?

207
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,900
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

208
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,700
Okay, nice and cozy.

209
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,900
Okay? I'll see you later.

210
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,900
Wait.

211
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
Will you please
rub this on my chest?

212
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,200
Sheldon,
can't you do that yourself?

213
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,000
VapoRub makes
my hands smell funny.

214
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,200
- But, Sheldon...
- Please, please, please?

215
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,600
I can't believe I'm doing this.

216
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,900
No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

217
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
Sorry.

218
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?

219
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,400
What?

220
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,000
My Mom used to sing it
to me when I was sick.

221
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,200
- Oh, sorry, honey. I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.

222
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,500
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty,</i>

223
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

224
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,700
<i>Happy kitty, sleepy kitty,</i>

225
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,500
<i>purr, purr, purr</i>

226
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Now you.

227
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
<i>Soft kitty,</i>

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
<i>Warm kitty...</i>

229
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,300
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

230
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,300
Keep rubbing.

231
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,000
<i>Little ball of fur</i>

232
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,700
What do you see? I can't.

233
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,500
The living room appears to be empty.

234
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,200
He must be in his bedroom.

235
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,400
My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser,

236
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,000
next to my bat signal.

237
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm not going in there.

238
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,100
- Raj?
- No way, Jose.

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,700
But I can't do it.
I can't see anything.

240
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
It's all right. Wireless minicam
and Bluetooth headset.

241
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,100
We'll be your eyes.

242
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,000
Fine.

243
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,600
One more thing.

244
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,400
This is a subsonic impact sensor.

245
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,800
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk,

246
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,400
this device will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

247
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,900
At that point,
based on the geography of the apartment

248
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
and the ambulatory speed
of a sick Sheldon,

249
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,000
you'll have 7 seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

250
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,000
Won't my footsteps set it off?

251
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,700
No. You'll be on
your hands and knees.

252
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,500
You'll need to get the sensor
as close as you can to Sheldon's room.

253
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

254
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Stay low.

255
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,700
Bear left.

256
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,300
- Now keep true.
- What?

257
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,700
- It means "go straight."
- Then just say, "Go straight."

258
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
You don't say, "Go straight."

259
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,000
When you're giving bearings,
you say, "Keep true."

260
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,900
All right.

261
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,500
I just hit my head.

262
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,100
Because you didn't keep true.

263
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,300
<i>Okay, turn right.</i>

264
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
The picture's breaking up.

265
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,500
Angle your head to the right.

266
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>Now, a little more.</i>

267
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
Little more.

268
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,000
That's it.
Now, just keep true.

269
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,800
You're close enough to Sheldon's room.
Deploy the sensor.

270
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,800
<i>Now, turn it on.</i>

271
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,700
It wasn't on?

272
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,800
Then why did I have to crawl?

273
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
No, I guess you didn't.

274
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,900
<i>Okay, it's on.</i>

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

276
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
I know.

277
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,700
Hang on, the sensor's picking up
something. Turn your head back.

278
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,700
You rat bastard.

279
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,100
Told you the sensor would work.

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,100
You deliberately stuck me
with Sheldon.

281
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,900
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like?

282
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Penny, I'm hungry.

283
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,600
It's okay, sweetie.
Good news! Leonard's home!

284
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,100
Here you go.
Good luck. Bye.

285
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Leonard! I'm hungry!

286
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,500
Penny, take me with you!

287
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,300
I want grilled cheese.

288
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

289
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,900
I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

290
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
I'm very congested.

291
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah? So?

292
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,700
Could you go to the kitchen

293
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,600
and get me the turkey baster
labeled "mucous"?

294
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
If I stand, I'll vomit.

295
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,100
Under the sink,
yellow Tupper Ware bowl.
