1
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:03,479
Okay.

2
00:00:04,354 --> 00:00:06,322
The X Tens are online.

3
00:00:06,489 --> 00:00:12,450
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:16,087
...racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

5
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,599
...bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,897
Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...

7
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:24,973
...terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia...

8
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:28,804
...and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP...

9
00:00:28,978 --> 00:00:31,173
...and the external receiver attached
to this...

10
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:33,614
...lamp.

11
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,247
Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

12
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,322
- Are we ready on the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

13
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,541
- Hey, guys.
Hello.

14
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:07,179
It's a little loud.

15
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,580
No problem. Turning it down.

16
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,881
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax:

17
00:01:13,056 --> 00:01:14,489
Voilà.

18
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,681
Okay, thanks.

19
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,350
Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?

20
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:20,960
Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.

21
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:26,034
No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

22
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:29,364
Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at RadioShack.

23
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,131
They're really cheap.

24
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:33,002
No. You don't get it.

25
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,701
Howard, enable public access.

26
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,369
Public access enabled.

27
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:43,642
- Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.
- No, hang on.

28
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,149
See?

29
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,758
No.

30
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:53,225
Someone in Sichuan Province, China...

31
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:57,162
...is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,668
Huh. Well, that's handy.

33
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,771
Um, here's a question. Why?

34
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,035
Because we can.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,176
Oh! They found the remote-control cars.

36
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,851
- But wait, wait, what's on top of them?
- Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

37
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:19,315
The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...

38
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,357
...and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

39
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,696
You may wanna put on slacks.

40
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,126
What?

41
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:35,198
Ew! Stop it. No. Leave me alone.

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,803
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

43
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:08,767
You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...

44
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,465
...we're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.

45
00:03:13,543 --> 00:03:17,980
I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

46
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,672
Eight feet tall and ripped.

47
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:25,953
I'm with you. I just have to make sure
if I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.

48
00:03:27,824 --> 00:03:29,655
I promised my mother.

49
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,830
I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.

50
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,233
That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.

51
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,037
Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.

52
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,566
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

53
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,575
Well, there's always the possibility...

54
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:52,579
...that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

55
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:56,618
...but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

56
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:59,050
It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.

57
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:02,419
They want us to present
our paper on the properties of supersolids...

58
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,254
...at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.

59
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:08,420
I know. I read it before I threw it out.

60
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:11,362
Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

61
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:12,831
...why did you throw it out?

62
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:16,870
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...

63
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,304
...in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...

64
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:23,536
...who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

65
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:26,181
Which, if I were there, it would be.

66
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:27,907
I don't know, Sheldon.

67
00:04:28,084 --> 00:04:31,884
Those Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein
Condensates parties are legendary.

68
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:33,386
Forget the parties.

69
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,525
Forget the parties? What a nerd.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,954
Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?

71
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:43,064
Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?

72
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:46,724
Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...

73
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:51,533
...is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

74
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,110
Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.

75
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:00,379
I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed...

76
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,313
Shut up, Howard.

77
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,049
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

78
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,416
We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

79
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,218
...and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

80
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,384
Everything else is optional.

81
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,655
Okay, let me put it this way: I'm doing it.

82
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,890
You can't. I'm the lead author.

83
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,866
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

84
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,937
I let you think we went alphabetically...

85
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:25,904
...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

86
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:29,567
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

87
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:31,310
You're welcome.

88
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:34,917
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

89
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,483
It doesn't need proving.

90
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:40,418
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

91
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,320
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

92
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,721
I don't care what you say.

93
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:47,328
I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

94
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:48,657
And I forbid it.

95
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,427
You forbid it?

96
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,468
If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

97
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:59,233
- So you admit that it's our work?
- No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

98
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,037
And once again, you are welcome.

99
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:07,313
Oh, no, he didn't.

100
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:13,381
So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

101
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,548
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

102
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,718
...where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

103
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,490
<i>You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?</i>

104
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,998
Like: Bzz-phew!

105
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,794
Never mind.

106
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:31,137
How about this one?

107
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:34,299
It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy. "

108
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,569
Oh.

109
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,612
Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

110
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,341
They don't. That's why I saved this one.

111
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,151
Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

112
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,349
Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

113
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:52,994
...and these.
- Is this stuff you want me to try on?

114
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,858
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

115
00:06:56,032 --> 00:07:00,025
Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

116
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,300
What's this?

117
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:04,940
That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

118
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:06,932
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:07,777 --> 00:07:11,713
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

120
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:14,543
It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

121
00:07:14,717 --> 00:07:16,514
...and then rescued by Superman.

122
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,155
Oh, nice.

123
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:23,451
It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

124
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,859
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

125
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,692
- Great, be right back.
- Where are you going? Put them on.

126
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,700
- Here?
- Oh, are you shy?

127
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,100
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry, I won't look.

128
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:39,605
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth...

129
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,573
- Sweetie, put the pants on.
- I'm gonna put them on.

130
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,012
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

131
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:48,582
...on this presentation thing?

132
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,481
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

133
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:55,454
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

134
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,860
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

135
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,498
What is this?

136
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:05,759
Oh, careful.

137
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,831
<i>That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.</i>

138
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,166
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

139
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:15,401
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

140
00:08:17,947 --> 00:08:19,915
Okay, all right. Moving on.

141
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,243
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

142
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,249
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

143
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:29,413
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

144
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,259
Is this your only tie?

145
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,225
Ah, technically, yes.

146
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:38,993
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

147
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,968
So it works as two.

148
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,770
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

149
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,145
- Is this all your clothes?
- Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,313
The eighth grade?

151
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,278
My last growth spurt.

152
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:58,713
Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

153
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,015
- Great.
- Yup.

154
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,617
I said no. Put it down.

155
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,292
Hey, Sheldon.

156
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,533
Hello, Penny.

157
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,363
Get anything good?

158
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:21,968
<i>Just the latest copy
of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.</i>

159
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,472
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

160
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:32,512
It was a joke.

161
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:35,186
Heh-heh.

162
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:41,353
Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

163
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,629
To save you from further awkwardness...

164
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,600
...know that I'm comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

165
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:51,035
Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

166
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,840
Put it in your pocket.

167
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:02,650
- So you and Leonard...
- Oh, dear God.

168
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:04,714
Little misunderstanding, huh?

169
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,320
A little misunderstand...?

170
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:10,391
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

171
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,356
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

172
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,795
...and I think he feels really bad about it.

173
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,260
Huh.

174
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,630
Well, how do you feel?

175
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:24,402
I don't understand the question.

176
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,841
Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

177
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,775
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

178
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:35,007
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

179
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:38,517
...of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

180
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:39,945
Wait, what?

181
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:42,647
I couldn't poop this morning.

182
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:49,555
You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

183
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,792
- It's certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

184
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:55,163
A powerful laxative.

185
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:58,507
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

186
00:10:58,674 --> 00:11:00,437
I know Leonard values you as a friend.

187
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,509
He told me without your little idea...

188
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:06,114
...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

189
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:10,979
Excuse me. Little idea?

190
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:14,213
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it...

191
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,359
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

192
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,552
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words...

193
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,595
In what words, then, exactly?

194
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,255
The exact words aren't really...

195
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,799
- It's more the spirit in which...
- What did he say?

196
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:28,266
You had a lucky hunch.

197
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,436
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why...?

198
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,133
Don't you ever speak to me again.

199
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:38,404
What...?

200
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:42,142
Oh, he:

201
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,895
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

202
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:00,229
- Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch. "
- Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

203
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:02,030
- Why did you say it?
- I don't know...

204
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:05,002
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all.

205
00:12:05,174 --> 00:12:06,664
A little bit.

206
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,008
How did that work out for you?

207
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:10,406
Leonard, ready to go?

208
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,878
Libido, one. Truth, zero.

209
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,915
I'm gonna ask one more time.

210
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,782
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

211
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:24,892
And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

212
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,024
Let's go.

213
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,097
- Bye, Sheldon.
- Goodbye, Penny.

214
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:43,305
One of these days: Phew!

215
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:47,339
There you go.

216
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,416
You're right, this side does look better.

217
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:52,850
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

218
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:57,250
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

219
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:58,859
- You're kidding.
- Is that all?

220
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,021
All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

221
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,627
Oh. Well, then, good.

222
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,963
I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.

223
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:13,472
- It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
- Okay, joke. Okay.

224
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,077
How about this? Um, okay.

225
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,408
There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

226
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:21,049
...but they won't lay any eggs.

227
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,879
So he calls a physicist to help.

228
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:29,116
The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

229
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:34,888
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum. "

230
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,724
Right?

231
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,396
Oh, sorry, I just... I've heard it before.

232
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,366
- Let's roll.
- Okay.

233
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:50,205
- Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

234
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:54,010
I really should've brought my own car.

235
00:13:55,751 --> 00:14:00,154
So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

236
00:14:00,322 --> 00:14:03,758
...the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

237
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:08,761
...which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,558
Thank you.

239
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,969
- Are there any questions?
Yeah.

240
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,672
What the hell was that?

241
00:14:23,812 --> 00:14:25,006
Any other questions?

242
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:29,712
Dr. Sheldon Cooper here.
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

243
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,415
Thank you.

244
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,152
And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

245
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,226
...where I was walking through
the park...

246
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:41,659
...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

247
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,526
...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

248
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,760
...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

249
00:14:47,937 --> 00:14:50,599
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

250
00:14:50,773 --> 00:14:53,765
Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

251
00:14:53,943 --> 00:14:55,205
Was that just an anecdote?

252
00:14:55,377 --> 00:14:57,572
- You are not Isaac Newton.
- No, no, that's true.

253
00:14:57,746 --> 00:15:00,476
Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

254
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,241
You cannot be that arrogant.

255
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,046
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

256
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,156
If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

257
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,557
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

258
00:15:13,729 --> 00:15:16,061
- No offense.
- Really? So why did you come?

259
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,927
- Because I knew you'd screw this up.
- I didn't screw it up.

260
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:22,264
Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

261
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,702
- Thank you.
- It was straight downhill from there.

262
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,807
I've had enough of your condescension.

263
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,706
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

264
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:33,211
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

265
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:37,375
But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

266
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,877
No offense.

267
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,025
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

268
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,457
...and has an ego
in need of constant validation.

269
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:49,530
- So you admit you're an egotist.
- Yes.

270
00:15:50,432 --> 00:15:53,629
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

271
00:15:53,802 --> 00:15:56,066
...so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

272
00:15:56,238 --> 00:15:57,296
But he's worse!

273
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:58,997
Okay, that is it.

274
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:00,903
Stop it.

275
00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:05,270
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

276
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:07,415
Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

277
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,312
- Stop it.
- You hit me.

278
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,747
You saw that. He hit me.

279
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:13,217
- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.

280
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,482
It wasn't... It was not...
You are a nutcase.

281
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:18,991
We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.

282
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:20,890
Stop it. Stop it.

283
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:22,890
Quit it.

284
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,598
Is this usually
how these physics things go?

285
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,071
More often than you'd think.

286
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:37,238
Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

287
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,880
- No pinches. No...!
- No!

288
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,320
You could have offered me a ride home.

289
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,752
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

290
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,189
I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

291
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:00,858
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

292
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:03,664
You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

293
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,774
Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

294
00:17:07,142 --> 00:17:09,133
Excuse me.

295
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:12,212
Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

296
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,548
Yes. Ahem.

297
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:17,652
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

298
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,785
It was uncalled for.

299
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,448
You won't believe this.

300
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,889
Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

301
00:17:26,428 --> 00:17:27,827
What?

302
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,928
- Now, who would do that?
- That would be me.

303
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,464
Check it out. It's a featured video.

304
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,297
<i>You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.</i>

305
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,736
<i>- You tried to blow up my head.
- So it was working.</i>

306
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:41,432
<i>- It was not... You are a nutcase.
- We'll see about that.</i>

307
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,102
<i>You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.</i>

308
00:17:45,748 --> 00:17:49,411
<i>Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.</i>

309
00:17:51,854 --> 00:17:55,119
<i>- Hit you with a vulcan nerve pinch.
- No pinches. No...!</i>

310
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:58,158
<i>You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.</i>

311
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,352
Oh, jeez.

312
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,963
Does this suit really look that bad?

313
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:05,032
Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

314
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,725
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

315
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,203
Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

316
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:16,207
...why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

317
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:18,039
"Me and my girlfriend"?

318
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,578
Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

319
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,528
<i>- He hit me.
- You tried to blow up my head.</i>

320
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,323
<i>- So it was working.
- It was not... You are a nutcase.</i>

321
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,590
<i>We'll see about that.</i>
