1
00:00:00,928 --> 00:00:03,851
All right!
I'm moving my infantry division.

2
00:00:04,074 --> 00:00:07,186
Augmented by bataillon of orcs
from Lord of the Rings.

3
00:00:07,397 --> 00:00:08,994
We flank the Tennessee volunteers

4
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:12,082
and the North, once again,
wins the battle of Gettysburg.

5
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:13,608
Not so fast!

6
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:15,921
Remember, the South still has
two infantry divisions,

7
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:17,835
plus Superman and Godzilla.

8
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:21,798
No, orcs are magic. Superman
is vulnerable to magic.

9
00:00:21,884 --> 00:00:26,016
Not to mention you already lost Godzilla
to the Illinois cavalry and Hulk.

10
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:30,594
Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee
charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh?

11
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:32,832
- You guys ready to order?
- Hang on, honey.

12
00:00:33,009 --> 00:00:34,230
Shiva and Ganesh,

13
00:00:34,477 --> 00:00:36,780
the Hindu gods,
against the entire Union army?

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
And orcs.

15
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:39,952
I'll be back.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,347
Excuse me.

17
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:44,194
Ganesh is the Remover of Obstacles
and Shiva is the Destroyer.

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,988
When the smoke clears,
Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi

19
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,509
and drinking mint juleps.

20
00:00:49,176 --> 00:00:52,429
My boss says you have to either order
or leave and never come back.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,261
What do you recommend for someone
who worked up a man-sized appetite

22
00:00:56,465 --> 00:00:58,555
from a morning of weight training
and cardio funk?

23
00:00:58,734 --> 00:00:59,734
A shower.

24
00:01:00,837 --> 00:01:02,913
I'll take the Heart Smart platter.

25
00:01:03,727 --> 00:01:05,484
All right, thank you,
and Sheldon?

26
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:07,861
We don't eat here.
I don't know what's good.

27
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,638
- It's all good.
- Statistically unlikely.

28
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,748
Just get a hamburger.
You like hamburgers.

29
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,795
I like hamburgers
where we usually have them.

30
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:18,265
You can't make the assumption
that I'll like them here.

31
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:20,129
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:22,281
- Give him a hamburger.
- Which one?

33
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,301
The Classic Burger,
the Ranch House Burger,

34
00:01:24,438 --> 00:01:26,252
the Barbecue Burger,
or the Kobe Burger?

35
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,169
Can't we just go to Big Boy?

36
00:01:28,476 --> 00:01:31,026
They only have one burger...
the Big Boy.

37
00:01:31,537 --> 00:01:33,168
The Barbecue Burger's like the Big Boy.

38
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,732
Excuse me, in a world
that already includes a Big Boy,

39
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,999
why would I settle for
something like a Big Boy?

40
00:01:38,243 --> 00:01:40,133
Because you're not at Big Boy!

41
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:44,131
- Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.
- Make it two.

42
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,483
Waitresses don't yell at you
at Big Boy.

43
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:49,260
Hey, Leonard.
Hi, guys.

44
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:50,502
Hi, Leslie.

45
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:51,920
I didn't know you ate here.

46
00:01:52,056 --> 00:01:54,172
We don't.
This is a disturbing aberration.

47
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,663
Leslie, this is Penny.

48
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,683
She lives across the hall
from Sheldon and me.

49
00:01:57,816 --> 00:02:00,305
And walks in quiet beauty
like the night.

50
00:02:01,358 --> 00:02:03,250
Howard, I've asked you not to do that.

51
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,795
Leslie and I do research together
at the university.

52
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:09,159
Wow, a girl scientist.

53
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,554
Yep, come for the breasts,
stay for the brains.

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,232
Glad I ran into you.

55
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:16,781
The Physics Department string quartet
needs a new cellist.

56
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,291
What happened to Elliot Wong?

57
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,440
He switched over
to high-energy radiation research,

58
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,364
had a little mishap,
and now the other guys

59
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,197
are uncomfortable sitting next to him.

60
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:26,716
- You're in?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

61
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:29,206
Great, we rehearse
on Tuesdays at your place.

62
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,366
Why at my place?

63
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:33,822
Department of Energy said
our regular space is kind of a hot zone.

64
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,446
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you, too.

65
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,023
I didn't know you played the cello.

66
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:41,431
Yeah, my parents felt
that naming me Leonard

67
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,749
and putting me
in Advanced Placement classes

68
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:45,834
wasn't getting me beaten up enough.

69
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,462
If you're into music,
I happen to be a human beatbox.

70
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:50,585
Really?

71
00:02:57,507 --> 00:02:59,456
I'm actually not that into music.

72
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:01,740
Your friend's really cute.

73
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,412
Anything going on with you two?

74
00:03:04,132 --> 00:03:05,132
Leslie?

75
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,286
No, no.

76
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,729
- What, are you kidding?
- He asked her out once.

77
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,609
It was an embarrassing failure.

78
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,684
- Thank you, Sheldon.
- I'm sorry.

79
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,321
Was that supposed to be a secret?

80
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,658
That's too bad.
You guys'd make a cute couple.

81
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,014
Oh, dear.

82
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,311
- What's the matter?
- She didn't take my order.

83
00:03:23,484 --> 00:03:26,458
How can she take your order
when you're too neurotic to talk to her?

84
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,104
Nevertheless,
this will be reflected in her tip.

85
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:35,784
What did Penny mean,
"You'd make a cute couple?"

86
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:38,251
I assume she meant
the two of you together

87
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:41,614
would constitute a couple
that others might consider cute.

88
00:03:43,253 --> 00:03:45,471
An alternate and somewhat
less likely interpretation

89
00:03:45,664 --> 00:03:47,668
is that you could manufacture one.

90
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,927
As in, "Look, Leonard and Leslie
made Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb.

91
00:03:52,021 --> 00:03:53,213
Aren't they adorable?"

92
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,627
If Penny didn't know
that Leslie had turned me down,

93
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,248
then it would unambiguously mean

94
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,178
that she, Penny, thought
I should ask her, Leslie, out,

95
00:04:01,351 --> 00:04:04,323
indicating that she had no interest
in me asking her, Penny, out.

96
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,869
But, because she did know
that I had asked Leslie out

97
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,762
and that she, Leslie,
had turned me down, then she, Penny,

98
00:04:09,897 --> 00:04:11,769
could be offering consolation.

99
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,652
"That's too bad,
you would have made a cute couple,"

100
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:20,214
but while thinking: "Good,
Leonard remains available."

101
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,223
You're a lucky man, Leonard.

102
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,622
- How so?
- You're talking to one of the three men

103
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:32,461
in the Western hemisphere capable
of following that train of thought.

104
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:34,391
Well, what do you think?

105
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,131
I said I could follow it.
I didn't say I care.

106
00:04:58,443 --> 00:05:00,526
Subtitles: swsub.com

107
00:05:07,857 --> 00:05:09,589
I admire your fingering.

108
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:11,738
Thank you.

109
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:16,175
Maybe sometime you can try that
on my instrument.

110
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,844
- G'night, guys. Good job.
- Thanks.

111
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,445
See you next week.

112
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:31,608
- That was fun. Thanks for including me.
- You're welcome.

113
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:34,945
If you're up for it, we could practice
that middle section again.

114
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:36,146
Sure, why not?

115
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,517
Just so we're clear,
you understand

116
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,531
that me hanging back
to practice with you

117
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:49,116
is a pretext for letting you know
that I'm sexually available.

118
00:05:56,562 --> 00:05:57,562
Really?

119
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,194
Yeah, I'm good to go.

120
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:01,863
I thought you weren't interested in me.

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,802
That was before I saw you handling

122
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:06,387
that beautiful piece
of wood between your legs.

123
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,871
You mean my cello?

124
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12,684
No, I mean the obvious,
crude, double entendre.

125
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,151
I'm seducing you.

126
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:17,175
No kidding.

127
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:20,506
What can I say?
I'm a passionate and impulsive woman.

128
00:06:22,642 --> 00:06:23,642
So how about it?

129
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:27,632
Is it the waitress?

130
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:30,499
What about her?

131
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,066
I thought I saw your pupils
dilate when you looked at her.

132
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,461
Which, unless you're a heroin addict,
points to sexual attraction.

133
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,948
I did have a poppy seed bagel
for breakfast.

134
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:43,012
Which could cause a positive
urine test for opiates,

135
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,845
but certainly not dilate my pupils.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,546
So I guess there was no point
in bringing it up.

137
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:50,454
You and the waitress then.

138
00:06:50,698 --> 00:06:51,698
No... no.

139
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,374
There's nothing going on
between Penny and me.

140
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:57,002
So you're open
to a sexual relationship?

141
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,114
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

142
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,918
- Good.
- Yeah, it is. It is good.

143
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,871
Did you want to start now?

144
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:09,262
Why don't we finish
the section first?

145
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:12,601
A little musical foreplay.
Terrific.

146
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,114
I'm good to go.

147
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:36,377
Me, too.

148
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,740
Hey, Sheldon.
What's going on?

149
00:07:50,068 --> 00:07:52,307
I need your opinion
on a matter of semiotics.

150
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:53,899
I'm sorry?

151
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,436
Semiotics.
The study of signs and symbols.

152
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,262
It's a branch of philosophy
related to linguistics.

153
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,662
Okay, sweetie, I know you think
you're explaing yourself,

154
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,417
but you're really not.

155
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,200
Just come with me.

156
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:16,936
- Well?
- Well, what?

157
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,813
What does it mean?

158
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:21,651
Oh, come on,
you went to college.

159
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,121
Yes, but I was 11.

160
00:08:26,024 --> 00:08:28,103
All right, look,
a tie on the doorknob usually means

161
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:29,870
someone doesn't want to be disturbed

162
00:08:30,044 --> 00:08:33,118
because, they're...
you know, gettin' busy.

163
00:08:35,317 --> 00:08:37,208
So you're saying Leonard
has a girl in there?

164
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,738
Well, either that
or he's lost his tie rack

165
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:41,943
and gotten really into Bryan Adams.

166
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,193
Oh, Leonard, you magnificent beast.

167
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:50,493
We really shouldn't be standing here.

168
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,415
This is very awkward.

169
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:58,021
Oh, come on, Leonard's had
girls over before, right?

170
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,385
Yes, but there's usually planning,
courtship, advance notice...

171
00:09:03,673 --> 00:09:07,534
Last time, I was able to book a cruise
to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.

172
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:12,238
You had to leave the state
because your roommate was having sex?

173
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,464
I didn't have to.
The dates just happened to coincide.

174
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,478
So, do you know who's in there?

175
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,152
Well, there's Leonard.

176
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:30,323
And he's either with Leslie Winkle
or a 1930s gangster.

177
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,641
Good for him.

178
00:09:36,521 --> 00:09:38,140
Good for Leonard.

179
00:09:39,975 --> 00:09:41,047
Okay, g'night.

180
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:42,709
No, no, wait, hold on.

181
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
What's the matter?

182
00:09:44,602 --> 00:09:46,333
I don't know what the protocol is here.

183
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:49,870
Do I stay? Do I leave?

184
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,994
Do I wait to greet them
with a refreshing beverage?

185
00:09:55,824 --> 00:09:57,283
You're asking the wrong girl.

186
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,351
I'm usually
on the other side of the tie.

187
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,595
Hi, Leonard?

188
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:27,332
It's me, Sheldon...

189
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:30,988
In the living room.

190
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,847
I just... I wanted you
to know I saw the tie.

191
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,374
Message received.

192
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,524
You're welcome.

193
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:43,427
You carry on.

194
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,257
Give my best to Leslie.

195
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:23,336
Big Boy...

196
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,129
Someone touched my board.

197
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,335
Oh, God, my board!

198
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,266
Hey, what's the matter?

199
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:05,660
My equations, someone's tampered
with my equations.

200
00:12:06,013 --> 00:12:07,499
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am.

201
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:09,756
Look at the beta function
of quantum chromodynamics.

202
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,473
The sign's been changed.

203
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,375
Oh, yeah.

204
00:12:13,782 --> 00:12:15,960
But doesn't that fix the problem
you've been having?

205
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,473
Are you insane?
Are you out of your mind?

206
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:19,376
Are you-- Look!

207
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,841
That fixes the problem
I've been having.

208
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,399
You're welcome.

209
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:27,651
You did this?

210
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:31,654
I noticed it when I got up
to get a glass of water. So I fixed it.

211
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:34,763
Now you can show that quarks are
asymptotically free at high energies.

212
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:35,962
Pretty cool, huh?

213
00:12:38,285 --> 00:12:39,306
"Cool"?

214
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:43,443
Listen, I've got to get to the lab.
Thanks for a great night.

215
00:12:45,193 --> 00:12:46,659
Thank you.
I'll see you at work.

216
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,815
Hold on. Hold on!

217
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,876
- What?
- Who told you you could touch my board?

218
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:53,496
No one.

219
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:55,797
I don't come into your house
and touch your board.

220
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,488
There are no incorrect equations
on my board.

221
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:03,278
Oh, that is so...

222
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,811
so...

223
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,516
Sorry, I've got to run. If you come up
with an adjective, text me.

224
00:13:14,197 --> 00:13:15,201
Inconsiderate.

225
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,837
That is the adjective,
"inconsiderate. "

226
00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:22,726
You can stare at your board all day.
She's still going to be right.

227
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,742
I'm not staring, I'm hauling.

228
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,266
So...

229
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:30,029
how's it going?

230
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:34,654
Pretty good.

231
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,126
Just pretty good?
I'd think you were doing very good.

232
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,368
Pretty, very...
there's really no objective scale

233
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:46,571
for delineating variations of "good."
Why do you ask?

234
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:48,594
Well, a little bird told me

235
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,964
that you and Leslie
hooked up last night.

236
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,513
So, is it serious?
Do you like her?

237
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,112
I don't...

238
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,199
That's really two different questions.

239
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,649
I'm not...

240
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:07,426
Sheldon, we have to go!

241
00:14:07,988 --> 00:14:11,152
You're wound awfully tight for a man
who's just had sexual intercourse.

242
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:16,483
All right, I'll talk to you later,
but I am so happy for you.

243
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,794
Thank you.

244
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,411
What did she mean
she's happy for me?

245
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,771
Is she happy that
I'm seeing someone?

246
00:14:27,945 --> 00:14:29,902
Or is she happy because
she thinks that I am?

247
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,854
Because anyone who cared for someone
would want them to be happy.

248
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,635
Even if the reason for their happiness
made the first person unhappy.

249
00:14:37,392 --> 00:14:39,458
Because the second person,
though happy,

250
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,642
is now romantically unavailable
to the first person.

251
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:47,070
Do you realize I may have to share
a Nobel Prize with your booty call?

252
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,698
You know what?

253
00:14:52,564 --> 00:14:53,937
I'm being ridiculous.

254
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,603
Who cares what Penny thinks?

255
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,197
Leslie is a terrific girl.
She's attractive.

256
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,815
We like each other.
She's extremely intelligent...

257
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,745
- She's not that intelligent.
- She fixed your equation.

258
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:06,952
- She got lucky.
- You don't believe in luck.

259
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,693
I don't have to believe
in it for her to be lucky.

260
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:13,522
Regardless, I have a chance
at a real relationship with Leslie.

261
00:15:13,642 --> 00:15:15,007
I'm not going to pass that up

262
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,392
for some hypothetical future
of happiness with a woman

263
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,929
who may or may not
want me to be happy,

264
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:22,899
with a woman who is
currently making me happy.

265
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:27,106
I still don't care.

266
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:40,847
Careful, Leonard. Liquid nitrogen,
320 degrees below zero.

267
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,080
Why are you smashing
a flash-frozen banana?

268
00:15:52,292 --> 00:15:55,301
Because I got a bowl of Cheerios
and I couldn't find a knife.

269
00:15:57,453 --> 00:15:58,453
So anyway...

270
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,958
Hello.

271
00:16:03,846 --> 00:16:05,173
What are you doing?

272
00:16:05,904 --> 00:16:07,466
Just extending the intimacy.

273
00:16:07,974 --> 00:16:10,093
Do you want to slip over
to the radiation lab

274
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,570
and share a decontamination shower?

275
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:19,888
What exactly do you think's
going on between us?

276
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,782
I'm not sure, but I think I'm about
to discover how the banana felt.

277
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,504
Listen,
neither of us are neuroscientists,

278
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:33,657
but we both understand
the biochemistry of sex.

279
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:35,246
I mean, dopamine in our brains

280
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,339
is released across synapses,
causing pleasure.

281
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:40,054
You stick electrodes in a rat's brain,
give him an orgasm button,

282
00:16:40,174 --> 00:16:42,213
he'll push that thing
until he starves to death.

283
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:44,834
Well, who wouldn't?

284
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:47,350
Well, the only difference
between us and the rat

285
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,758
is that you can't stick an
electrode in our hypothalamus.

286
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,362
That's where you come in.

287
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,223
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
to be a part of it.

288
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:58,884
So what happens now?

289
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:02,653
I don't know about your sex drive,
but I'm probably good till New Year's.

290
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

291
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,945
You want to make plans for New Year's?

292
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:16,517
Please.
You're smothering me.

293
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:21,353
Look. It's Dr. Stud!

294
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,432
Dr. What?

295
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,255
The blogosphere is a-buzzin'
with news of you and Leslie Winkle

296
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:29,610
making <i>eine kleine
bang-bang musik</i>.

297
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,900
How did it get on the Internet?

298
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,272
I put it there.

299
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:36,933
How did you know about it?

300
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,646
A little bird told us.

301
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:42,491
Apparently,
you are a magnificent beast.

302
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,905
That part's true.

303
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,080
I think I may have
misjudged this restaurant.

304
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,305
- No kidding.
- I don't want to go out on a limb,

305
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:59,407
but I think we may be looking
at my new Tuesday hamburger.

306
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,744
Your old Tuesday hamburger
will be so brokenhearted.

307
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:08,096
Way ahead of you. I was thinking
of moving Big Boy to Thursdays,

308
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,099
and just dropping Souplantation.

309
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:12,547
Really?

310
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,064
The name always confused me anyway.
Souplantation.

311
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,863
You can't grow soup.

312
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:23,082
So, how's everything?

313
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,221
Terrific. You'll be happy to know
that I plan to come here

314
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:28,346
every Tuesday night
for the foreseeable future.

315
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,495
Really?

316
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,897
Who do I speak to about
permanently reserving this table?

317
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:38,026
I don't know...
A psychiatrist?

318
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,190
So, hey,

319
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:44,017
how are things with you and Leslie?

320
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,616
To be honest, I don't think
it's going to work out.

321
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:50,515
Oh, that's too bad.

322
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,157
Hey, don't worry.

323
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,534
I'm sure there's someone out there
who's just right for you.

324
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,237
What did she mean by that?!

325
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,387
Was that just a generic platitude,

326
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:05,489
or was that a subtle bid
for attention?

327
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,571
You know why this hamburger
surpasses the Big Boy?

328
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,433
This is a single-decker hamburger,
whereas the Big Boy is a double-decker.

329
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:17,867
This has a much more satisfying
meat-to-bun-to-condiment ratio.

330
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,979
Are you even listening to me?

331
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:24,806
Of course, I'm listening.
Blah, blah, hopeless Penny delusion...

332
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:28,661
Okay, then.

333
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,865
You know, you can grow
the ingredients for soup.
