1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,846
You know, I've been thinking
about time travel again.

2
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:07,819
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:10,557
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,725
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

5
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:16,991
...I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

6
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:20,728
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,903
- Interesting.
- Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

8
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:26,904
Sounds like a breakthrough.

9
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,568
<i>Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?</i>

10
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:32,078
It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

11
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,982
I guess congratulations are in order.

12
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:40,111
No, congratulations
will have been in order.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,281
You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,427
I know, I'm familiar with you.

15
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:47,421
The last party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me...

16
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:49,929
...and talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,124
Yes, I was there.

18
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,132
You know what's interesting
about caves?

19
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,635
- What?
- Nothing.

20
00:00:56,506 --> 00:01:00,875
We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

21
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:04,013
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,047
How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

23
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,311
...despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years...

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,421
...and instead have written books...

25
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:15,490
...that reduce the great concepts
of science to anecdotes...

26
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:16,852
...each one dumbed down...

27
00:01:17,026 --> 00:01:20,792
...to accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement. "

28
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,999
- "Mahalo" is a nice touch.
- Hmm.

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,566
Only eight consonants
in the Hawaiian language.

30
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:34,073
Interesting, you should lead with that.

31
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,941
Oh, God, look at this buffet.

32
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:40,912
I love America.

33
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:45,316
- You don't have buffets in India?
- Of course, but it's all Indian food.

34
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:48,488
You can't find a bagel in Mumbai
to save your life.

35
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,421
Smear me.

36
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:54,921
- Well, here's an interesting turn of events.
- What?

37
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,964
Howard brought a date?

38
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:04,004
A more plausible explanation is that his work
in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.

39
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,869
Hey, what up, science bitches?

40
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,975
May I introduce my special lady friend,
Summer.

41
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:13,877
Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

42
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,677
Right. Sorry.

43
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,179
Here comes our new boss. Be polite.

44
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:20,583
Hi, fellas.

45
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,622
- Eric Gablehauser.
- Howard Wolowitz.

46
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:25,522
Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

47
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,861
An actual real scientist.

48
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,695
How was that?

49
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:37,668
I can't believe he fired me.

50
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,207
You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

51
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:44,938
...whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

52
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,784
In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect. "

53
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,138
Morning.

54
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:18,678
Morning.

55
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:20,873
You're making eggs for breakfast?

56
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,042
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

57
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:27,584
Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

58
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:31,625
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

59
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:35,389
...from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-à-vis taste.

60
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,826
Sounds yummy.

61
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,066
I look forward to your work with bacon.

62
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,068
As do I.

63
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:47,975
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

64
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,909
I don't want my job back.

65
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,981
I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

66
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,584
Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

67
00:03:56,753 --> 00:04:00,917
Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

68
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,518
This is my first day off in decades
and I'm going to savor it.

69
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:09,563
Okay. I'll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

70
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,929
I'm not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

71
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:15,960
And we all thank you.

72
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,664
Use new eggs.

73
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:55,206
Hi, I'm running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

74
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:58,102
Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances...

75
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,808
...people unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

76
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:03,748
- I'm sorry?
- I need eggs.

77
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,945
- Four dozen should suffice.
- Four dozen?

78
00:05:06,122 --> 00:05:11,526
Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

79
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:14,492
- Okay, one more time?
- Never mind, you won't get it right.

80
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,862
I'd better come with you.

81
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,431
Oh, yay.

82
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,200
How come
you didn't go in to work today?

83
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:30,710
I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

84
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,905
So you got canned, huh?

85
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:36,176
Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

86
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,084
But, yeah.

87
00:05:39,188 --> 00:05:40,280
Maybe it's for the best.

88
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:43,516
You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens. "

89
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,721
No, it doesn't.

90
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,355
Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

91
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:50,965
- Or there are motion sensors involved.
- No, I meant...

92
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:55,537
Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

93
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,738
Never mind.

94
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:02,068
Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

95
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:03,269
We're fine.

96
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,505
You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

97
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:06,705
Oh, sure I am.

98
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,544
No, no, let me do the math for you.

99
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,152
This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

100
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,220
Now, add 140 for me, 120 for you...

101
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,415
- One-twenty?
- Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

102
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:19,425
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

103
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:21,758
Well, yeah.

104
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:22,955
Interesting.

105
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,533
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

106
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,795
Let's say 4390.

107
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,370
Fine.

108
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,941
We're traveling forward at...
Good Lord....51 miles an hour.

109
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:37,471
Let's assume that your brakes are new
and the calipers are aligned.

110
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,308
By the time we come to a stop...

111
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,076
...we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

112
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:46,017
An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and...

113
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:49,920
Oh, look,
they built a new putt-putt course.

114
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,719
This is great.

115
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,729
Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people...

116
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:00,630
...just living their ordinary,
colorless, work-a-day lives.

117
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,995
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

118
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:07,500
And thank you, ordinary person.

119
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,142
Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

120
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:12,474
No. No, not really.

121
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:15,549
Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

122
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:19,051
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth...

123
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:22,157
...knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

124
00:07:22,558 --> 00:07:25,118
Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

125
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:28,386
No, this is fun.

126
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:31,362
The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

127
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,799
...is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

128
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,233
- Hmm. Interesting.
- Isn't it?

129
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:39,067
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

130
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:44,503
Oh, boy.

131
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,043
What now?

132
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,777
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin...

133
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,148
...but the human body
can only absorb so much.

134
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:58,191
What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

135
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,830
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

136
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,829
Well, then you'll want some manganese.

137
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,997
Well, that was fun.

138
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:14,643
Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

139
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,868
I don't know, Sheldon.

140
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:20,379
It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

141
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,217
Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

142
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,821
For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

143
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:28,456
...one month's supply at a time.

144
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,984
- What?
- Well, think about it.

145
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:34,561
It doesn't spoil...

146
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,291
...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

147
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,862
You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

148
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:43,130
Well, 30, 35...

149
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:46,070
- When did your mother go into menopause?
- Okay.

150
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,571
I'm not talking about this with you.

151
00:08:48,744 --> 00:08:49,836
Oh, Penny.

152
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:53,914
This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

153
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:57,814
Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle...

154
00:08:57,987 --> 00:08:59,750
Are you fairly regular?

155
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,393
Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

156
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,068
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

157
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,731
I think it's her time of the month.

158
00:09:21,911 --> 00:09:24,573
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

159
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,945
What's with the fish?

160
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,610
It's an experiment.

161
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:36,422
- What happened to your egg research?
- Oh, that was a dead end.

162
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:39,686
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

163
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,990
So fish.

164
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:47,634
I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

165
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:53,298
...into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights. "

166
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:57,039
Fish nightlights.

167
00:09:57,213 --> 00:10:00,273
It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

168
00:10:01,117 --> 00:10:02,141
Mum's the word.

169
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:08,084
Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to Gablehauser and get your job back?

170
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:10,885
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

171
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,153
Like luminous fish.

172
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,196
- Shhh!
- I'm sorry, I didn't...

173
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,794
That's just the beginning.

174
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:23,228
I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

175
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,806
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

176
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,872
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

177
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:38,109
- Thanks for coming on such short notice.
- You did the right thing calling.

178
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,482
I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

179
00:10:40,656 --> 00:10:43,489
Every day, he's got a new obsession.

180
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,259
This is a particularly disturbing one.

181
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,368
Mommy?

182
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,941
Hi, baby.

183
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,610
<i>You called my mother?</i>

184
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:13,154
Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

185
00:11:13,655 --> 00:11:17,147
- Thank you.
- Honey, why did you get a loom?

186
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,726
I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...

187
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:25,324
...loom. "

188
00:11:26,801 --> 00:11:28,996
Mom, what are you doing here?

189
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,570
Leonard called me.

190
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:32,866
I know, but why?

191
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,475
Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

192
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:38,875
...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

193
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,845
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

194
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:45,145
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

195
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,450
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

196
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,289
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

197
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,561
I went to the market with Penny.

198
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,458
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

199
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:57,655
Well, then, buckle up.

200
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:01,928
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

201
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:06,299
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

202
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:07,771
Yes, well, I'm not a child.

203
00:12:07,943 --> 00:12:11,037
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

204
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,376
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

205
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,079
Wait, where are you going?

206
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:20,278
To my room and no one's allowed in.

207
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:24,391
- He gets his temper from his daddy.
- Ah.

208
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,925
- He's got my eyes.
- I see.

209
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:30,626
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

210
00:12:33,969 --> 00:12:35,459
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

211
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:36,661
I'm not hungry.

212
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:39,773
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

213
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,000
He may stay in there till the rapture.

214
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:45,842
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

215
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,481
I love the boy to death...

216
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,745
...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

217
00:12:53,722 --> 00:12:55,121
Excuse me for being so bold...

218
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,124
...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

219
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:03,321
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

220
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,932
I made chicken.

221
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:11,097
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

222
00:13:16,478 --> 00:13:19,106
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

223
00:13:19,281 --> 00:13:21,511
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

224
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:26,052
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

225
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,155
You know, those that needed it.

226
00:13:28,823 --> 00:13:30,586
That is a lovely story.

227
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,522
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

228
00:13:32,694 --> 00:13:35,219
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

229
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,558
His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

230
00:13:37,732 --> 00:13:40,963
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon. "

231
00:13:41,803 --> 00:13:44,601
- Sounds like a wise man.
- Oh, not so wise.

232
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:47,867
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

233
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:54,306
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

234
00:13:54,482 --> 00:13:56,814
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

235
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,009
Oh, all the time.

236
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,381
I remember one summer
when he was 13...

237
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:03,683
...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

238
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:06,986
...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

239
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:11,565
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

240
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,231
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

241
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:19,863
...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...

242
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,841
...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

243
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,375
- Well, what happened?
- Well, poor boy had a fit.

244
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:30,712
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

245
00:14:31,686 --> 00:14:33,984
- A death ray?
- Well, that's what he called it.

246
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:36,350
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

247
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:39,860
It pissed our dog off to no end.

248
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,194
You know, you two make a cute couple.

249
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,465
L... No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

250
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:53,699
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...

251
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:57,070
Or friends.

252
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:59,341
- Did I pluck a nerve there?
- Oh, yeah.

253
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:02,142
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

254
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:08,386
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

255
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:13,050
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

256
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:17,460
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...

257
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,396
...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

258
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:25,463
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

259
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,084
Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

260
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:40,915
It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

261
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:42,613
- Love?
- Lard.

262
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,263
- Hey, look who's com...
- Shh. You'll spook him.

263
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:55,936
He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

264
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:05,641
This is ridiculous.

265
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,441
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

266
00:16:07,982 --> 00:16:11,782
You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

267
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,850
You don't hunt, do you?

268
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:30,565
Good morning, Snickerdoodle.

269
00:16:30,738 --> 00:16:31,932
- Morning.
- Oh.

270
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:34,666
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

271
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:41,377
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

272
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:46,216
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

273
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:49,315
What do you want, Mom?

274
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,683
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...

275
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:56,729
...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

276
00:16:56,898 --> 00:17:00,026
- Yeah?
- Well, I'm done fishing.

277
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,634
- You put those on.
- What for?

278
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,705
Because you're gonna go
to your office...

279
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,399
...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

280
00:17:08,576 --> 00:17:10,009
- No.
- I'm sorry.

281
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:14,274
Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

282
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:18,713
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

283
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,252
Now, you listen here.

284
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:22,912
I have been telling you since you were 4.

285
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:27,050
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

286
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:30,026
- Why not?
- Because people don't like it.

287
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,124
Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

288
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,900
Now, let's get cracking.

289
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:43,032
Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

290
00:17:44,512 --> 00:17:49,176
Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

291
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,183
Problem solved.

292
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:57,916
Really? That's impressive.

293
00:17:58,092 --> 00:18:00,890
Leonard, the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

294
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:03,462
Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

295
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,064
...who are dumb as soup.

296
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,936
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

297
00:18:13,107 --> 00:18:17,100
- Well, actually...
- Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

298
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:22,246
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

299
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:26,076
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

300
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:30,219
Um...

301
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:34,555
As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

302
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:36,959
...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

303
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:38,655
...when I called you an idiot.

304
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:42,501
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong...

305
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,468
...to point it out.

306
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,004
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

307
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,604
- Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
- Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

308
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,045
Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

309
00:18:56,217 --> 00:18:58,549
Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

310
00:19:01,422 --> 00:19:03,322
- Recently?
- Long enough.

311
00:19:04,192 --> 00:19:06,057
Please.

312
00:19:06,694 --> 00:19:08,457
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

313
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,002
Okay.

314
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,668
Hey, how did it go?

315
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,638
I got my job back.

316
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,937
Really? What happened?

317
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,638
I'm not quite sure.

318
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:32,377
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

319
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,181
Well, that narrows it down.

320
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,828
I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

321
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,259
Thanks, Mom.

322
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,268
- Mom?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:55,101
Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

324
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:01,147
We'll see. Sleep tight.
