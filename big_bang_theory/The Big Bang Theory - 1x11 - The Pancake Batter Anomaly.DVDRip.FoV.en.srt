1
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:30,112
- Checkmate.
- Aaarggh!

2
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,671
Again?

3
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:34,840
Obviously, you're not well suited
for three-dimensional chess.

4
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,351
Perhaps three-dimensional Candy Land
would be more your speed.

5
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,185
Just reset the board.

6
00:00:40,356 --> 00:00:44,417
It must be humbling to suck
on so many different levels.

7
00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,457
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

8
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,898
- Did you get my mail?
- Yeah, right here.

9
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,528
- How was Nebraska?
- Well, better than North Dakota.

10
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,240
I guess that joke's only funny
in Nebraska.

11
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,884
From the data at hand,
you can't draw that conclusion.

12
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:12,681
All you can say with absolute certainty
is that that joke is not funny here.

13
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,486
Boy, it's good to be back.

14
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,825
- How's your family?
- Oh, it was the worst trip.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,968
- Everyone got sick over the weekend.
- Sick?

16
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:27,763
Here we go.

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,041
- What kind of sick?
- Oh, the flu, I guess.

18
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,302
I don't need you to guess,
I need you to know.

19
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,912
Now, when did the symptoms
first appear?

20
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,343
Maybe Friday.

21
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,609
Friday. Was that morning or afternoon?

22
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,181
- I don't...
- Think, woman.

23
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,288
Who blew their nose and when?

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,120
Sheldon, relax.
She doesn't have any symptoms.

25
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:50,850
I'm sure she's not contagious.

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,961
Oh, please.

27
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,491
If influenza was only contagious
after symptoms appear...

28
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,531
...it would've died out years ago.

29
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,965
Somewhere between tool using
and cave painting...

30
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:04,732
<i>...Homo habilis would've figured out
to kill the guy with the runny nose.</i>

31
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,333
Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon.
He's a bit of a germaphobe.

32
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,705
That's okay. I understand.

33
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,871
Thanks for your consideration.
Now please leave.

34
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:17,243
You'd better go
before he starts spraying you with Lysol.

35
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,354
Okay, well,
thank you for getting my mail.

36
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,854
No, problem. Welcome home.

37
00:02:28,498 --> 00:02:30,125
What?

38
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,627
What the hell are you doing?

39
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,668
I'm making petri dishes
to grow throat cultures.

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,397
With lime Jell-O?

41
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:13,975
I need a growth medium, and someone
polished off the apricot yogurt.

42
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,610
Here. Swab my throat.

43
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,345
- I don't think so.
- Leonard.

44
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:25,681
If I'm going to get ahead of this, I need
to find out what's growing in my throat.

45
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,623
Sheldon, you are not sick.

46
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:33,091
This is, but you are not.

47
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:34,996
We have no idea what pathogen...

48
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:37,758
...Typhoid Penny
has introduced into our environment.

49
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:42,894
And having never been to Nebraska, I'm
certain I have no corn-husking antibodies.

50
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,276
Sheldon, don't you think
you're overreacting?

51
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:52,175
When I'm lying comatose in a hospital
relying on inferior minds to cure me...

52
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:54,509
...these cultures
and my accompanying notes...

53
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,914
...will give them a fighting chance.

54
00:04:01,024 --> 00:04:02,821
I'm going back to bed.

55
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,961
- Wait, put this in the bathroom.
- What for?

56
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,256
I need to measure
my fluid intake and output...

57
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:10,695
...to make sure
my kidneys aren't shutting down.

58
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:15,700
I mix pancake batter in this.

59
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:19,402
No, that measuring cup
has always been for urine.

60
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:23,339
You had time to make a label
for everything in this apartment...

61
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,980
...including the label-maker...

62
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:28,743
...but you didn't have 10 seconds
to make one that said, "Urine cup"?

63
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:32,516
It's right here on the bottom.

64
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,590
Huh.

65
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,158
I guess I owe the Betty Crocker Company
a letter of apology.

66
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,676
Oh, dear God.

67
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,648
Leonard.

68
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,155
Leonard, I'm sick.

69
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:12,287
Leonard.

70
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,497
Leonard, I'm sick.

71
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,866
Leonard.

72
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,099
Leonard.

73
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:26,671
Leonard.

74
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:33,877
Leonard, my comforter fell down
and my sinuses hurt when I bend over.

75
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,914
Leonard?

76
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,795
Ow.

77
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,169
<i>Hey.
- Leonard, where are you?</i>

78
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,306
I'm at work.

79
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,668
At 6:30 in the morning?

80
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,670
Yes.

81
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:03,303
On Sunday?

82
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,640
Yes.

83
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,174
- Why?
- They asked me to come in.

84
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:12,715
- Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.
- They texted me.

85
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:16,959
Well, as I predicted, I am sick.

86
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,653
My fever has been tracking up
exponentially since 2 a. M...

87
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,822
...and I am producing sputum
at an alarming rate.

88
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,270
<i>- No kidding.
- Nope. Not only that...</i>

89
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,239
...it has shifted from clear
to milky green.

90
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:36,674
All right, well, get some rest
and drink plenty of fluids.

91
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:41,681
What else would I drink?
Gases? Solids? Lonized plasma?

92
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:43,582
Drink whatever you want.

93
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:46,051
- I want soup.
- Then make soup.

94
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:48,918
- We don't have soup.
- I'm at work, Sheldon.

95
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:56,193
- Is that a dog?
- Yes.

96
00:06:56,365 --> 00:06:58,856
- In the lab?
- Yes.

97
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:03,004
They're training dogs
to operate the centrifuge...

98
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:08,576
...for when they need dogs to operate
the centrifuge for blind scientists.

99
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,109
I have to go.

100
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:17,245
Howard, it's the phone.

101
00:07:18,387 --> 00:07:21,948
I know it's the phone, Ma.
I hear the phone.

102
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:27,529
- Well, who's calling at this ungodly hour?
- I don't know.

103
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,793
Well, ask them why they're calling
at this ungodly hour.

104
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:35,426
How can I ask them
when I'm talking to you?

105
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,699
Hello?

106
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,308
Howard, it's Leonard. Code milky green.

107
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,745
- Dear Lord, not milky green.
- Affirmative. With fever.

108
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,045
- Who's on the phone?
- It's Leonard.

109
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,678
- Why is he calling?
- Sheldon's sick.

110
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,724
Were you playing with him?

111
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,758
For God's sake, Ma, I'm 26 years old.

112
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,957
Excuse me, Mr. Grownup.

113
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:11,199
- What do you want for breakfast?
- Chocolate milk and Eggos, please.

114
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:13,802
- Howard, listen to me.
- Hang on. Call waiting.

115
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:17,275
<i>- No, don't... Don't...
- Hello?</i>

116
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:18,811
Howard, I'm sick.

117
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,948
Howard's sleeping. This is his mother.

118
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:34,028
Why are you calling at this ungodly hour?

119
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:36,124
I need soup.

120
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:38,831
Then call your own mother.

121
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,965
It was Sheldon.

122
00:08:42,138 --> 00:08:44,231
<i>- I tried to stop you.
- It's my own fault.</i>

123
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:48,867
I forgot the protocol we put in place
after the great ear infection of '06.

124
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,236
You call Koothrappali.

125
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:54,008
We need to find a place to lay low
for the next 18 to 24 hours.

126
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:57,209
Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?

127
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:01,550
I just had the carpet steamed.

128
00:09:02,024 --> 00:09:04,151
That's a negatory.

129
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:07,421
<i>But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon
at the Nuart today.</i>

130
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,589
Five movies, two hours apiece.

131
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,158
It's a start.

132
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,839
Homeless crazy guy at Table 18.

133
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,738
No, just crazy.

134
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,949
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

135
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:33,684
I'm sick. Thank you very much.

136
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,221
How could you've gotten it from me?

137
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:37,325
- I'm not sick.
- You're a carrier.

138
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,461
All these people here are doomed.

139
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,063
- You're doomed.
- Shh!

140
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,767
Sheldon, what do you want?

141
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,766
I want soup.

142
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,098
Why didn't you just...?

143
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,741
Why didn't you just have soup at home?

144
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,613
Penny, I have an IQ of 187.

145
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:03,183
Don't you imagine
that if there were a way for me...

146
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:06,321
...to have had soup at home,
I would have thought of it?

147
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,221
You can have soup delivered.

148
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,993
I did not think of that.

149
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,463
Clearly, febrile delirium is setting in.

150
00:10:18,634 --> 00:10:23,128
Please bring me some soup
while I still understand what a spoon is for.

151
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:25,069
Okay. What kind of soup do you want?

152
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:27,766
Well, my mother used to make me
this split-pea...

153
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:32,073
...with little frankfurter slices
and these homemade croutons.

154
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,739
We have chicken, tortilla and potato leek.

155
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:39,746
Can I get any of those with little
frankfurter slices and homemade croutons?

156
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:41,722
No.

157
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:43,788
Then surprise me.

158
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,972
Would you call that moss green
or forest green?

159
00:11:10,653 --> 00:11:13,747
Look at this. Everyone went chimp.

160
00:11:14,457 --> 00:11:16,721
I'd like to point out, I voted for orangutan...

161
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:18,450
...but you shouted me down.

162
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:25,263
Oh, hi, Penny.
- Hey, where are you?

163
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,733
I'm at work.

164
00:11:29,238 --> 00:11:30,330
You sound funny.

165
00:11:30,506 --> 00:11:34,374
Oh, I'm in a radiation suit.

166
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,408
- What's up?
- Yeah, well, I'm at work too.

167
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,776
And you'll never guess who's here
infecting my entire station.

168
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,644
Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory.

169
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,851
<i>- Just tell him to go home.
- Well, he won't leave.</i>

170
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:49,320
He says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus
and someone will harvest his organs.

171
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:53,325
He's paranoid
and he's established a nest.

172
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,387
Can you please come get him?

173
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:59,090
Uh, yeah, I'd be happy to, Penny.

174
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,628
Oh, my God,
there's a breach in the radiation unit.

175
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,205
The whole city is in jeopardy.

176
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,935
Oh, my God. Professor Guggenheim
is melting. Gotta go. Bye.

177
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,550
- I feel really guilty.
You did what you had to do.

178
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:21,690
Take your stinking paws off my popcorn...

179
00:12:21,857 --> 00:12:24,792
...you damn dirty ape.

180
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:30,996
Thanks for bringing me home.

181
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,431
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.

182
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:36,469
It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

183
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,664
Good, good.

184
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,933
Okay, well, you feel better.

185
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,443
Wait. Where are you going?

186
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:49,108
Um, home to write some bad checks.

187
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:51,347
You're going to leave me?

188
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:55,049
Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?

189
00:12:55,224 --> 00:12:58,455
Of course, but not by myself.

190
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:00,390
Really? Never?

191
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,691
Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...

192
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,993
...at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.

193
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,804
- Studying abroad?
- No, visiting professor.

194
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:16,005
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...

195
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,305
...and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...

196
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:22,212
...with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.

197
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,979
And there was no one there
to take care of you?

198
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:28,590
No, my mom had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...

199
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:32,488
...because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.

200
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,754
- Again?
- It was tornado season.

201
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:38,195
And it was an aluminum house.

202
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:43,331
Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.

203
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:45,906
When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...

204
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,442
<i>...she said,
"Möchtest du eine Darmspülung?"</i>

205
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,278
What does that mean?

206
00:13:51,447 --> 00:13:55,008
Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema?"

207
00:13:57,386 --> 00:14:01,379
Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.
What do you need?

208
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:06,051
Well, my mom used to give me
sponge baths.

209
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,458
Okay, ground rules:

210
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:17,197
No sponge baths
and definitely no enemas.

211
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,369
Agreed.

212
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:27,273
Here we go.
Ten and a half hours of apey goodness.

213
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,087
Damn it, my glasses.

214
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:36,124
Okay, I'm blind here, guys.
Can you help me find them?

215
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,123
- Sorry.
- Okay.

216
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:42,457
Found them.

217
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:47,168
- Oh, great.
- I'm sorry. Don't you have a spare?

218
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,964
- Yeah, at home.
- Lf you leave now, you can be back...

219
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,302
...before the gorillas whip
the crap out of Charlton Heston.

220
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,533
Unless Sheldon's there.

221
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,409
You'll be trapped forever
in his whiny, hyper-neurotic snot web.

222
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:08,785
Hi, Penny?

223
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,359
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?

224
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,456
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.

225
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:19,931
Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

226
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:22,635
He's home. I'm screwed.

227
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:28,968
Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.

228
00:15:29,878 --> 00:15:31,675
How about Lasik?

229
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,807
- You want me to get eye surgery?
- Would you rather go back...

230
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:40,115
...and deal with Sheldon or have a stranger
carve out your corneas with a laser beam?

231
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:44,618
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

232
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:49,188
Okay, nice and cozy.

233
00:15:49,632 --> 00:15:52,658
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

234
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,699
Will you please rub this on my chest?

235
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, Sheldon. Can't you do that yourself?

236
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:03,208
VapoRub makes my hands smell funny.

237
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:07,212
- But, Sheldon...
- Please, please, please.

238
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,149
I can't believe I'm doing this.

239
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,656
No, no. Counterclockwise,
or my chest hair mats.

240
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,499
Sorry.

241
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,169
Can you sing "Soft Kitty"?

242
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:36,835
What?

243
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:39,503
My mom used to sing it to me
when I was sick.

244
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:42,708
- I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.
- I'll teach you.

245
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,731
Now you.

246
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:20,216
Keep rubbing.

247
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,109
What do you see? What do you see?
I can't...

248
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,507
- Living room appears to be empty.
- Okay, he must be in his bedroom.

249
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:50,118
My spare glasses are in my bedroom,
on my dresser, next to my bat signal.

250
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,417
I'm not going in there.

251
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,615
- Raj?
- No way, Jose.

252
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,654
- But I can't do it. I can't see anything.
- It's all right.

253
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:01,455
Wireless mini-cam
and Bluetooth headset.

254
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,098
We'll be your eyes.

255
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:07,094
- Fine.
- One more thing.

256
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:11,803
This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.

257
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,169
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...

258
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,971
...this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.

259
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,946
At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...

260
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:24,643
...you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.

261
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,515
Won't my footsteps set it off?

262
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,054
No. You'll be on your hands and knees.

263
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,988
Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.

264
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,789
How do I carry it
if I'm on my hands and knees?

265
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,636
Stay low.

266
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,569
Bear left.

267
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:45,798
- Now keep true.
- What?

268
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:49,137
- It means go straight.
- Then just say, "Go straight. "

269
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:53,479
You don't say, "Go straight" when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true. "

270
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,844
All right.

271
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,015
I just hit my head.

272
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,551
Because you didn't keep true.

273
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,558
<i>Okay, turn right.</i>

274
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,189
The picture's breaking up.

275
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:13,027
Angle your head to the right.

276
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:16,169
<i>Now, a little more.</i>

277
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:17,828
Little more.

278
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,865
That's it. Now just keep true.

279
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:27,512
All right, you're close enough
to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.

280
00:19:28,817 --> 00:19:30,512
<i>Now, turn it on.</i>

281
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:33,211
<i>- It wasn't on?
- No.</i>

282
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,356
Then why did I have to crawl?

283
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,726
Oh, I guess you didn't.

284
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,056
<i>Okay, it's on.</i>

285
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,963
Good. From this point forward,
you will have to crawl.

286
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,262
I know.

287
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,103
Hang on,
the sensor's picking up something.

288
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,972
Turn your head back.

289
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,082
You rat bastard.

290
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,782
Told you the sensor would work.

291
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,118
Hi.

292
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,318
You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.

293
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:15,861
Come on, I had to.
You see what he's like.

294
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,659
Penny? Penny, I'm hungry.

295
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,028
It's okay, sweetie. Good news.

296
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:22,932
- Leonard's home.
- No.

297
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,665
- Here you go, good luck, bye.
- Oh, wait, wait.

298
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:30,608
Leonard? I'm hungry.
- Wait. Penny, take me with you.

299
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,713
Leonard?

300
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:42,088
I want grilled cheese.

301
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:04,576
Do you think Penny will come here
and take care of us?

302
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,915
I don't think Penny's
ever coming here again.

303
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:14,454
I'm very congested.

304
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,283
Yeah? So?

305
00:21:17,459 --> 00:21:22,226
Can you go to the kitchen and get me
the turkey baster labeled, "Mucus"?

306
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,361
If I stand, I'll vomit.

307
00:21:28,904 --> 00:21:31,896
Under the sink. Yellow Tupperware bowl.
