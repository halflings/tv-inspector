1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:03,735
- Take him down!
- He's got you, Sheldon.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:06,234
- Look at this move!
- He's completely schooling you.

3
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:09,523
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,972
It's called Tresling.

5
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:13,286
It combines the physical strength
of arm wrestling

6
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:16,603
with the mental agility of Tetris
into the ultimate sport.

7
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,883
That's terrific,
but they wanted me to ask you

8
00:00:19,003 --> 00:00:20,565
to cut it the hell out.

9
00:00:20,726 --> 00:00:22,502
Great. Come here, guys. Come on.

10
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,696
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

11
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,964
We might as well stop. It's a stalemate.
You're beating me in Tetris,

12
00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:32,911
but you've got the upper body
strength of a Keebler elf.

13
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,372
Keebler elf?
I've got your Keebler elf right here.

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:42,027
Okay, it's a stalemate.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,216
So, Leonard, will we be
seeing you on Saturday

16
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:48,986
- for your free birthday cheesecake?
- He can't eat cheesecake.

17
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:51,721
- He's lactose intolerant.
- He can have carrot cake.

18
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:54,766
- What about the cream cheese frosting?
- He can scrape it off.

19
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:58,937
Forget about the cake.
How do you know my birthday's Saturday?

20
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,686
I did your horoscope, remember?
I was gonna do everybody's,

21
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:04,234
until Sheldon went on
one of his typical psychotic rants.

22
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:08,606
For the record, "that psychotic rant"
was a concise summation

23
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:12,534
of the research of Bertram Forer,
who, in 1948, proved conclusively

24
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:14,553
through meticulously
designed experiments

25
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:17,038
that astrology is nothing
but pseudo-scientific hokum.

26
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:18,998
Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.

27
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,042
Are we gonna see you Saturday?

28
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:23,836
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

29
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:26,548
- I don't celebrate my birthday.
- Shut up. Yeah, you do.

30
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,842
It's no big deal;
it's just the way I was raised.

31
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,469
My parents focused
on celebrating achievements,

32
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,764
and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

33
00:01:36,037 --> 00:01:37,275
That's so silly.

34
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,553
It's actually based
on very sound theories.

35
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:42,435
- His mother published a paper on it.
- What was it called?

36
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,733
"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?

37
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:47,444
It was obviously effective.

38
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,748
Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

39
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,792
Perhaps if she'd also denied him
Christmas,

40
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,430
he'd be a little better at it.

41
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:56,369
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,824
Well, I love birthdays.

43
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:00,662
Waking up to Mom's special
French toast breakfast,

44
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:02,392
wearing the birthday king crown,

45
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:04,335
playing laser tag with all my friends...

46
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:06,546
Yeah, see?
That's what kids should have.

47
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,483
Actually, that was last year.

48
00:02:12,204 --> 00:02:15,388
So you really never had
a birthday party?

49
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:18,642
No, but it was okay.
When I was little, I'd think

50
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:21,700
maybe my parents would change their mind
and surprise me with a party.

51
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,147
Like this one birthday
I came home from my cello lesson

52
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:26,511
and I saw a lot of strange
cars parked out front.

53
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:28,937
When I got to the door,
I could hear people whispering

54
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,988
and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

55
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:33,865
And?

56
00:02:34,026 --> 00:02:36,056
It turns out my grandfather had died.

57
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,662
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

58
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:42,040
Well, it was kind
of like a birthday party.

59
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:46,072
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

60
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:49,213
It's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

61
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:50,215
You think?

62
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:52,467
Go ahead, tell her about
your senior prom.

63
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,100
Episode 16:
The Peanut Reaction

1
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,500
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

2
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,200
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

3
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,400
When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy!"

4
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,100
- Hello, Penny. Leonard just left.
- I know. I want to talk to you.

5
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,900
What would we talk about?

6
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,700
We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

7
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,700
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.

8
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,800
- Can you just let me in?
- All right,

9
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

10
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,600
Here's the deal. We're gonna throw
Leonard a kick-ass surprise party

11
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,200
- for his birthday on Saturday.
- I hardly think so.

12
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,400
Leonard made it very clear
he doesn't want a party.

13
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Did someone say... "party"?

14
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,500
He just doesn't know he wants
one 'cause he's never had one.

15
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,700
I suppose that's possible,
but for the record,

16
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,400
I've never had a threesome
and yet I still know I want one.

17
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Howard, here's the difference...
The possibility exists

18
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,800
that Leonard could have a birthday party
before hell freezes over.

19
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,700
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

20
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

21
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
Can you bring a friend?

22
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,600
I think a birthday party's
a terrible idea.

23
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,600
I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

24
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,600
Anguish?!

25
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Year after year, I had to endure

26
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,100
wearing comical hats while being forced

27
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,600
into the crowded, sweaty
hell of bouncy castles.

28
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,500
Not to mention being blindfolded

29
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
and spun toward a grotesque
tailless donkey

30
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,200
as the other children mocked
my disorientation.

31
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,100
Okay, sweetie, I understand

32
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,900
you have scars
that no nonprofessional can heal,

33
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,900
but, nevertheless, we're going
to throw Leonard a birthday party.

34
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
Have I pointed out that I'm extremely
uncomfortable with dancing,

35
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,500
loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity?

36
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
- Nevertheless...
- In addition, I...

37
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,200
Here's the deal:

38
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,600
You either help me throw a birthday
party or I will go into your bedroom

39
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,200
and unbag all of your most valuable
mint-condition comic books.

40
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
And on one of them,
you won't know which,

41
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,200
I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

42
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,700
You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic, it's no longer mint.

43
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

44
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,500
Well, of course, I...

45
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,600
I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kick-ass birthday party.

46
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,000
That's not the secret knock.

47
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,400
This is the secret knock.

48
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
What difference does it make?

49
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,900
The whole point of a secret knock
is to establish a non-verbal signal

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
to verify the identity
of one's co-conspirators.

51
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,100
- Is that Raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.

52
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,200
Will you just let us in.

53
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,000
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,700
- So what'd you get the birthday boy?
- Well, Raj got him an awesome,

55
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,300
limited edition Dark Knight sculpture
based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman.

56
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
And I got him this amazing
autographed copy

57
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,200
of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.

58
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,600
Nice.

59
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,500
I got him a sweater.

60
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,600
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

61
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,300
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.

62
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,800
- Why not?
- Don't ask.

63
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,800
The entire institution
of gift-giving makes no sense.

64
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,800
- Too late.
- Let's say I go out

65
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,500
and I spend $50 on you.

66
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,400
It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need,

67
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,200
whereas you know what you need.

68
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Now, I could simplify things...
just give you the $50 directly,

69
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
and then you could give me $50

70
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
on my birthday, and so on,
until one of us dies,

71
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,400
leaving the other one old
and $50 richer.

72
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,700
And I ask you, is it worth it?

73
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Told you not to ask.

74
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,400
Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

75
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,000
I accept your premise;
I reject your conclusion.

76
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

77
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
- What?
- Just do it.

78
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a non-optional...
social convention.

79
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,600
Oh. Fair enough.

80
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,900
He came with a manual.

81
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,100
Question. How am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,200
I don't drive and the only things
available within walking distance

83
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,200
are a Thai restaurant and a gas station.

84
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
I suppose I could wrap up
an order of mee krob

85
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

86
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,100
Okay let's do this...

87
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,300
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.
Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard

88
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,100
- for about 2 hours.
- No problem.

89
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,500
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,000
What if guests show up?

91
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,800
Entertain them.

92
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
What if they're women?

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,700
Stare at them and make them
feel uncomfortable.

94
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,800
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

95
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,100
So listen, the NuArt
is showing the revised,

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
definitive cut of <i>Blade Runner</i>.

97
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,200
Seen it.

98
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,100
No, you've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.

99
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,900
This one has eight seconds
of previously unseen footage.

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,700
They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

101
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,300
Pass.

102
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,100
Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q & A
with Harrison Ford's body double.

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,500
Look, I'm in the Halo
battle of my life here.

104
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
There's this kid in Copenhagen...
he has no immune system,

105
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,200
so all he does is sit in his bubble
and play Halo 24-seven.

106
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,000
- Can't you play him some other time?
- Not if you believe his doctors.

107
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,700
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
- No.
- Yeah, no.

109
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,400
They have DVDs over there.

110
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,300
Yes, but they have
DVD burners over here.

111
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Leonard needs a DVD burner.

112
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,200
A gift shouldn't be something someone
needs, it should be something fun.

113
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,500
Something
they wouldn't buy for themself.

114
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,400
You mean like a sweater?

115
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a fun sweater.

116
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,300
It's got a bold geometric print.

117
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,000
Is it the geometry that makes it fun?

118
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,800
The point is one of the ways
we show we care about people

119
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

120
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,400
Okay, I see. So, not a DVD burner.

121
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
Exactly.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,700
Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun,

123
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Something like...
An 802-11n wireless router!

124
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,300
Here you go, Copenhagen boy.

125
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,200
How about a taste
of Hans Christian hand grenade?

126
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,900
That could not feel good.

127
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,500
Come on, come... Oh, you clever...

128
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,000
Come on.

129
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Take that!

130
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,000
- What's the matter?
- This granola bar has peanuts in it!

131
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,600
- Oh, my God. Why did you eat it?
- I don't know. It was just there!

132
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,800
If I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

133
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,200
Don't yell at me!
I've got to go to the emergency room!

134
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,500
- Now?!
- No, after my tongue has swollen

135
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,200
to the size of a brisket!

136
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,400
All right, just let me get my keys.

137
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,700
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

138
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,400
The laundry is out of the hamper.

139
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,400
Okay, Sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

140
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
Fine. It's out of the washer!

141
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

142
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,800
All right, let's go.

1
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,900
- What do you think?
- That one.

2
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,300
Because of the two
additional Ethernet ports?

3
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,600
- Sure.
- No need,

4
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,800
he's already got
a six-port Ethernet switch.

5
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
- Okay, then this one.
- Why?

6
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

7
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,400
Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard
a gift, I'm going to do it right.

8
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,600
I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

9
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but: What trauma?

10
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,100
On my 12th birthday,

11
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,500
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge

12
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,200
so, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

13
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,700
Of course.

14
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,300
Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

15
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,300
This is hard.

16
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
They got me

17
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,600
a motorized dirt bike.

18
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,500
What 12-year-old boy wants
a motorized dirt bike?

19
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,200
All of them?

20
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,900
- Really?
- Yeah.

21
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,900
So we're getting this one?

22
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,200
- Yeah, I suppose.
- All right, let's go.

23
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,300
Excuse me.
Do you know anything about this stuff?

24
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,600
I know everything about this stuff.

25
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,400
Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business

26
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,900
and I want to hook up
my computer in the front entrance

27
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
with the one in my
refrigerated warehouse.

28
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,500
Buy this one:
it's the one we're getting. Happy guy.

29
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,100
No, she doesn't want that.

30
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,100
She needs a point-to-point
peer network with a range extender.

31
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,400
Thank you.

32
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,300
Which hard drive do I want...

33
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,100
firewire or USB?

34
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
It depends on what buss
you have available.

35
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,400
I drive a Chevy Cavalier.

36
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,500
Oh, dear Lord.

37
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,300
- We have to go.
- Not now.

38
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,400
This poor man needs me.
You, hold on. I'll be right with you.

39
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,300
What computer do you have?
And please don't say "a white one."

40
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
- Excuse me.
- Fill this out. Have a seat.

41
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,200
Listen. We're throwing
my friend a surprise party

42
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm supposed to keep him out
of his apartment for 2 hours.

43
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,700
Fill this out and have a seat.

44
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
No, the only way I could
get him to leave

45
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,500
was to tell him I ate a peanut
because I'm allergic to peanuts.

46
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,500
Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

47
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,400
All I need from you is to take me
in the back and give me a Band-Aid

48
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,100
so I can pretend I had a shot of
epinephrine, and you tell my friend

49
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,300
you need to keep me under observation
for 1 hour 1/2.

50
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,800
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

51
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,300
Get out of my ER.

52
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,100
- No, you don't understand.
- I understand, but unfortunately,

53
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,800
this hospital is not equipped
to treat stupid.

54
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

55
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,500
How about if I were to introduce to you

56
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,000
to the man who freed your people?

57
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,300
Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin

58
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
and his five twin brothers,
you are wasting your time.

59
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.

60
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,800
- How are you doing?
- Bad, very bad.

61
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
Really? You don't look like
you're swelling up at all.

62
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
We should just pick up some Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

63
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
- We can't go home.
- Why not?

64
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,800
Because...

65
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,600
because...

66
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Brisket! Brisket!

67
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,200
- Water! Need water!
- I'll be right back.

68
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,400
I've got a problem.

69
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,300
Well, so do I.
You gotta stall Leonard a little longer.

70
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,200
- I don't think I can.
- You have to.

71
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,600
We all have to be there
at the same time to yell surprise.

72
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,500
You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

73
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,700
- Why? Is Leonard okay?
- Leonard's fine. I'm fine.

74
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,500
Thanks for asking, by the way.

75
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,100
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

76
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
I've done my best, but he wants to go
home and I don't know how to stop him.

77
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Okay, how about this?
You keep him there a little longer,

78
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,800
and when you get to the party, I'll
point out which of my friends are easy?

79
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't toy with me, woman.

80
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
I got a hot former fat girl
with no self-esteem,

81
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,700
a girl who punishes her father
by sleeping around

82
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,700
a alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away
from letting you wear her like a hat.

83
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,000
Thy will be done.

84
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

85
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Okay, we don't have that in stock...

86
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,900
but I can special-order it for you.

87
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,400
Him.

88
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Excuse me, sir.
You don't work here.

89
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

90
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
- Sheldon, we have to go.
- Why?

91
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,200
For one thing, we're late for
Leonard's birthday party,

92
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,300
and for another,
I told him to call security.

93
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,000
Good luck.

94
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,800
By the way, a six-year-old
could hack your computer system.

95
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,100
Keep walking.

96
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,400
"1234" is not a secure password.

97
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,300
Excuse me, my friend is having
an allergic reaction to peanuts.

98
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

99
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
Look, sir, we are very
busy here, and I...

100
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,000
Holy crap!

101
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,700
Please help me!

102
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,500
Code four! I need a gurney!

103
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,100
- Right away! Right away!
- Thank you.

104
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,000
Say what you will about the
healthcare system in this country,

105
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,100
but when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.

106
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
I really don't think
the colonoscopy was necessary.

107
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,500
You know, before you got all swollen up,

108
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,300
I actually thought you were trying
to keep me out of the apartment

109
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
so you could throw me a surprise party.

110
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
Right, it's your birthday.
I had no idea it was your birthday.

111
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
I completely forgot.
What a lousy way to spend a birthday.

112
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,900
It's all over now.

113
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,600
There is a party, isn't there?

114
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Maybe.

115
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,700
- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?

116
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,600
You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

117
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah, that's why I did it.

118
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,000
All right.

119
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Here we go.

120
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
My first birthday party.

121
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,900
Dude,

122
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,100
everybody left an hour ago.

123
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,400
Surprise!

1
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,100
Okay, Leonard.
I am at your birthday party.

2
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,700
I don't know where you are,
dude, but it's really kick-ass!

3
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,400
Everyone is very, very drunk and...

4
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,300
And look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off!

5
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,700
That's my friend Carol.

6
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,600
Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.

7
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh, sweet Krishna,
shake that rupee maker!

8
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,100
I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.

9
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,600
It's okay.

10
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,500
Happy birthday, anyways.

11
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,700
When's your birthday?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
