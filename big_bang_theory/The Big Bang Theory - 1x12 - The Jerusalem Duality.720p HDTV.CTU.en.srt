1
00:00:05,046 --> 00:00:07,404
Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,164
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:15,699
Assuming a device could be invented
which would identify

4
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:18,438
the quantum state of matter
of an individual in one location

5
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:21,688
and transmit that pattern to a
distant location for reassembly,

6
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:23,859
you would not have transported
the individual.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,284
You would have destroyed him
in one location

8
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:28,373
and recreated him in another.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,562
How about that.

10
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:35,154
Personally,
I would never use a transporter,

11
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:37,833
because the original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated

12
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:39,954
in order to create a new Sheldon.

13
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:44,864
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

14
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:48,112
No, he would be exactly the same.

15
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:49,901
That is a problem.

16
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:51,763
So you see it too.

17
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:54,849
Dr. Hofstadter. Dr. Cooper.

18
00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:56,225
Dr. Gablehauser.

19
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,727
Gentlemen, I'd like
you to meet Dennis Kim.

20
00:00:59,123 --> 00:01:01,822
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate,

21
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,066
and we're hoping
he'll do his graduate work here.

22
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:07,789
- Graduate work. Very impressive.
- And he's only 15 years old.

23
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,347
Not bad... I, myself,
started graduate school at 14.

24
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:15,203
Well, I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

25
00:01:17,748 --> 00:01:19,135
Advantage: Kim.

26
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,249
I thought maybe you boys
could show Dennis around.

27
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:26,585
Let him see why we're the best physics
research facility in the country.

28
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:28,050
I already know you're not.

29
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,379
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

30
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,389
The string theory research being done
here is nothing but a dead end.

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,953
Excuse me, that is my research,
and it is by no means a dead end.

32
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:41,061
Obviously you don't see it yet,
but trust me, you will.

33
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:45,688
Dennis, we've discussed this.

34
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:47,985
We're in the process
of updating our equipment,

35
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:50,321
and we welcome your input
on our research goals.

36
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:51,986
We've agreed to look the other way

37
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:54,378
if you use up to 20%
of the grant money you attract

38
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,578
to smuggle your grandfather
out of Pyongyang.

39
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:00,257
We want him here, boys.

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,378
- Make it happen.
- Yes, sir.

41
00:02:02,498 --> 00:02:04,285
You can count on us.
We're on it.

42
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:06,504
What the hell do you mean, "dead end"?

43
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:10,047
I mean, the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory

44
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:13,454
could be as large as 10
to the 500th power. In addition...

45
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,095
Look, chocolate milk.

46
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:20,595
I sense a disturbance in the Force.

47
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:23,883
A bad feeling I have about this.

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Season 1 Episode 12:
The Jerusalem Duality

1
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,100
Dennis, how long
have you been in America?

2
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,900
- A year and a half.
- No kidding.

3
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
- You speak English really well.
- So do you.

4
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,800
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

5
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,200
What are you talking about?

6
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,400
That.

7
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,000
He's not wrong.

8
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,300
All right... And this is my office.

9
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
- Is this part of the tour?
- Nope. Goodbye.

10
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,000
Sheldon,
we've hardly shown him anything.

11
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
All right. This is my desk.

12
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
These are my books; this is my door.
Please close it behind you. Goodbye.

13
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,500
Looks like you're doing work
in quantum loop corrections.

14
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,500
Keen observation. Goodbye.

15
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,800
You see where you went wrong, don't you?

16
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,300
Get him out.

17
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,200
Come on. I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

18
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,100
Do I look like I lift weights?

19
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
Not heavy ones.

20
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,800
It's startling you haven't considered

21
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,600
a Lorentz invariant
or field theory approach.

22
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,400
You think I haven't considered it?

23
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,600
You really think
I haven't considered it?

24
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,200
Have you considered it?

25
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,800
- Get him out, Leonard.
- Come on, Dennis.

26
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,800
I'll show you the radiation lab.

27
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,000
You won the Stevenson Award?

28
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,100
Yes. In fact, I am
the youngest person ever to win it.

29
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,700
Really? How old?

30
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
Fourteen and a half.

31
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,500
You were the youngest person
ever to win it.

32
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
It's like looking into an obnoxious
little mirror, isn't it?

33
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,100
This is really delicious, isn't it?

34
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,500
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk, huh?

35
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,100
Sweetie, you are so damaged.

36
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,300
Hey, I'm damaged, too.

37
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,900
How about a hug for Howie?

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,700
Sure. Raj, hug Howard.

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,600
Something you'd like to share?

40
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,700
A tale of woe, perhaps?

41
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,800
15 years old.

42
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,800
Dennis Kim is 15 years old,
and he's already correcting my work.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Today, I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, to...

44
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,700
- You know, that other guy.
- Antonio Salieri?

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,200
Oh God, now even you
are smarter than me.

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,600
You know, you don't have so many friends

47
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,800
that you can afford to
start insulting them.

48
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,800
Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Why waste food?

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,400
In Texas, when a cow goes dry,
they don't keep feeding it, they just...

51
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,300
take her out and shoot
her between the eyes.

52
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

53
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,200
You can't let this kid get to you.

54
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,800
You always knew that someday someone
younger and smarter would come along.

55
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,700
Yes, but I assumed I would've
been dead hundreds of years

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,100
and that there'd be an asterisk
by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

57
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,100
So you've got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

59
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,900
I don't understand exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,300
We liked Leonard.

61
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
What are you gonna do, just give up?

62
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,900
It's what a rational person does
when his entire life's work

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,200
is invalidated
by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

64
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,300
He ceases his fruitless efforts,

65
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,900
he donates his body
to scientific research,

66
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,600
and he waits to die.

67
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,500
I'm confused again.
Is he waiting,

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,100
or do we get to shoot
him between the eyes?

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
I've decided you're right.
My career is not over.

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Great!

71
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Since the arrival of Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless,

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,700
I just have to find something else
to focus on.

73
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,000
Great!

74
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,800
So I've decided.
I'm going to collaborate with you.

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Great.

76
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,500
So what exactly is it you do?

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,600
You chatter on about it all the time,
but I've never really paid attention.

78
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,800
Right now, I'm designing an experiment

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,300
to study the soft component
of cosmic radiation at see level,

80
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
- but I really don't need any help.
- Sure you do.

81
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,100
See, what's this here in the schematic?
Is that a laser array?

82
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,600
- Yes.
- Now...

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,100
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

84
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,600
- It would blow up.
- Are you sure?

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,200
Pretty sure.

86
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,100
"Pretty sure" is not very scientific.

87
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,500
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

88
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,800
I understand that you're going
through a bit of a career cris,

89
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,000
you're searching for some other area

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,100
where you can feel
valuable and productive,

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,700
but I need to tell you something.
I want you to listen carefully.

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,200
- All right.
- Go away.

93
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,300
If you're concerned about
sharing credit with me,

94
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,600
your name can go first...
I'm going.

95
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,500
It's a small, brown paper bag, Ma!

96
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm looking in it right now.

97
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,100
Why would I make that up?
There's no Ding Dong in it.

98
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,500
How are two Ding Dongs tomorrow
gonna help me today?

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,700
So...

100
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,800
This is Engineering, huh?

101
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
I'll talk to you later.

102
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,500
Engineering.

103
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Where the noble semiskilled laborers

104
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,100
execute the vision
of those who think and dream.

105
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,300
Hello, Oompa-Loompas of science.

106
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,700
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

107
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,100
I just came by to say hello.

108
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,000
I've been in this lab for 3 years.
You've never come by to say hello.

109
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,600
Up until now,
I've had better things to do.

110
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
So, what are we making today?

111
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,100
A small payload support structure

112
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,400
for a European science
experimental package

113
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,100
- that's going up on a space shuttle.
- Really? How does it work?

114
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,500
When this is done, it will be
attached to the payload bay,

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,200
and the sensor apparatus
will rest on it.

116
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,500
So, it's a shelf.

117
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,700
No, you don't understand.
During acceleration,

118
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,200
it needs to stay perfectly level
and provide...

119
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,700
Yeah, it's a shelf.

120
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,300
I notice you're using titanium.

121
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,400
They're lighter, cheaper,
and have twice the tensile strength.

123
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,800
There's a diploma in my office

124
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,400
that says I have a
master's in engineering.

125
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,400
You also have a note from your mother
that says, "I love you, Bubula."

126
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,100
But neither of those is a cogent
argument for titanium over nanotubes.

127
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,800
Go away!

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Did Leonard tell you to say that?

129
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
No, I thought of it all by myself.

130
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
That can't be a coincidence.

131
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,900
There must be
some causal link I'm missing.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
Go away!

133
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,300
Curiouser and curiouser.

1
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
- Is he here?
- If he were, I wouldn't be.

2
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,000
Do you know what he did?
He watched me work for 10 min,

3
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,100
and then started to design a simple
piece of software that could replace me.

4
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Is that even possible?

5
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,700
As it turns out, yes.

6
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,400
Something's got to be done about him.

7
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,100
Like what? He'll never be
able to cope with the fact

8
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,400
that some 15-year-old kid is smarter
and more accomplished than he is.

9
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,100
What if something happened to this boy

10
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?

11
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,800
Then our problem would be solved.

12
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Hang on, are we talking
about murdering Dennis Kim?

13
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm not saying no.

14
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,600
We don't have to go that far.
There are other means available.

15
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,900
We can't send him back to North Korea.

16
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
He knows how to get out.

17
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,400
The only thing we need to do
is make this Kim kid lose his focus.

18
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,400
Won't happen. He is not interested
in anything but physics.

19
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,300
- What about biology?
- What?

20
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,100
You know, biology.

21
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,900
The one thing that can completely
derail a world-class mind.

22
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,100
He's 15.

23
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, so? When I was 15,
I met Denise Palmeri

24
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
and my grade point average
fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8.

25
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,700
She was sleeping with you?

26
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
No, I just...

27
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
wasted a lot of time thinking
about what it would be like if she did.

28
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh, good, you're all here.

29
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,000
Look, if the three of you drop

30
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
whatever it is you're working on
and join me,

31
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,900
we could lick cold fusion in less
than a decade. 12 years, tops.

32
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,700
Go away?

33
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Could it be me?

34
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
What's up?

35
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,800
We need a hot 15-year-old Asian girl
with a thing for smart guys.

36
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,400
What?

37
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,900
Howard, that's racist.
Any 15-year-old girl will do the trick.

38
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,400
It's possible she may have
misunderstood us.

39
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Dr. Cooper.
Are we interrupting?

40
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,400
No, please come in.
I think you'll appreciate this.

41
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
This is very exciting.

42
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
- What are you working on?
- Something remarkable.

43
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,800
Since my prospects for the Nobel prize
in physics have disappeared

44
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,600
thank you very much,

45
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,000
I've decided to refocus my efforts

46
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,600
and use my people skills
to win the Nobel peace prize.

47
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
I will solve
the Middle East crisis

48
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,600
by building an exact replica
of Jerusalem

49
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
in the middle of the Mexican desert.

50
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,900
To what end?

51
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,900
It's like the baseball movie.

52
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,900
"Build it and they will come."

53
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Who will come?

54
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,900
The Jewish people.

55
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,800
- What if they don't come?
- We'll make it nice, put out a spread.

56
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,500
Okay, well, speaking of spreads,

57
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,500
we're having a small welcoming party
this afternoon for Mr. Kim

58
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
who's agreed to join us here
at the university.

59
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,500
Of course he has.

60
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,400
The Oracle told us
little Neo was the one.

61
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,000
You can see the matrix, can't you?

62
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, obviously you're very busy
with your...

63
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,900
Come, Dennis.

64
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,900
You'll have to excuse Dr. Cooper.
He's been under a lot of...

65
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,700
He's nuts.

66
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,000
They'll come, they'll settle,
and I'll win the prize.

67
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,700
I really don't understand
your objections, professor Goldfarb.

68
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,500
Why wouldn't the Sonora desert
make a perfectly good promised land?

69
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Go away.

70
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,600
We could call it Nuevo Jerusalem.

71
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Please go away.

72
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,000
Said Pharaoh to Moses.

73
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
Why are all these young women here?

74
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,500
It's Take Your Daughter To Work Day.

75
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Really?
I was not aware of that.

76
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,500
Yes. There was a very official e-mail

77
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,200
sent to everyone
whose insurance files indicated

78
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,900
they had daughters between
the ages of 14 and 16.

79
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,900
- Smooth.
- Thank you.

80
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
There's the man of the hour.

81
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,900
Okay, so we now have
a socially-awkward genius

82
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,300
in a room full of attractive,
age-appropriate women.

83
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,800
All he has to do now is
hook up with one of them.

84
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,100
Anyone else see the flaw in this plan?

85
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,100
- We need a social catalyst.
- Like what?

86
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,400
We can't get 15-year-old girls drunk.

87
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,100
- Or can we?
- No, we can't.

88
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,300
I don't think you mean "we can't."
I think you mean "we shouldn't."

89
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,700
You're a Jew.
If there was another Wailing Wall

90
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
exactly like the one in Jerusalem

91
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,200
but close to taco stands
and cheap prescription drugs,

92
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
would you still be able to wail at it?

93
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,300
Okay, it's definitely me.

94
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,400
We cannot leave this to chance.
Let's pick a girl

95
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,400
and figure out how to get her
together with Dennis.

96
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,300
How about that one?

97
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,200
I know the type.

98
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,500
Cheerleader, student council,
goes out with the jocks,

99
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
won't even look at anybody
in the gifted program.

100
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,200
If after 2 years of begging,
she agrees to go out with you,

101
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,200
it turns out to be a setup and you're
in your mom's car with your pants off

102
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
while the whole football team
laughs at y...

103
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,000
- Are you crying?
- No, I have allergies.

104
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,900
Okay...

105
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
How about her?

106
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Sure, if he wants to spend two years

107
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,700
doing her homework
while she drinks herself into a stupor

108
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,300
with nonfat White Russians.

109
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
You're holding her head
out of the toilet while she's puking

110
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,100
and telling you she wishes
"more guys were like you."

111
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,300
Then she gets into Cornell
because you wrote her essay

112
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
for her and you drive up
to visit her one weekend

113
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
and she acts
like she doesn't even know you.

114
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,200
Okay, so not her, either.

115
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,100
How about her?

116
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,200
Interesting,
kind of pretty,

117
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,700
a little chubby,
so probably low self-esteem.

118
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,400
I think that's our girl.
One of us should go talk to her.

119
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
I can't talk to her... you do it.

120
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,800
I can't just go up and talk to her.
Howard, you talk to her.

121
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,000
She'll never go for the kid
once she gets a peek at this.

122
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,100
In India, this would be simpler.

123
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,400
5 min with her dad, 20 goats
and a laptop, and we'd be done.

124
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,300
- We're not in India.
- Why don't we do it your way then?

125
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,100
We'll arrange for this girl
to move in across the hall from Dennis

126
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,800
so he can pathetically
moon over her for months on end.

127
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,600
- Okay, that was uncalled for.
- You started it, dude.

128
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,800
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

129
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,700
What a wonderful occasion this is,

130
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
and how fortunate
that it should happen to fall

131
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,200
on Take Your Daughter to Work Day.

132
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,800
We're here to welcome
Mr. Dennis Kim to our little family.

133
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,700
Welcome, Dennis Kim.

134
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,300
Mr. Kim

135
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,400
was not only the valedictorian
at Stanford University,

136
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
he is also the youngest recipient

137
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,600
of the prestigious Stevenson Award.

138
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,900
Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!

139
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,100
And now, without any further ado,

140
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,500
let me introduce
the man of the hour,

141
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,300
Mr. Dennis Kim.

142
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,100
What?!

143
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,600
Would you like to tell us a little bit
about your upcoming research?

144
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,400
No, thanks.
I'm going to the mall with Emma.

145
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
The kid got a girl.

146
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,300
Unbelievable.

147
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,000
Did anyone see how he did it?

148
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,600
Don't worry, I've got this.

149
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Ladies and gentlemen,

150
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,600
honored daughters,

151
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,400
while Mr. Kim,
by virtue of his youth and naivete,

152
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,700
has fallen prey to the inexplicable need
for human contact,

153
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,700
let me step in and assure you that
my research will go on uninterrupted,

154
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,700
and that social relationships
will continue to baffle and repulse me.

155
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,500
Thank you.

156
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
- He's back.
- Mission accomplished.

157
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,000
Forget the mission. How did
that little yutz get a girl on his own?

158
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,100
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

159
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,000
Smart is the new sexy.

160
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,900
Then why do we go home
alone every night? We're still smart.

161
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,100
Maybe we're too smart.

162
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
So smart it's off-putting.

163
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,100
Yeah, let's go with that.

1
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,200
Unbelievable.

2
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,100
Components I built
are on the International Space Station

3
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,800
and I get a ticket for launching
a model rocket in the park.

4
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,200
I don't know if the ticket was
so much for the launch

5
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
as it was for you telling
the policewoman,

6
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,300
"You have to frisk me.
I have another rocket in my pants."

7
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,100
Look at that.

8
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,400
It's Dennis Kim.

9
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,500
I almost didn't recognize him.

10
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

11
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,700
Yeah, we really ruined his life.

12
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Screw him...
He was weak.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
