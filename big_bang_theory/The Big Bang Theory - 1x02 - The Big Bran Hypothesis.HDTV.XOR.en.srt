1
00:00:00,552 --> 00:00:02,513
Here we go.
Pad thai, no peanuts.

2
00:00:02,633 --> 00:00:03,969
But does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:05,342
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:08,056
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,107
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:15,926
- Are there any chopsticks.
- No need. This is Thai food.

7
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,252
Here we go.

8
00:00:17,498 --> 00:00:20,227
Thailand has had the fork since
the latter half of the 19th Century.

9
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,645
Interestingly  they don't put the fork
in their mouth--

10
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:25,780
they use it to put the food on a spoon
which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:27,314 --> 00:00:29,014
Ask him for a napkin.
I dare you.

12
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:32,174
I'll get it.

13
00:00:32,776 --> 00:00:34,467
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:36,377 --> 00:00:37,827
- Hey, Leonard.
- Oh, hi, Penny.

15
00:00:37,947 --> 00:00:40,366
- Am I interrupting?
- No. You're not swelling, Howard.

16
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:43,109
Look at my fingers.
They're like Vienna sausages.

17
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:46,649
- Sounds like you have company.
- They're not going anywhere.

18
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:50,659
So, you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

19
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,415
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory.

20
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,528
People order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

21
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:59,424
So you kind of act like
a carbohydrate delivery system.

22
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,804
Yeah. Call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

23
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,231
I was wondering if you could help me out

24
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:09,684
- with something.
- Yes.

25
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:12,343
Great. I'm having some furniture

26
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:14,433
delivered tomorrow
and I may not be here, so...

27
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:17,849
Hello.

28
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:24,151
- I'm sorry?
- Haven't you ever been told

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,039
how beautiful you are
in flawless Russian?

30
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:27,844
No, I haven't.

31
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:29,024
Get used to it.

32
00:01:30,182 --> 00:01:31,747
Yeah. I probably won't.

33
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:33,871
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Hi.

34
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,118
Hey, Raj.

35
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:38,819
Still not talking to me, huh?

36
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,109
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

37
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:42,493
He can't talk to women.

38
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,813
It can't talk to atractive woman,
or in your case,

39
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:46,818
a cheesecake- scented goddess.

40
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:49,788
So there's gonna be
some furniture delivered?

41
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,006
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign

42
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,839
and have them put it in my apartment?

43
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,065
No problem.

44
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,938
Great. Here's my spare key.
Thank you.

45
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:00,554
Penny, wait.

46
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:06,442
If you don't have any other plans,
do you want to join us

47
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,747
for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

48
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:11,740
A marathon?
How many Superman movies are there?

49
00:02:12,405 --> 00:02:13,791
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,713
I do like the one where Lois Lane
falls from the helicopter

51
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,425
and Superman swooshes down
and catches her. Which one was that?

52
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,656
One.

53
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:25,759
You realize that scene
was rife with scientific inaccuracy.

54
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,978
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

55
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,679
No.
Let's assume that they can.

56
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,622
Lois Lane is falling,

57
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:35,412
accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second per second.

58
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,611
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

59
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,460
Miss Lane, who is now traveling

60
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:42,254
at approximately 120 miles an hour,

61
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:45,040
hits them and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:50,887
Unless Superman matches
her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:54,341
In what space, sir?
She's two feet above the ground.

64
00:02:55,147 --> 00:02:57,671
Frankly, if he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

65
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,237
It'd be a more merciful death.

66
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:04,170
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption

67
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:06,473
that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

68
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,786
Are you listening  to yourself?
It is well established

69
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,465
that his flight is a feat of strength.

70
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:12,869
It is an extension of his
ability to leap tall buildings,

71
00:03:12,996 --> 00:03:15,439
an ability he derives from
exposure to Earth's yellow sun.

72
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,266
And how does he fly at night?

73
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:19,720
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection

74
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:22,421
and the energy-storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

75
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:25,661
I'm just gonna go wash up.

76
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,141
I have 2,600 comic books in there.
I challenge you

77
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,511
to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

78
00:03:31,722 --> 00:03:33,003
Challenge accepted.

79
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:38,120
We're locked out.

80
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,418
Also, the pretty girl left.

88

Her apartment's on the fourth floor
but the elevator's broken, so...

89
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,354
You're just gonna be done?
Okay. Cool. Thanks

90
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:14,488
We'll just bring it up ourselves.

91
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,012
I hardly think so.

92
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:18,443
Why not?

93
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:20,554
Well, we don't have a dolly,

94
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:24,185
or lifting belts
or any measurable upper-body strength.

95
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:27,372
We don't need strength--
we're physicists.

96
00:04:27,855 --> 00:04:30,145
We are the intellectual
descendants of Archimedes.

97
00:04:30,309 --> 00:04:32,528
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

98
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:34,534
It's just a matter of...
I don't have this.

99
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:38,095
Archimedes would be so proud.

100
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:46,429
Do you have any ideas?

101
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,759
Yes, but they all involve
a green lantern and a power ring.

102
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:54,149
Easy... easy.

103
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:02,162
Now we've got an inclined plane.
The force required to lift

104
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,397
is reduced by the sine
of the angle of the stairs,

105
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,100
call it 30 degrees, so, about half.

106
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,872
Exactly half.

107
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:11,109
Exactly half.

108
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,813
Let's push.

109
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,766
See, it's moving, this is easy.

110
00:05:20,436 --> 00:05:21,646
It's all in the math.

111
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:25,024
- What's your formula for the corner?
- What?

112
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:32,601
Okay, no problem.

113
00:05:32,824 --> 00:05:34,620
Just come up here,
help me pull and turn.

114
00:05:39,676 --> 00:05:42,040
Ah, gravity,
thou art a heartless bitch.

115
00:05:44,486 --> 00:05:47,962
You do understand that our efforts here
will in no way increase the odds

116
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:50,063
of you having sexual congress
with this woman.

117
00:05:51,482 --> 00:05:53,832
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

118
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:56,071
Those would be men who just had sex.

119
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,752
I'm doing this
to be a good neighbor.

120
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:03,180
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

121
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:07,232
Almost there.

122
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,209
Almost there.

123
00:06:10,277 --> 00:06:11,792
- Almost there.
- No, we're not.

124
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,689
- I'm sorry.
- No, we're not!

125
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:16,945
Watch your fingers.

126
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:18,681
Oh, God, my fingers!

127
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,796
- You okay?
- No, her...

128
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,667
Great Caesar's ghost,
look at this place.

129
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:29,487
So Penny's a little messy.

130
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,205
A little messy?

131
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,430
The Mandelbrot set of complex
numbers is a little messy.

132
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:35,661
This is chaos.

133
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:37,398
Excuse me.

134
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,538
Explain to me
an organizational system

135
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:41,756
where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid.

136
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:44,546
I'm just inferring this is a couch

137
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:46,579
because the evidence suggests
the coffee table

138
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,117
is having a tiny garage sale.

139
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:51,841
Did it ever occur to you
that not everyone has

140
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,201
the compulsive need to sort,
organize and label

141
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,742
the entire world around them?

142
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:57,743
No.

143
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:00,298
Well, they don't.

144
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,253
Hard as it may be for you to believe,

145
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:05,782
most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

146
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,914
Excuse me, but I think we've both
found that helpful at times.

147
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,412
- Come on, we should go.
- Hang on.

148
00:07:17,275 --> 00:07:19,435
- What are you doing?
- I'm straightening up.

149
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,722
This is not your home.

150
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,408
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

151
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,750
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

152
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:32,430
Because it was immaculate.

153
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,691
I mean, you opened
that man's closet,

154
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,476
it was left to right evening gowns,

155
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,801
cocktail dresses,
then his police uniforms.

156
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,895
What were you doing in his closet?

157
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,117
I helped him run
some cable for a web cam.

158
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:48,472
This just arrived,
we just brought this up... just now.

159
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,857
Great.
Was it hard getting it up the stairs?

160
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,321
- No.
- "No"?

161
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,566
No.

162
00:07:54,027 --> 00:07:55,037
No.

163
00:07:56,147 --> 00:07:57,718
Well, we'll get out of your hair.

164
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,297
Okay, great.
Thank you again.

165
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:07,062
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

166
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,370
I'm here for you.

167
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,125
What's he talking about?

168
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,128
- It's a joke.
- I don't get it.

169
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,743
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

170
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,573
Penny's sleeping.

171
00:09:18,073 --> 00:09:19,184
Are you insane?

172
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:21,173
You can't just break
into a woman's apartment

173
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,928
in the middle
of the night and clean.

174
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:25,591
I had no choice.
I couldn't sleep knowing

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,737
that just outside my bedroom
was our living room,

176
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,977
and just outside our living room
was that hallway,

177
00:09:30,118 --> 00:09:32,947
and immediately adjacent
to the hallway was... this.

178
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:37,020
Do you realize
that if Penny wakes up,

179
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:39,998
there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here.

180
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:42,732
I just gave you
a reasonable explanation.

181
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,860
No, no, you gave me
an explanation.

182
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:49,308
Its reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

183
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:52,617
Don't be ridiculous.
I have no peers.

184
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:55,037
We have to get out of here.

185
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,847
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

186
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:02,325
What?

187
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:04,790
Evolution has made women sensitive

188
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,609
to high-pitched noises
while they sleep

189
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,782
so that they'll be
roused by a crying baby.

190
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,475
If you want to avoid waking her,

191
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,365
speak in a lower register.

192
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,605
That's ridiculous!

193
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:19,871
No.

194
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,278
"That's ridiculous."

195
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:26,689
Fine.

196
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,476
I accept your premise.
Now, please, let's go.

197
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,813
I'm not leaving until I'm done.

198
00:10:38,316 --> 00:10:41,170
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

199
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,727
Oh, what the hell.

200
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,788
Morning.

201
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,523
Morning.

202
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:58,346
I have to say
I slept splendidly.

203
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:02,102
Granted, not long,
but just deeply and well.

204
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,115
I'm not surprised.

205
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,941
A well-known folk cure for insomnia

206
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,771
is to break in your neighbor's
apartment and clean.

207
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:10,907
Sarcasm?

208
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
You think?

209
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:16,051
Granted, my methods may have
been somewhat unorthodox,

210
00:11:16,313 --> 00:11:19,002
but I think the end result
will be a measurable enhancement

211
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:21,520
- to Penny's quality of life
- You've convinced me.

212
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:24,321
Maybe tonight we should sneak in
and shampoo her carpet.

213
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,665
- You don't think that crosses a line?
- Yes.

214
00:11:27,985 --> 00:11:29,221
For God's sake,

215
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:33,153
do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

216
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,291
You have a sarcasm sign?

217
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,243
No, I do not have
a sarcasm sign.

218
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,480
Do you want some cereal?
I feel so good today,

219
00:11:43,634 --> 00:11:45,846
I'm gonna choose from
the low-fiber end of the shelf.

220
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,416
Hello, Honey Puffs.

221
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,696
Son of a bitch!

222
00:11:51,725 --> 00:11:52,725
Penny's up.

223
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:56,120
You sick geeky bastards!

224
00:11:57,641 --> 00:11:59,299
How did she know it was us?

225
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,995
I may have left a suggested
organizational schematic

226
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:04,404
for her bedroom closet.

227
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:07,383
God, this is gonna be bad.

228
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:09,853
Good-bye, Honey Puffs.
Hello, Big Bran.

229
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,622
You came into my apartment last
night while I was sleeping?!

230
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,028
Yes, but only to clean.

231
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,821
Really more to organize.
You're not actually dirty, per se.

232
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,322
Give me back my key.

233
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,019
I'm very, very sorry.

234
00:12:23,193 --> 00:12:25,106
Do you understand
how creepy this is?

235
00:12:25,382 --> 00:12:27,466
Oh, yes, we discussed it
at length last night.

236
00:12:27,891 --> 00:12:30,087
In my apartment,
while I was sleeping?!

237
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:33,364
And snoring. And that's probably
just a sinus infection.

238
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,030
But it could be sleep apnea.

239
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,147
You might want to see
an otolaryngologist.

240
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:41,086
A throat doctor.

241
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:45,727
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

242
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:48,199
Depending on the depth,

243
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:51,010
that's either
a... proctologist

244
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,673
or a general surgeon.

245
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,447
I think what you're feeling

246
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:07,540
is perfectly valid
and maybe a little bit later

247
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:10,779
when you're feeling a little less...
for lack of a better word-- violated,

248
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,537
maybe we can talk
about this some more.

249
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,975
- Stay away from me.
- Sure, that's another way to go.

250
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,193
Penny, Penny!

251
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,078
Just to clarify,

252
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,693
because there will be
a discussion when you leave,

253
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,049
is your objection
solely to our presence

254
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:26,979
in the apartment
while you were sleeping,

255
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:31,475
or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm.

256
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,995
Well, that was
a little non-responsive.

257
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:43,659
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

258
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:49,758
What's funny?

259
00:13:50,154 --> 00:13:51,786
That wasn't sarcasm?

260
00:13:54,571 --> 00:13:57,156
Boy, you are all over
the place this morning.

261
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,936
I have a master's and two Ph.D.s,
I should not have to do this.

262
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:06,288
What?!

263
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,177
I am truly sorry for what
happened last night.

264
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:10,865
I take full responsibility.

265
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:13,844
And I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard,

266
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:17,559
who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear,

267
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,494
a gentle and
thorough lover.

268
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,586
I did what I could.

269
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:39,387
Hey, Raj.

270
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:45,859
Hey, listen.

271
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:48,738
I don't know if you heard about
what happened last night.

272
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:50,314
but I'm really upset about it.

273
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,644
I mean, they just...
they let themselves into my place

274
00:14:52,835 --> 00:14:55,029
and then they cleaned it.
Can you even believe that?

275
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:56,360
How weird is that?

276
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,456
<i>She's standing very close to me.</i>

277
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,531
<i>Oh, my, she does smell good.</i>

278
00:15:01,923 --> 00:15:03,737
<i>What is that, vanilla?</i>

279
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,230
You know,
where I come from,

280
00:15:06,474 --> 00:15:09,365
if someone comes into your house
at night, you shoot. Okay?

281
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,851
And you don't shoot to wound.

282
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:12,868
I mean, all right,
my sister shot her husband,

283
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,742
but it was an accident,
they were drunk.

284
00:15:15,755 --> 00:15:17,163
Wait, what was I saying?

285
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:19,498
<i>She's so chatty.</i>

286
00:15:20,676 --> 00:15:22,026
<i>Maybe my parents are right.</i>|

287
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:24,365
<i>Maybe I'd be better off
with an Indian girl.</i>

288
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,195
<i>We'd have the same
cultural background</i>

289
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:29,742
<i>and my wife could sing to my children
the same lullabies my mother sang to me.</i>

290
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:31,837
It's obvious that they meant well,
but...

291
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,739
I'm having a really rough time.
I broke up with my boyfriend

292
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:36,418
and...

293
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:44,608
Just because most of the men I've known
in my life happen to be jerks,

294
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,583
doesn't mean I should just
assume Leonard and Sheldon are.

295
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:48,842
Right?

296
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:51,806
<i>She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.</i>

297
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,780
That's exactly what I thought.

298
00:15:55,979 --> 00:15:58,180
Thank you for listening.
You're a doll.

299
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,000
Turn your pelvis.

300
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,243
Grab a napkin, homie.
You just got served.

301
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:22,930
It's fine.You win.

302
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:25,887
What's his problem?

303
00:16:26,371 --> 00:16:28,571
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

304
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:31,571
Been there.

305
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:36,433
Sorry I'm late,

306
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,859
but I was in the hallway,
chatting up Penny.

307
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,858
Really? You, Rajesh
Koothrappali, spoke to Penny?

308
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,890
Actually, I was less
the chatter than the chat-ee.

309
00:16:46,703 --> 00:16:48,718
What did she say?
Is she still mad at me?

310
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,391
Well, she was upset at first,

311
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:53,094
but probably because
her sister shot somebody.

312
00:16:55,438 --> 00:16:57,213
But then there was
something about you,

313
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:58,756
and then she hugged me.

314
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,702
She hugged you?
How'd she hug you?

315
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,146
Is that her perfume I smell?

316
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:15,999
Intoxicating, isn't it?

317
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:33,879
Hi.

318
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,262
What's going on?

319
00:17:39,697 --> 00:17:40,912
Here's the thing.

320
00:17:47,564 --> 00:17:50,025
"Just as Oppenheimer came
to regret his contributions

321
00:17:50,198 --> 00:17:51,691
"to the first atomic bomb,

322
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:54,161
"so too I regret
my participation in what was,

323
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,381
"at the very least,
an error in judgment.

324
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,072
"The hallmark of the
great human experiment

325
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:02,238
"is the willingness to
recognize one's mistakes.

326
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:04,734
"Some mistakes, such as
Madam Curie's discovery of radium,

327
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:06,757
"turned out to have great
scientific potential,

328
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:10,194
"even though she would later die a slow,
painful death "from radiation poisoning.

329
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:15,193
Another example, from the
field of Ebola research..."

330
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:22,224
We're okay.

331
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,401
- Six two inch dowels.
- Check.

332
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,474
- One package Phillips head screws.
- Check.

333
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,596
You guys, seriously,
I grew up on a farm, okay?

334
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,854
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 12.

335
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,373
I think I can put together a cheap,
Swedish media center.

336
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:55,455
No, please. We insist.
It's the least we can do, considering.

337
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,941
Considering what?

338
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,954
How great this place looks?

339
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:02,404
- Oh, boy. I was afraid of this.
- What?

340
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,399
These instructions are
a pictographic representation

341
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,430
of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

342
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,901
This, right here is why Sweden
has no space program.

343
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,287
Well, it looked
pretty good in the store.

344
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,399
It is an inefficient design.
For example, she has a flat screen TV,

345
00:19:17,553 --> 00:19:19,522
which means all the space
behind it is wasted.

346
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:22,277
- We could put her stereo back there.
- And control it how?

347
00:19:22,468 --> 00:19:23,808
Run an infrared repeater.

348
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,187
Photo cell here, emitter here,
easy-peasy.

349
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,961
How are you gonna cool it?

350
00:19:29,096 --> 00:19:31,230
- Hey, guys, I got this.
- Hang on, Penny.

351
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,831
How about fans?
Here and here.

352
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,871
Also inefficient,
and might be loud.

353
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,430
How about liquid coolant?
Maybe a little aquarium pump here,

354
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,104
run some quarter-inch PVC...

355
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,124
Guys, this is actually really simple.

356
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:44,578
Hold on, honey.
Men at work.

357
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,383
The PVC comes down here.

358
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:50,794
Maybe a little corrugated
sheet metal as a radiator here.

359
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,124
Yeah? Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice, and an overflow reservoir.

360
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:57,277
If water's involved, we're gonna have
to ground the crap out of the thing.

361
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,130
It's hot in here. I think
I'll just take off all my clothes.

362
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:06,858
Oh, I've got it.

363
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:09,714
What about if we replace

364
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:13,521
panels A, B and F and crossbar H
with aircraft-grade aluminum?

365
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,617
Right. Then the entire thing
is one heat sink.

366
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:17,633
You and Sheldon
go to the junkyard and pick up

367
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,138
6 square meters of scrap aluminum?

368
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,147
Raj and I
will get the oxyacetylene torch.

369
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,872
- Meet back here in an hour?
- Done.

370
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,997
Okay, this place does look pretty good.

371
00:20:30,555 --> 00:20:31,944
