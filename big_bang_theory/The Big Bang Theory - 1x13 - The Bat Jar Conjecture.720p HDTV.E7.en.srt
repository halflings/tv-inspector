1
00:00:01,065 --> 00:00:03,048
More details about
the new <i>Star Trek</i> film.

2
00:00:03,507 --> 00:00:06,897
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.

3
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:10,472
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:12,779
Oh, please.

5
00:00:12,899 --> 00:00:16,274
For Vulcans, mating...
or if you will, PonFahr...

6
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:21,002
- it's an extremely private matter.
- Still, I'd like to know the details.

7
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,047
His mother was human.
His father is Vulcan.

8
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:25,832
- They couldn't just conceive.
- Maybe they had to go to a clinic.

9
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:27,944
Can you imagine Spock's Dad
in a little room

10
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,599
with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears.

11
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,829
How come on <i>Star Trek</i>
everybody's private parts are the same?

12
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:39,533
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,737
Hi. Can you help me?

14
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:46,119
I was writing an e-mail
and the "A" key got stuck.

15
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,960
Now it's just going "Aaa..."

16
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:51,263
- What'd you spill on it?
- Nothing.

17
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,305
Diet Coke.

18
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,202
And yogurt.

19
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:58,269
And a little nail polish.

20
00:00:58,431 --> 00:00:59,896
I'll take a look at it.

21
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:03,130
Gentlemen,
switching to local nerd news...

22
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,157
Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team

23
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:08,154
in the university Physics Bowl
this year.

24
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:09,655
You're kidding. Why not?

25
00:01:09,816 --> 00:01:12,252
They formed a barbershop quartet
and got a gig

26
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,145
playing Knott's Berry Farm.

27
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:17,234
So, in your world,

28
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,462
you're like the cool guys.

29
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:21,885
Recognize.

30
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:26,321
This is our year.
With those guys out,

31
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,549
the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.

32
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:30,047
Zod?

33
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,886
Kryptonian villain. Long story.

34
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,087
Good story.

35
00:01:36,718 --> 00:01:38,976
- Count me out.
- What? Why?

36
00:01:39,345 --> 00:01:42,355
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?

37
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:45,388
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?

38
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:48,896
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?

39
00:01:49,858 --> 00:01:52,559
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?

40
00:01:54,027 --> 00:01:57,040
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,288
By that reasoning we should also
play Bridge, hold up a chuppah

42
00:02:00,408 --> 00:02:02,838
and enter the Olympic
bobsled competition.

43
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,253
Tickets to that, please.

44
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,174
Sheldon, what, do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?

45
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:11,468
No, don't.

46
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,054
"The needs of the many...

47
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:16,221
"... outweigh the needs of the few.

48
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:17,445
"Or the one."

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,937
Damn it, I'll do it.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,100
Season 1 Episode 13:
The Bat Jar Conjecture

1
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
First order of Physics Bowl business.

2
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,100
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?

3
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,900
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?

4
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,900
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads-up for the ladies.

5
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,600
The ladies?

6
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,800
"Perpetual Motion Squad...
we can go all night."

7
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,500
- I like it.
- I don't.

8
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,500
Teams are traditionally
named after fierce creatures,

9
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,700
thus intimidating one's opponent.

10
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,500
- Then we could be the Bengal tigers.
- Poor choice.

11
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,700
Gram for gram,
no animal exceeds

12
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,400
the relative fighting strength
of the army ant.

13
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,300
Maybe so,

14
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,500
but you can't incinerate a Bengal tiger
with a magnifying glass.

15
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Let's put it to a vote.
All those in favor...

16
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,300
Point of order.

17
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,900
I move that any vote on team names
must be unanimous.

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,700
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger

19
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,600
when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.

20
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,600
Will the gentleman from the great
State of Denial yield for a question?

21
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
I will yield.

22
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,400
After we go through the exercise
of an annoying series of votes,

23
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
all of which the gentleman will lose,
does he then intend to threaten to quit

24
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
- if he does not get his way?
- He does.

25
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,000
I move we are the Army Ants.
All those in favor?

26
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,600
Good afternoon, and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.

27
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,400
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,800
because apparently
I didn't have anything else to do

29
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,200
on a Saturday afternoon,
and isn't that just a little sad?

30
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,300
Gentlemen, ready?

31
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,900
- Yes.
- Fire away.

32
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's none of my business,
but isn't a guy

33
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,800
who can't speak in front of women
gonna hold you back a little?

34
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,400
He'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.

35
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.

36
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,500
Thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.

37
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,900
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.

38
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,300
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.

39
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,600
"What is the shortest
light pulse ever produced?"

40
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,100
- Dr. Cooper.
- And of course,

41
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,900
the answer is 130 attoseconds.

42
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
- That is correct.
- I knew that, too.

43
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question:

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
"What is the quantum mechanical effect

45
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,000
"used to encode data
on hard-disk drives?"

46
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,200
And of course the answer is
giant magnetoresistance.

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,200
- Right.
- Hey, I buzzed in.

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,800
And I answered.
It's called teamwork.

49
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,300
Don't you think I should answer
the engineering questions?

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
I am an engineer.

51
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,400
By that logic I should answer
all the anthropology questions

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,000
because I'm a mammal.

53
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,200
Just ask another one.

54
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,900
"What artificial satellite
has seen glimpses

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
of Einstein's predicted
frame dragging?"

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,300
And of course,
it's Gravity Probe B.

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.

58
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,400
Why?

59
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Because it's polite.

60
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
What do manners
have to do with it?

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
This is war.

62
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,300
Were the Romans polite
when they salted the ground of Carthage

63
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.

65
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,600
The objective of the competion
is to give correct answers.

66
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?

67
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,400
Some of us might have
the correct answers, too.

68
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
Oh, please.
You don't even have a PhD.

69
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,000
- All right, that's it!
- Howard, sit down.

70
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
- Maybe we should take a little break.
- Good idea. I need my wrist brace.

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,700
All this button-pushing
is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.

72
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,100
I agree.

73
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,800
What did he say?

74
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,500
He compared Sheldon

75
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,700
to a disposable feminine
cleansing product

76
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
one might use
on a summer's eve.

77
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,300
Yeah, and the bag it came in.

78
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,100
Leonard, excellent.
I want to show you something.

79
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,100
Can it wait?
I need to talk to you.

80
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,600
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.

81
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,100
The colors are based
on <i>Star Trek: The Original Series</i>.

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,700
The three of you will wear Support Red,
and I will wear Command Gold.

83
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,000
Why do they say "AA"?

84
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,700
Army Ants.

85
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,900
Isn't that confusing? "AA" might mean
something else to certain people.

86
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,100
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?

87
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,400
No, I meant...

88
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Never mind.

89
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Check it out,

90
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,200
I got you a <i>Batman</i> cookie jar.

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,400
Oh, neat!
What's the occasion?

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, you're a friend,
and you like <i>Batman</i>

93
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,300
and cookies,
and you're off the team.

94
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,600
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,200
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, we did. I just came from there.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,500
Okay, I don't know
where you just came from,

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
but it could'nt have been a team meeting
because I wasn't there.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Ergo, the team did not meet.

100
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay, let me try it this way:

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,100
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends,

102
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,500
and one thing led to another,
and it turns out you're off the team.

103
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Why?

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,900
Because you're taking
all the fun out of it.

105
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics
Bowl the team that has the most fun?

106
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,900
Okay, let me try it this way:

107
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,300
You're annoying and no one
wants to play with you anymore.

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,500
I see.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
At this point I should inform you

110
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,700
that I intend to form my own team

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,200
and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together

112
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,300
and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.

113
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,700
Thanks for the heads-up.

114
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
You're welcome.

115
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,700
- One more thing.
- Yes?

116
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,100
It's on, bitch.

1
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,700
- So who'd he get to be on his team?
- He won't say.

2
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
He just smiles and eats
macaroons out of his bat jar.

3
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,300
He's using psychological warfare.

4
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,200
We must reply in kind.
I say we wait until he looks at us,

5
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,900
then laugh like, "Yes, you are
a smart and strong competitor,

6
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,900
"but we are also smart and strong,

7
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,700
and we have a reasonable
chance of defeating you."

8
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
How exactly would that laugh go?

9
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,700
That sounds more like,
"We are a tall, thin woman

10
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,400
who wants to make a
coat out of your Dalmatians."

11
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,100
Let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.

12
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,100
So?

13
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
So nothing.
Let's destroy him.

14
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
Gentlemen.

15
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,900
We're going to need
a strong fourth for our team.

16
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,800
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played <i>TV's Blossom</i>.

17
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
She got a PhD. in neuroscience
or something.

18
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Raj, we're not getting <i>TV's Blossom</i>
to join our Physics Bowl team.

19
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,100
How about the girl
from <i>The Wonder Years</i>?

20
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,500
Gentlemen, I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.

21
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,600
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

22
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,600
Why? Because you slept together,
and when she was done with you

23
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
she discarded you
like last night's chutney?

24
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,200
Yes.

25
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Sometimes you've got
to take one for the team.

26
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,100
Sack up, dude.

27
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,700
Fine.

28
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,800
Here I go, taking one for the team...

29
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,200
in the sack.

30
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,700
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hi, guys.

31
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,200
So, Leslie,
I have a question for you,

32
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,300
and it might be a little awkward,
you know, given that I...

33
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,900
Hit that thing.

34
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,700
Leonard, there's no reason
to feel uncomfortable

35
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,700
just because we've seen
each other's faces

36
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,900
and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

37
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
There's not?

38
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,100
Gee, 'cause it sure sounds
like there should be.

39
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,600
Rest assured that any aspects
of our sexual relationship

40
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,000
regarding your preferences,
your idiosyncrasies, your performance

41
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
are still protected by the inherent
confidentiality of the bedroom.

42
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,000
That's all very comforting,
but if it's okay,

43
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,100
I'd like to get on
to my question now.

44
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,500
Proceed.

45
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,400
We are entering the Physics Bowl,
and we need a fourth for our team.

46
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,000
No, thanks. I'm really busy with my
like-sign dilepton supersymmetry search.

47
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
Dilepton, shmylepton.
We need you.

48
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,800
Sorry.

49
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
Well, we tried.

50
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,400
We'll just have to face Sheldonmano
y mano y mano a mano.

51
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,500
Wait, you're going up
against Sheldon Cooper?

52
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,600
That arrogant, misogynistic,
East Texas doorknob

53
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,400
that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles

54
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
for laundry and childbearing?

55
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
She's in.

56
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,300
So, how do you feel?

57
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,800
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

58
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,400
Are you ready?

59
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,900
Yeah. You know, you don't have
to stay for the whole thing.

60
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,800
Oh, no. I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

61
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,600
Gentlemen.

62
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm just gonna sit down.

63
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,500
So, is that your team?

64
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,400
Actually, I don't need a team.

65
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,400
I could easily defeat you
single-handedly,

66
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,400
but the rules require four.

67
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
So, may I introduce
the third-floor janitor,

68
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,500
the lady from the lunch room,
and my Spanish is not good...

69
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,400
either her son or her butcher.

70
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,100
And what about your team?

71
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,100
What rat have you recruited
to the S.S. Sinking Ship?

72
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Hello, Sheldon.

73
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Leslie Winkle.

74
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,700
Yeah, Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question,

75
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,500
"Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?"

76
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,800
Well, I'm polymerized tree sap,
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

77
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,700
So whatever verbal projectile
you launch in my direction

78
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,500
is reflected off of me,
returns on its original trajectory

79
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,800
and adheres to you.

80
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, ouch!

81
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,100
Okay, if everyone could
please take your seats.

82
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Here's your T-shirt.

83
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
PMS?

84
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,300
It's a couple days early...

85
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,200
It stands for "Perpetual Motion Squad."

86
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,300
Of course.
What was I thinking?

87
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,700
Good afternoon, everyone,

88
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
and welcome to this year's Physics Bowl!

89
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,300
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams.

90
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,100
AA versus...

91
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,200
PMS.

92
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,300
All night long, y'all!

93
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay, well, let's jump right in.
First question for ten points:

94
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,400
"What is the iso-spin singlet partner

95
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,200
"of the pi-zero meson?"

96
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,100
PMS?

97
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,800
- The eta meson.
- Correct.

98
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,300
- Formal protest.
- On what grounds?

99
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

100
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Denied.
All right, for ten points,

101
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,000
"What is the lightest element on Earth

102
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,900
"with no stable isotope?"

103
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,000
AA?

104
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,100
And of course,
the answer is technetium.

105
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Terrific.

106
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,400
Next question:

107
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,100
"What is the force between
two uncharged plates

108
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,400
"due to quantum vacuum fluctuations?"

109
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,700
PMS?

110
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,300
Sheldon can suck on...
the Casimir effect.

111
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,300
Correct.

112
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,100
How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?

113
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,500
PMS?

114
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,300
- Shor's algorithm.
- Correct!

115
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,500
4.1855 times ten
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

116
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,700
Prevost's theory of exchanges.

117
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,400
Lambda equals one
over pi r squared n.

118
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,600
760 degrees Celsius...

119
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,600
the approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

120
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Mr. Wolowitz,
this is your second warning.

121
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,700
A sigma particle.

122
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,400
Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

123
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Correct!

124
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hold in my hand the final question.

125
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,900
The score now stands.
AA: 1,150,

126
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,200
PMS: 1,175.

127
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
So, for 100 points and the match,

128
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,900
please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

129
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,200
Solve the equation.

130
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Holy crap.

131
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
What the hell is that?

132
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,300
Looks like something
they found on the ship at Roswell.

133
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Come on. Think.
Leslie?

134
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,600
It's not gonna work if you rush me.
You have to let me get there.

135
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,100
You are never gonna
let that go, are you?

136
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,500
Ten seconds.

137
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,500
PMS?

138
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Sorry, I panicked.

139
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,800
Then guess.

140
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,400
Eight.

141
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,300
.4

142
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm sorry, that's incorrect.

143
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,800
AA,

144
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,900
if you can answer correctly,
the match is yours.

145
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,300
He doesn't have it.

146
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,000
He's got squat.

147
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,200
AA, I need your answer.

148
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,000
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

149
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

150
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,400
- What are you doing?
- Answering question.

151
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,900
Winning Physics Bowl.

152
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,900
How do you know anything
about physics?

153
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,500
Here I am janitor.

154
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,500
In former Soviet Union, I am physicist.

155
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Leningrad Politechnika.

156
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,900
Go Polar Bears.

157
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,600
That's a delightful little story,

158
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,300
but our arrangement was that
you sit here and not say anything...

159
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,300
- I answer the questions.
- You didn't answer question.

160
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,500
Look, now, maybe you have
democracy now in your beloved Russia,

161
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,500
but on this Physics Bowl team,
I rule with an iron fist.

162
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,300
AA, I need your official answer.

163
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,600
- It's not what he said.
- Then what is it?

164
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
- I want a different question.
- You can't.

165
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,300
- Formal protest.
- Denied.

166
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,900
Informal protest.

167
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,500
Denied.

168
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,600
- I need your official answer.
- No. I decline to provide one.

169
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,100
That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

170
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
That's your opinion.

171
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,700
- The winner of the match is...
- Hang on.

172
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Is proving that you are single-handedly
smarter than everyone else so important

173
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,300
that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?

174
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
I don't understand the question.

175
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,700
- Go ahead.
- The winner is PMS.

1
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,900
Sorry, somebody's sitting there.

2
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,700
Who?

3
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
My Physics Bowl trophy.

4
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,000
That trophy is meaningless.
I forfeited, therefore you did not win.

5
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,300
- I know someone who would disagree.
- Who?

6
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,700
My Physics Bowl trophy.

7
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,500
Leonard is so smart.

8
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,900
- Sheldon who?
- All right, that is very immature.

9
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,500
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm not!

10
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
- Okay, new contest.
- What are you doing?

11
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,900
I am settling once and for all

12
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,700
who is the smartest around here, okay?

13
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,200
- Ready?
- Absolutely.

14
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Bring it on.

15
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,600
"Marsha, Jan and Cindy
were the three daughters

16
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,100
"in what TV family?"

17
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,700
<i>The Brady Bunch.</i>

18
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,400
"Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth
as the lead singer in what group?"

19
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,500
<i>The Brady Bunch?</i>

20
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>Van Halen.</i>

21
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,400
"Madonna was married
to this Ridgemont High alum."

22
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,900
Oh, my God! Sean Penn!

23
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
How do you know these things?

24
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,800
I go outside,
and I talk to people.

25
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Okay, here.
"What actor holds the record

26
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,800
"for being named <i>People Magazine</i>'s
Sexiest Man Alive?"

27
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,800
- William Shatner.
- Wait.

28
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,200
I don't think it's Shatner.

29
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,500
Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.

30
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,800
Formal protest.

31
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,300
"Singer who sang,
<i>Oops, I Did It Again</i>?"

32
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,200
"Tweetie Bird tought
he taw a what?"

33
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Romulan.

34
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Yes.

35
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,000
He tought he taw a Romulan.
