1
00:00:01,217 --> 00:00:05,210
On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

2
00:00:05,388 --> 00:00:09,290
...it'll create a black hole and swallow up
the Earth, ending life as we know it.

3
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:11,484
What a bunch of crybabies.

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,925
No guts, no glory, man.

5
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:15,854
Hey, check it out.

6
00:00:16,032 --> 00:00:19,058
The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

7
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,703
"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety...

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:26,638
...panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive-compulsive disorder. "

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,774
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

10
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,376
I don't know, Raj.

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:35,916
Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

12
00:00:38,822 --> 00:00:41,222
- What's going on?
- Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

13
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:43,617
Sheldon's office?

14
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,788
Is she lost?

15
00:00:48,264 --> 00:00:51,563
I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,370
- Maybe she's his lawyer.
- Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,098
- Howard...
- I know, I'm disgusting.

18
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,333
I should be punished.

19
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,377
By her. Oh, look, I did it again.

20
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:07,448
Well, that should do it.
- Thank you for coming by.

21
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,388
Hello.

22
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:17,993
Oh, hey, buddy.

23
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:21,390
Buddy?

24
00:01:21,564 --> 00:01:23,930
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project...

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,263
...that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

26
00:01:27,437 --> 00:01:30,338
Well, how can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

27
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,640
Nobody ever expects me.

28
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,778
Sometimes you just look,
and bam, Howard Wolowitz.

29
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:41,342
- Sheldon, are you gonna introduce us?
- Oh, all right. This is Missy.

30
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,181
Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

31
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,687
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, as well also.

32
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,222
Yeah.

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,687
So how do you two know each other?

34
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:57,632
Oh, he once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,195
Excuse me?

36
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,600
She's my twin sister.

37
00:02:03,773 --> 00:02:07,106
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

38
00:02:07,277 --> 00:02:10,075
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

39
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,737
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

40
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,043
A humormometer?

41
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,222
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French say:

42
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:27,719
Okay, so let me see if I got this.
Leonard, Howard and...

43
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:30,161
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

44
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,624
Rajesh.

45
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,183
So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

46
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:28,153
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

47
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,383
My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,859
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

49
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:38,698
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

50
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:42,360
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

51
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:44,836
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

52
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,670
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

53
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:51,172
Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

54
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,510
...and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

55
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,379
Enjoy the wedding. Goodbye.

56
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,482
- Whoa, whoa.
- Whoa, whoa.

57
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,587
If the wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

58
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:05,728
Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

59
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:09,695
Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

60
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,260
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

61
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,568
Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

62
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:20,470
- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

63
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:24,079
So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

64
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:27,414
It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

65
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,608
And don't ever call me Shelly.

66
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,050
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

67
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,657
I'll walk you to your car.
You're in Structure 3, Level C, right?

68
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,761
What just happened?

69
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:44,893
So anyway, we're 8 years old...

70
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:49,437
...and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

71
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,438
That's just classic.

72
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:55,640
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates...

73
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,837
...for homemade integrated circuits.

74
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,711
He was trying to build some sort of
armed robot to keep me out of his room.

75
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,581
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

76
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:09,020
Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

77
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:11,854
Next thing you know,
my eyebrows are gone.

78
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,521
Not your eyebrows?

79
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:18,030
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...

80
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:20,795
...with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

81
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,961
Is that what that was? I just assumed...

82
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:25,630
...that the second-grade curriculum
had rendered you quizzical.

83
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:33,279
Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear
in the drier downstairs.

84
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,182
Pfft.

85
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,320
Those are not mine.

86
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:45,285
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

87
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:48,623
Oh, yeah, no, I use those...

88
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:53,132
...just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

89
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,960
I spearfish.

90
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,338
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

91
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:08,472
Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister.
Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.

92
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:10,676
- Hi.
- Wow, you don't look that much alike.

93
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,378
Can I get a hallelujah?

94
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,081
Fraternal twins
come from two separate eggs.

95
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,489
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

96
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,526
Hallelujah.

97
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,254
Hey, guess what.

98
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:24,696
I've been accepted as a test subject
for a drug...

99
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,028
...to overcome pathological shyness.

100
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:30,297
- Oh, good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful.

101
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,100
Hello, Missy.

102
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:44,218
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

103
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:47,847
So, Missy...

104
00:06:48,024 --> 00:06:52,427
...have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

105
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:57,398
- Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.
- Yes, Patel. Good man.

106
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:00,627
Do you like motorcycles?
Because I ride a hog.

107
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:04,705
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

108
00:07:06,476 --> 00:07:09,809
You still have to wear a helmet.

109
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,314
<i>- Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?
- The sex book.</i>

110
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,451
The Indian sex book.

111
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:19,315
In other words, if you wonder, wonder
who wrote the book of love...

112
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,252
...it was us.

113
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:26,187
- So Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

114
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,823
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,467
Oh. Eh...

116
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:36,935
Maybe. If you like women who are tall.

117
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,734
And perfect.

118
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,007
Sheldon,
why are you ignoring your sister?

119
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,173
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

120
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:49,841
I brought snacks.

121
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:53,511
Oh, my. Gherkins and...

122
00:07:54,023 --> 00:07:56,184
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

123
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:01,221
We don't entertain much.

124
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:05,797
Missy. Do you enjoy pajamas?

125
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:09,165
- I guess.
- Yeah, we Indians invented them.

126
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:11,536
You're welcome.

127
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,511
Yeah, well,
my people invented circumcision.

128
00:08:20,016 --> 00:08:21,506
You're welcome.

129
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,780
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you wanna come?

130
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:28,219
God, yes. Thanks.

131
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,222
You're welcome.

132
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,392
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy.

133
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,722
Bye, Missy, see you.

134
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:37,093
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Yeah, no, bye, Penny.

135
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,603
- You two have to back off.
- Why should I back off? You back off.

136
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,968
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

137
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,575
- So what? You've got Penny.
- How do I have Penny?

138
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,802
In what universe do I have Penny?

139
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:53,481
- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no.

140
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,585
Excuse me, can I interject something?

141
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,686
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

142
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,024
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

143
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,861
Don't worry,
I was going to order you cheese-less.

144
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:11,363
- Thank you.
It's okay.

145
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:14,503
Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

146
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,331
I'm a fancy
Indian man. We invented pajamas.

147
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,806
Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.

148
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,613
Sheldon.

149
00:09:33,556 --> 00:09:36,855
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

150
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,459
Hm.

151
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:44,032
She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,464
It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...

153
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:51,573
...heavier women were the standard for
beauty because girth suggested affluence.

154
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:54,069
- That's fascinating...
- I didn't say fascinating.

155
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:55,710
I said it was noteworthy.

156
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,241
All right. Noted.

157
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:03,044
But my point
is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz...

158
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:07,087
They're hitting on your sister.
Ugh. It's...

159
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,484
Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want
to criticize your rhetorical style...

160
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:15,062
...but we'd be further along
in this conversation...

161
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:17,222
...if you'd begun with that thought.

162
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,965
That's great, but...

163
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,229
We took quite a detour
from what I understand to be your thesis.

164
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:23,963
Whatever.

165
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:27,807
- You have to do something about it.
- Why?

166
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:29,740
Because she's your sister.

167
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:32,641
I don't understand.

168
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:35,215
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months.

169
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,615
But since then, we've pretty much gone
our own separate ways.

170
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,790
Okay, consider this.

171
00:10:41,957 --> 00:10:45,518
With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

172
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,994
...to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.

173
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,098
I hadn't considered that.

174
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:55,098
We do share DNA.

175
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:57,364
So there is the possibility,
however remote...

176
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,941
...that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...

177
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,874
...as remarkable as myself.

178
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:09,040
Exactly. And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity...

179
00:11:09,218 --> 00:11:13,120
...to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

180
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:18,787
You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...

181
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,259
...they'll have to go through me.

182
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,733
I am Shiva, the destroyer.
I will have the woman.

183
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:39,580
I'm warning you.
I was judo champion at math camp.

184
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,008
All right.
That's enough juvenile squabbling.

185
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:44,243
You stop it. You stop it, I say.

186
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,647
I'm gonna settle this right now.

187
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,257
Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

188
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:52,018
Who are you to decide that?

189
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,890
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

190
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,658
- You're out too, by the way.
- Say what?

191
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,165
Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...

192
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:03,931
...didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an Eskimo Pie.

193
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:13,079
- What are you so happy about?
- I'm not happy.

194
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,241
It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.

195
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,857
Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...

196
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,396
...we have to face the fact
that none of you are suitable for my sister.

197
00:12:30,566 --> 00:12:34,127
Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?

198
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:37,505
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,673
Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

200
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,004
- How so?
- Everybody knows genetic diversity...

201
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,010
...produces the strongest offspring.

202
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,776
Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

203
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,945
In principle, you have a point.

204
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:57,081
But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...

205
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,820
...to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?

206
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,727
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

207
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:11,265
Is it because I'm Jewish?

208
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,932
Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.

209
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:23,213
This has nothing to do with religion.

210
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,853
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...

211
00:13:26,021 --> 00:13:28,046
...who still lives with his mother.

212
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:32,289
- Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.
- Am I?

213
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,528
Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

214
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,691
Oh, really?

215
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,263
Oops.

216
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,309
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.

217
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:52,777
Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?

218
00:13:52,948 --> 00:13:55,940
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

219
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,181
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

220
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,260
Okay.

221
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,024
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...

222
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:15,098
...but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

223
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,432
Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...

224
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:21,167
...but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

225
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:24,073
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

226
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:27,647
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...

227
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:30,683
...an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

228
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,116
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?

229
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,383
That would be you.

230
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,225
But residing within you
is the potential for another me.

231
00:14:41,397 --> 00:14:44,594
Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.

232
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,259
A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

233
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,604
- Sheldon 2.0?
- Exactly.

234
00:14:51,774 --> 00:14:55,505
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

235
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:59,239
If you're not attracted, then the likelihood
of conception will be reduced.

236
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,883
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

237
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:05,316
Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.

238
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,423
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

239
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:15,522
Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...

240
00:15:15,698 --> 00:15:19,657
...as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.

241
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:22,867
I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.

242
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:27,099
A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.

243
00:15:27,276 --> 00:15:29,335
The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...

244
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,537
...leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

245
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,946
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

246
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,781
I thought it ended at cuckoo.

247
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,454
Now, you listen to me.

248
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:46,857
If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.

249
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,696
Bring it on.

250
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,799
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...

251
00:15:51,967 --> 00:15:56,734
...and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?

252
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:02,539
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

253
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,238
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

254
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:09,350
I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...

255
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:12,009
...have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

256
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:13,484
That way, everybody wins.

257
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:26,799
Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

258
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:31,064
- Look, we have to settle this.
- I agree.

259
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,869
Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

260
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:39,344
She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

261
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:42,245
Oh, and then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

262
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:45,511
Oh, you poor deluded bastard.

263
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,883
- Don't start with me, dude.
- You wanna go again?

264
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:50,025
- Sit down.
- Okay.

265
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:53,555
If we're gonna fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

266
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:55,219
The honorable way.

267
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,625
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

268
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,562
Take that.

269
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,429
You want some more?

270
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,671
And he's down.

271
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,435
<i>One, two, three, four...</i>

272
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,170
- Come on, come on! Get up.
- Stay down, bitch.

273
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:14,907
<i>Seven, eight, nine, 10.</i>

274
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,051
Yeah! Natural selection at work.

275
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:21,485
I weep for humanity.

276
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:24,990
Excuse me
while I go tell Missy the good news.

277
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,034
- Hey.
- Hi, Penny, how's it going?

278
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,898
That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

279
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,732
- Pretty much, why?
- Just catching up.

280
00:17:37,906 --> 00:17:40,272
By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

281
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,603
Of course.

282
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,874
Hi, Leonard, what's up?

283
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:50,109
Well, since you're leaving, I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

284
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,378
That's so sweet. But no, thanks.

285
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,485
Oh.

286
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,217
- Do you have other plans or...?
- No.

287
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,264
All right.

288
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:08,694
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks, I'll see you.

289
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:18,243
Um, here's something
we didn't anticipate.

290
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:28,451
- What do you want, Howard?
- I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

291
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:30,919
I've come to call on Missy.

292
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,828
Missy.

293
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,633
- Hi, Howard.
- The Amazing Howard.

294
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:42,096
- Do you like magic?
- Not really, no.

295
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,373
Then you are in for a treat.

296
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:50,573
Behold, an ordinary cane.

297
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,884
Ta-da.

298
00:18:58,487 --> 00:18:59,954
No.

299
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:02,650
Okay.

300
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:21,540
Missy.

301
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:25,408
Thank you, I apprec...

302
00:19:26,815 --> 00:19:28,806
Apprec...

303
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,511
Appre...

304
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:32,813
Uh-oh.

305
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:35,650
Oh, honey,
is your medication wearing off?

306
00:19:39,194 --> 00:19:43,255
Well, hi, cutie pie.
I was hoping you'd show up.

307
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,424
We had a dog
who made a noise like that.

308
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,586
Had to put him down.

309
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,395
Any news you want me
to pass along to Mom?

310
00:20:22,571 --> 00:20:25,904
Well, she might be interested to know
that I've refocused my research...

311
00:20:26,074 --> 00:20:29,134
...from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

312
00:20:30,178 --> 00:20:32,442
Yeah, I'll just tell her you said, "Hey. "

313
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:36,717
Okay. Well, it was pleasant seeing you.

314
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:40,150
Other than that business
with my testicles.

315
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,823
Come on, Shelly.

316
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,190
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

317
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:52,628
- Really?
- Yep.

318
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:56,794
I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

319
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,934
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

320
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,203
- Well, yeah.
- I'm a theoretical physicist.

321
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:08,076
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

322
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,584
- Goodbye, Shelly.
- My God.

323
00:21:12,754 --> 00:21:16,781
Why don't you just tell them that
I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge?

324
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,357
A rocket scientist, how humiliating.
