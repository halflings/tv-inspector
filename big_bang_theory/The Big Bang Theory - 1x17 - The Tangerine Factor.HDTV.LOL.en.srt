1
00:00:01,993 --> 00:00:04,146
<i>Wo de zing shi</i> Sheldon.

2
00:00:04,564 --> 00:00:05,550
Non, c'est...

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:07,814
<i>Wo de ming zi shi</i> Sheldon.

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,765
<i>Wo de ming zi shi</i> Sheldon.

5
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:14,279
What's this?

6
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,448
That's what you did.

7
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:21,316
I assumed, as in a number of languages,
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

8
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:23,485
Well, it's not.

9
00:00:24,112 --> 00:00:27,146
How am I supposed to know that?
As the teacher, it's your obligation

10
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:30,325
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies
from the subject matter.

11
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:33,284
You know, I'm really glad
you decided to learn Mandarin.

12
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,896
- Why?
- Once you're fluent,

13
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,749
you'll have a billion more people
to annoy instead of me.

14
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,045
<i>Mei du lui zi.</i>

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,617
You just called Leonard
a syphilitic donkey.

16
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:48,551
My apologies,

17
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,628
I'm only as good as my teacher.

18
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:53,448
Why are you learning Chinese?

19
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,847
I believe the Szechuan Palace
has been passing off

20
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:59,390
orange chicken as tangerine chicken
and I intend to confront them.

21
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:02,551
If I were you, I'd be more concerned

22
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,604
about what they are passing off
as chicken.

23
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,320
- I need to use your window.
- Sure, go ahead.

24
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:14,945
Hey, jerk face, you forgot your iPod!

25
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:19,660
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,294
That stupid self-centered bastar
wrote about our sex life in his blog.

27
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:28,571
Drop dead,
you stupid self-centered bastard!

28
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,982
Thank you.

29
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,017
Okay, where were we?

30
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:39,831
Not now, I have a blog to find.

31
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:44,983
Episode 117: The Tangerine Factor

32
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,901
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: sub-way.fr | italiansubs.net

33
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,023
Penny, are you okay?

34
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:15,096
I'm fine, Leonard. Just go away!

35
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:19,635
I understand that breaking up
with someone can be very painful...

36
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,888
- Go away!
- Okay, feel better! Bye!

37
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,319
She doesn't want to talk.

38
00:02:30,893 --> 00:02:33,618
Not surprising.
Penny's emotional response is originated

39
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,451
in the primitive portion of the brain,
known as the amygdala.

40
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:39,486
While speech is centered in the much
more recently developed neo-cortex.

41
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:41,539
The former can easily
overpower the latter,

42
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:44,793
giving scientific credence to the notion
of being "rendered speechless."

43
00:02:50,973 --> 00:02:53,051
Or maybe she just doesn't want to talk.

44
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:57,555
Look, I found an iPod!

45
00:03:01,528 --> 00:03:04,354
It's smashed beyond repair.
What are you gonna do with it?

46
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:07,667
What else?
Sell it on eBay as "slightly used."

47
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,837
It was Penny's boyfriend's,
they broke up.

48
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:14,286
Apparently, he posted intimate details
of their physical relationship

49
00:03:14,406 --> 00:03:17,650
on his blog
which I cannot find anywhere.

50
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:21,856
I'm gonna go back
and try talking to her again.

51
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,685
Good idea, sit with her.

52
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:25,166
Hold her, comfort her.

53
00:03:25,327 --> 00:03:26,974
And if the moment feels right,

54
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,948
see if you can cop a feel.

55
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:33,116
I'm not going to do that, Howard.

56
00:03:33,236 --> 00:03:36,943
I'm not aware of a new social convention
that requires you to intervene at all.

57
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:38,888
What about damsel in distress?

58
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:42,246
Twelfth century code of chivalry?
Not exactly current.

59
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:45,569
You'd also have to be knighted
for that to apply.

60
00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:49,177
I don't care.
She's upset, I'm going over there.

61
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:52,187
Remember to sit on your hands a bit,
so they're warm.

62
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:56,865
I'm her friend. I'm not going
to take advantage of her vulnerability.

63
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,962
So you're saying,
if in the depths of despair,

64
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,537
she throws herself at you
and demands you take her,

65
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:05,123
right there, right now,
you'll just walk away?

66
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:08,104
I said I'm her friend,
not her gay friend.

67
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,701
Listen, I know you said
you didn't want to talk...

68
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,260
- I don't.
- Sorry.

69
00:04:17,994 --> 00:04:20,027
- Wait!
- Wait? Did you say "wait"?

70
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:23,690
Tell me the truth.

71
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,103
Am I just an idiot
who picks giant losers?

72
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:32,483
So I pick good guys
but turn them into losers.

73
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:34,110
- Of course not.
- Well,

74
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,821
it's gotta be one or the other.
Which is it?

75
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:45,038
I'm sorry, what were the choices again?

76
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:47,332
I really thought Mike was different.

77
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:48,750
I thought he was...

78
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:50,619
sensitive and smart,

79
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,873
I mean, not <i>you</i> smart,
normal non-freaky smart.

80
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,632
Yeah, no, sure.

81
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:58,161
And then he just goes
and has to humiliate me

82
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,721
by writing about me on his blog
so the entire world can read it.

83
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:04,361
I tell you, it's not all
that easy to find.

84
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:07,846
Really? My friends at work found it,
my sister found it.

85
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:09,888
Judging by my email,
a number of prisoners

86
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:12,522
at the Michigan State
Penitentiary found it.

87
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:14,943
What exactly did this guy write?

88
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:18,612
Not that I need to know the details
of your sex life. I just thought...

89
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:20,766
Never mind.

90
00:05:21,643 --> 00:05:22,959
No, you know what?

91
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:26,278
You might as well read it.
Everybody else has. Go ahead.

92
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,168
Oh, God, I just feel
so betrayed and embarrassed!

93
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,056
I just want to crawl
into a hole and die!

94
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,217
Okay. Well, you know,
this isn't that bad.

95
00:05:39,751 --> 00:05:41,177
It just paints the picture

96
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:43,149
of a very affectionate woman,

97
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:45,719
who's open to expressing her affection

98
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:48,351
in non-traditional locales.

99
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:49,952
Oh, God!

100
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:52,445
Elevators, parks,

101
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,959
movie theaters.

102
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,009
Out of curiosity,

103
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,238
is this "subway"
the transportation system

104
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,281
or Subway the sandwich shop?

105
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:04,672
Sandwich shop.

106
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:08,705
Doesn't that violate the health code?

107
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,249
No, at the sub shop
we were only making out.

108
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,378
But my point is that

109
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,964
you have absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed.

110
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,082
Really?
Do you think I overreacted?

111
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:24,368
- Maybe a little.
- Because I do that. I do overreact.

112
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:26,384
Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.

113
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,767
That would be under-reacting.

114
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:33,824
He did break the implied
confidentiality of the bedroom.

115
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:37,942
And in your case, the elevator,
parks and fast food franchise.

116
00:06:39,318 --> 00:06:41,904
You're right.
I should just say "I am done with him."

117
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,865
Yes, you should.
Go ahead, say it.

118
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,118
But I never gave the man
a chance to explain.

119
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:50,288
What is there to explain?
It's all right here.

120
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,924
The betrayal!

121
00:06:52,617 --> 00:06:54,938
No, you were right
the first time.

122
00:06:55,058 --> 00:06:58,556
This is a man who loves me,
but in his own stupid way,

123
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:01,499
which is trying to show people
how he feels.

124
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm pretty sure I never said that.

125
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,806
You did better than that.
You helped me see it on my own.

126
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,349
Oh, good for me.

127
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,470
Where are you going?

128
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,105
I'm going over to Mike's.
Leonard, thank you so much.

129
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:17,383
Oh, sure.

130
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,042
Maybe I <i>am</i> her gay friend.

131
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,569
I'm going to need
another Mandarin lesson.

132
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:38,481
I obviously didn't make
my point with those people.

133
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,864
For God's sake,

134
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:43,965
if you don't like the tangerine chicken,
don't order the tangerine chicken.

135
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,345
I like tangerine chicken,
I'm just not getting tangerine chicken.

136
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:51,516
- Can we please change the subject?
- Sure.

137
00:07:51,936 --> 00:07:55,520
Tell us again how you screwed up and got
Penny back together with her boyfriend.

138
00:07:57,216 --> 00:07:58,708
Just roll the dice.

139
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:06,489
"Enslaved by warlocks. Stay here
until you roll two, four or six."

140
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,824
She was mad at him!

141
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,953
She was done with him! The relationship
was broken beyond repair,

142
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:14,449
and I walked over there,
and I fixed it.

143
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:18,668
Boy, that story gets better
every time you hear it.

144
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,842
Actually, I thought the first
two renditions were far more compelling.

145
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:25,475
Previously, I felt sympathy
for the Leonard character,

146
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:28,391
now I just find him
to be whiny and annoying.

147
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:32,014
Eat your tangerine chicken.

148
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:35,059
I'd love to, but I don't
have tangerine chicken.

149
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,745
Thank you so much
for your stupid advice!

150
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:47,889
Incredible.

151
00:08:48,268 --> 00:08:50,905
You managed to screw up the screw-up.

152
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,207
I'm back.

153
00:08:58,965 --> 00:09:00,646
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

154
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,420
It's not your fault.

155
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,295
What happened?

156
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:07,508
I went over to Mike's
to make up with him.

157
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,261
Yeah. No, I know that part.

158
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:12,138
But he had already moved on.

159
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:14,056
Already? That was quick.

160
00:09:14,217 --> 00:09:18,178
That's what I said to the woman
who had her legs around his neck.

161
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:25,603
- Penny, I am so sorry.
- How could he do that?!

162
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,313
You know, you did
throw an 80-gig iPod...

163
00:09:29,523 --> 00:09:31,407
Yeah, no, how could he do that?

164
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,317
I swear to God I am done
with guys like that.

165
00:09:35,437 --> 00:09:39,248
You know, macho with the perfect body
and the hair and the money.

166
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:41,431
Yeah, that must get old quick.

167
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,586
You know, just once

168
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:46,187
I would like to go out with someone

169
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:48,207
who is nice and honest

170
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:50,468
and who actually cares about me.

171
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:53,693
What about me?

172
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,917
What about you what?

173
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,929
What about if you went out with me?

174
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:05,698
Are you asking me out?

175
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,588
Yes, I am...

176
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:10,382
asking you out.

177
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,804
I was just going off
your comment about the nice guy.

178
00:10:16,924 --> 00:10:18,478
- No, I got that.
- And honest.

179
00:10:18,598 --> 00:10:20,623
- Totally.
- It's not a big deal.

180
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,153
Yes what?

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,825
Yes, I will go out with you.

182
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:31,801
Really?

183
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,391
Why not? I mean...
What do I have to lose?

184
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,306
That's the spirit.

185
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,909
Show me your citrus peels.

186
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:54,179
<i>Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.</i>

187
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,143
Show me your citrus peels.

188
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:01,232
<i>Gay wo kan ni de jud zi pee.</i>

189
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:02,707
Sheldon?

190
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,169
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:09,880
Look, do you have a second?

192
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,463
A second what, pair of underwear?

193
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:16,387
I was just wondering if I could
talk to you. It's about Leonard.

194
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,679
Why me?

195
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,724
Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?

196
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,712
Well, Raj can't talk to me
unless he's drunk,

197
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,251
and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.

198
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:28,750
Yes, I suppose he is.

199
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,902
All I'm saying is,
you know Leonard the best.

200
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:34,279
Not necessarily.

201
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,404
I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

202
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:40,660
Just the other day I discovered
he not only has a loofah,

203
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,012
he hides it.

204
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,465
Why do you suppose a man would
be ashamed of having a loofah?

205
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,889
I, myself, prefer to have my excess
epithelial cells slough off naturally,

206
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,312
but I don't condemn those who seek
to accelerate the process.

207
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,500
And until recently,

208
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,461
I had no idea that
despite his lactose intolerance,

209
00:11:57,581 --> 00:12:00,121
he can tolerate small amounts
of non-fat ice cream

210
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,583
without producing a noxious
gas that I maintain,

211
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,061
in the right concentration,
could be weaponized.

212
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:09,148
Leonard might come home.
Can we talk in my apartment?

213
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,006
We're not done?

214
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:13,778
No.

215
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:17,073
Why not? We're already through
the looking glass anyway.

216
00:12:21,947 --> 00:12:23,542
Okay, so here's the thing...

217
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:27,001
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

218
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:30,985
He didn't actually say anything,
but when he came back to the apartment

219
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:34,687
he was doing a dance that brought
to mind the happy hippos in <i>Fantasia</i>.

220
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,834
That's nice.

221
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,198
Anyhow, the thing I wanted
to talk to you about

222
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:43,182
is, since Leonard and I
have become friends... I was just...

223
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,429
Wanna sit down?

224
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:48,029
I wish it were that simple.

225
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:53,567
I don't spend much time here, and so
I've never really chosena place to sit.

226
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:55,198
Well, choose.

227
00:12:55,813 --> 00:12:58,054
There are a number of options and...

228
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:01,741
I'm really not familiar enough
with the cushion densities,

229
00:13:01,861 --> 00:13:03,954
air flow patterns
and dispersion of unlight

230
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,616
to make an informed choice.

231
00:13:06,156 --> 00:13:08,733
Why don't you just pick one at random
and if you don't like it

232
00:13:08,853 --> 00:13:11,946
- you can sit somewhere else next time.
- No. That's crazy.

233
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:16,308
You go ahead and talk
while I figure it out.

234
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,356
Here's the thing.

235
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:24,306
So I've known for a while now
that Leonard has had

236
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:27,467
- a little crush on me...
- A little crush?

237
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,707
I suppose so... in the same way Menelaus
had a "little crush" on Helen of Troy.

238
00:13:34,657 --> 00:13:36,579
I don't really know who they are...

239
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,196
- Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon.
- I don't care.

240
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,489
The point is,

241
00:13:41,867 --> 00:13:44,535
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

242
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,934
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

243
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:51,955
Would you be open to rotating
the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

244
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:53,627
No. What I'm saying is

245
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,589
Leonard might be
different in a good way.

246
00:13:57,145 --> 00:14:00,092
Obviously, my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

247
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:02,396
Your last one worked
out well for Koothrappali.

248
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:03,930
He got a free iPod.

249
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:07,562
Glare.

250
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,006
On the other hand,
if things don't go well with Leonard,

251
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,313
I risk losing a really good friend.

252
00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:15,395
I'm guessing he's not looking
for a fling.

253
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,906
He's the kind of guy that gets
into a relationship for...

254
00:14:18,026 --> 00:14:20,654
- like you would say, light years.
- I would not say that.

255
00:14:21,816 --> 00:14:25,044
No one would say that. A light year
is a unit of distance not time.

256
00:14:25,773 --> 00:14:27,703
Thank you for the clarification.

257
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:35,697
Draft.

258
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:40,097
People hear the word "year"
and they think duration.

259
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:43,899
"Foot-pound" has the same problem,
that's a unit of work, not of weight.

260
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,262
Right. Thanks.

261
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,520
- It's a common mistake.
- Not the first one I've made today.

262
00:14:51,434 --> 00:14:53,322
I think this will be my seat.

263
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:57,382
Do you have anything to say
that has anything to do with

264
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,893
what I'm talking about?

265
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,293
Well, let's see...

266
00:15:01,982 --> 00:15:04,073
We might consider Schrodinger's cat.

267
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,284
Schrodinger?
Is that the woman in 2A?

268
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:08,815
That's Mrs. Grossinger.

269
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,239
She doesn't have a cat,
she has a Mexican hairless.

270
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,260
- Annoying little animal.
- Sheldon.

271
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:16,717
Sorry, you diverted me.

272
00:15:16,837 --> 00:15:20,144
Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger,

273
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:23,569
in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics,

274
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,175
he proposed an experiment

275
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:28,957
where a cat is placed in a box
with a sealed vial of poison

276
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,850
that will break open at a random time.

277
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,518
Now, since no one knows

278
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,564
when or if the poison has been released,
until the box is opened,

279
00:15:36,684 --> 00:15:40,145
the cat can be thought of
as both alive and dead.

280
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,286
Sorry. I don't get the point.

281
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,877
Of course you don't get it.
I haven't made it yet.

282
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:54,129
You'd have to be psychic to get it,
and there's no such thing as "psychic."

283
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:55,861
Sheldon, what's the point?!

284
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:57,672
Just like Schrodinger's cat,

285
00:15:57,803 --> 00:16:00,348
your potential relationship
with Leonard right now

286
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,464
can be thought of as both good and bad.

287
00:16:02,772 --> 00:16:06,126
It is only by opening the box
that you'll find out which it is.

288
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:10,264
Okay, so you're saying I should
go out with Leonard.

289
00:16:13,742 --> 00:16:17,021
Let me start again.
In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger...

290
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,233
Two seats right there.

291
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,159
- Sheldon, I think I've made a mistake.
- I can see that.

292
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,092
Unless you're planning on running
a marathon, choosing both stuffing

293
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,663
and mashed potatoes
is a starch-filled redundancy.

294
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,714
No, it's about Penny.

295
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:46,078
A mistake involving Penny.

296
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:48,836
You'll have to narrow it down.

297
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,096
I don't think
I can go out with her tonight.

298
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:53,383
Then don't.

299
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:56,101
Other people would say "Why not?"

300
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,296
Other people might be interested.

301
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,469
- I'm going to talk anyway.
- I assumed you would.

302
00:17:03,964 --> 00:17:06,176
Now that I'm actually about
to go out with Penny,

303
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,447
I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.

304
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,584
Then your meal choice is appropriate.

305
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:13,425
Starch absorbs fluid
which reduces the amount of vomit

306
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,454
available for violent expulsion.

307
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:16,655
Right.

308
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,791
You also made a common
grammatical mistake.

309
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,085
You said "nauseous,"
when you meant "nauseated."

310
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,492
But go on.

311
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,163
Sheldon, this date is probably
my one chance with Penny.

312
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:28,918
What happens if I blow it?

313
00:17:29,495 --> 00:17:31,379
Well, if we accept your premise

314
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,881
and also accept the highly
improbable assumption

315
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:36,554
that Penny is the only woman
in the world for you,

316
00:17:36,674 --> 00:17:39,274
then we can logically conclude
that the result of blowing it

317
00:17:39,394 --> 00:17:42,755
would be that you end up a lonely,
bitter old man with no progeny.

318
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,319
The image of any number
of evil lighthouse keepers

319
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,667
from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind.

320
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:50,117
You're not helping.

321
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:51,902
What response on my part

322
00:17:52,022 --> 00:17:54,283
would bring this conversation
to a speedy conclusion?

323
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,852
Tell me whether or not
to go through with the date.

324
00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:58,622
Schrodinger's cat.

325
00:17:59,664 --> 00:18:01,279
That's brilliant.

326
00:18:02,843 --> 00:18:04,407
You sound surprised.

327
00:18:28,603 --> 00:18:30,471
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

328
00:18:32,707 --> 00:18:33,946
You look very nice.

329
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,325
Thank you. So do you.

330
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,665
I made an 8:00 reservation.

331
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,816
Okay, yeah, great. Listen...

332
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,211
Maybe we should talk first.

333
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:54,505
But before you say anything, have you
ever heard of Schrodinger's cat?

334
00:18:57,107 --> 00:19:00,252
Actually, I've heard far too much
about Schrodinger's cat.

335
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:02,883
Good.

336
00:19:09,465 --> 00:19:11,815
All right, the cat's alive.
Let's go to dinner.

337
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:28,710
Crazy man. Call the police!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
