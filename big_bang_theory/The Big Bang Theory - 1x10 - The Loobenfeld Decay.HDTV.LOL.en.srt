1
00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:05,311
No, see, the liquid metal Terminators
were created in the future by Skynet,

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,094
and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson,
but that future no longer exists

3
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:11,564
due to Dyson's death
in <i>Terminator 2</i>.

4
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:13,991
Then riddle me this:

5
00:00:14,495 --> 00:00:16,190
Assuming all the good Terminators

6
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,897
were originally evil
Terminators created by Skynet

7
00:00:19,057 --> 00:00:21,150
but then reprogrammed by
the future John Connor,

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,168
why would Skynet,
an artificial computer intelligence,

9
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:27,683
bother to create a petite, hot,
17-year-old killer robot?

10
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,601
Skynet is kinky?
I don't know...

11
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,443
Artificial intelligences
do not have teen fetishes.

12
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,457
Wait! They use it to...

13
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:40,293
Too late. I win.

14
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,470
What the hell is that?

15
00:00:58,694 --> 00:01:01,277
I don't know,
but if cats could sing...

16
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,636
they'd hate it, too.

17
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:14,640
Hey, guys!

18
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,247
- Hi! Where you going?
- What?

19
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:20,170
We just had to mail
some letters...

20
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,782
and...

21
00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:24,024
throw away some chicken.

22
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:43,022
You'll never guess
what just happened.

23
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:44,096
I give up.

24
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:46,636
I don't guess.
As a scientist, I reach conclusions

25
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,861
based on observation
and experimentation.

26
00:01:49,814 --> 00:01:52,597
Although as I'm saying this, it occurs
to me you may have been employing

27
00:01:52,717 --> 00:01:55,362
a rhetorical device
rendering my response moot.

28
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:59,433
- What was that?
- Believe it or not, personal growth.

29
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:00,790
What happened?

30
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,326
Remember when I auditioned
for that workshop production of <i>Rent</i>,

31
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,189
but I didn't get it
and I didn't know why.

32
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:07,261
I have a conclusion
based on an observation.

33
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,431
No, you don't.
No, he doesn't.

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,424
The girl they picked to play Mimi
dropped out,

35
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:14,011
and they asked me to replace her.

36
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,014
Congratulations.
What a lucky break.

37
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,117
It's not a big deal,
just a one-night showcase,

38
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:21,061
but they invite a lot of casting people.
So, you never know.

39
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,259
- I think I know.
- No, you don't.

40
00:02:24,225 --> 00:02:25,263
He doesn't.

41
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,357
It's this Friday at 8:00.
You want to come?

42
00:02:30,394 --> 00:02:31,542
Because...

43
00:02:32,647 --> 00:02:36,860
Friday we are attending a symposium
on molecular positronium.

44
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,913
I think that's a week from Tuesday,
at 6:00.

45
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,287
No, it's this Friday.

46
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,651
At 8:00.

47
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,626
Too bad.
I gotta get to rehearsal.

48
00:02:44,977 --> 00:02:46,727
- See you guys.
- See ya.

49
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,258
You just lied to Penny.

50
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,968
- Yes, I did.
- And you did it

51
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,501
so casually-- no rapid breathing,
no increase in perspiration...

52
00:02:58,883 --> 00:02:59,474
So?

53
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,262
So, lack of a physiological
response while lying

54
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,932
is characteristic
of a violent sociopath.

55
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,565
Sheldon, are you worried
about your safety?

56
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,706
No, I imagine if you
were going to kill me,

57
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,819
you'd have done it
a long time ago.

58
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,528
That's very true.

59
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,685
Episode 110
The Loobenfeld Decay

60
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:39,319
Transcript: swsub.com
Synchro: Sixe, Jesslataree

61
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:04,991
What?

62
00:04:07,564 --> 00:04:09,209
I need to speak to you.

63
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:12,103
- It's 2:00 in the morning!
- It's important.

64
00:04:12,223 --> 00:04:13,948
I highly doubt that.

65
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:15,550
Go away.

66
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,437
Are you still out there?

67
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,604
What?

68
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,816
You're right;
it can wait until morning.

69
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:36,131
- What, what?
- Never mind.

70
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,740
I clearly woke you up
in the middle of a REM cycle.

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,533
You're in no state of mind to talk.

72
00:04:40,876 --> 00:04:42,079
What is it?

73
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:46,998
I'm uncomfortable having been
included in your lie to Penny.

74
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:49,265
What was I supposed to say?

75
00:04:49,385 --> 00:04:52,629
- You could have told her the truth.
- That would have hurt her feelings.

76
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,148
Is that a relevant factor?

77
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,801
Then I suppose
you could've agreed to go.

78
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:02,123
And what would I have said afterwards?

79
00:05:02,243 --> 00:05:04,182
I would suggest something
to the effect of:

80
00:05:04,342 --> 00:05:06,555
singing is
neither an appropriate vocation

81
00:05:06,675 --> 00:05:09,076
nor avocation for you,
and if you disagree,

82
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,569
I'd recommend you have a CAT scan
to look for a tumor

83
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,025
pressing on the cognitive
processing centers of your brain.

84
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:18,270
I couldn't say that.
I would have to say,

85
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,699
"You were terrific and I can't wait
to hear you sing again."

86
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:23,247
Why?

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,829
That's the social protocol.
It's what you do when you have a friend

88
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,792
who's proud of something
they really suck at.

89
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,211
I was not aware of that.

90
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:35,004
Well, now you are.

91
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:36,714
All right. Leonard?

92
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,921
When we played chess earlier,
you were terrific,

93
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,387
and I can't wait to play you again.
Good night.

94
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,609
This would be so much easier
if I were a violent sociopath.

95
00:05:59,094 --> 00:05:59,988
What?

96
00:06:00,148 --> 00:06:01,721
I was analyzing our lie,

97
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,742
and I believe we're in danger
of Penny seeing through the ruse.

98
00:06:05,171 --> 00:06:06,169
How?

99
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,250
Simple:
If she were to log onto

100
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,626
www.socalphysixsgroup.org
/activities/other,

101
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,886
click on "Upcoming Events,"
scroll down to "Seminars,"

102
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,464
download the PDF schedule,

103
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,923
and look for the seminar
on molecular positronium,

104
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:22,334
bippity, boppity, boo--
our pants are metaphorically on fire.

105
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:30,783
Well, sir, my trousers
will not be igniting today.

106
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:39,652
Good morning.

107
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:41,738
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

108
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:42,838
Of course I do.

109
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:46,395
My watch is linked to the atomic clock
in Boulder, Colorado.

110
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:48,327
It's accurate
to one-tenth of a second.

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,100
But as I'm saying this, it occurs to me

112
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,249
that, once again, your question
may have been rhetorical.

1
00:06:54,576 --> 00:06:55,712
What do you want?

2
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,679
Remember how Leonard told you
we couldn't come to your performance

3
00:06:58,863 --> 00:07:01,958
because we were attending a symposium
on molecular positronium?

4
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,783
I remember "symposium."

5
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:09,465
Yes.
Well... he lied.

6
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,693
Wait.
What?

7
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:14,981
He lied, and I'm feeling
very uncomfortable about it.

8
00:07:15,398 --> 00:07:17,390
Well, imagine how I'm feeling.

9
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
Hungry?

10
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:22,695
Tired?

11
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,930
I'm sorry,
this really isn't my strong suit.

12
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:30,087
You told her I lied?
Why would you tell her I lied?

13
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,971
To help you.

14
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,508
I'm sorry,
I'm not seeing the help.

15
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:38,006
She was going to see through
your lie eventually,

16
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,348
so I told her that you
were lying to protect me.

17
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:43,762
I'm getting a bad feeling.

18
00:07:44,635 --> 00:07:45,635
Hunger?

19
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:48,212
Indigestion?

20
00:07:48,472 --> 00:07:50,450
I'm sorry, I'm really
not very good at this.

21
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,700
Anyway, Penny now believes that,
on Friday night,

22
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,655
we're going to participate in my cousin
Leopold's drug intervention.

23
00:07:59,461 --> 00:08:00,817
Your cousin Leopold.

24
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,571
Who most people call Leo,
but he also answers to Lee.

25
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:06,386
- Remember that. It's important.
- What's important?

26
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:07,848
Details, Leonard--

27
00:08:08,008 --> 00:08:11,194
the success or failure of our deceitful
enterprise turns on details.

28
00:08:12,016 --> 00:08:13,738
- Do you have a cousin Leopold?
- No.

29
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,390
I made him up.

30
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,992
I think you'd call him Lee.

31
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:21,632
I don't get it.
I already told her a lie.

32
00:08:21,807 --> 00:08:24,039
Why replace it with a different lie?

33
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,697
First of all, your lie
was laughably transparent,

34
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:29,087
where mine is exquisitely convoluted.

35
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,758
While you were sleeping,
I was weaving an un-unravelable web.

36
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,197
Un-unravelable?

37
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:37,409
Yes.

38
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:40,632
If she Googles "Leopold Houston,"
she'll find a Facebook page,

39
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,193
an online blog depicting
his descent into drug use

40
00:08:43,353 --> 00:08:46,221
and a desperate yet hopeful
listing on eHarmony.com.

41
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:51,706
Okay, why would I go
to a drug intervention for your cousin?

42
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:54,638
Because it's in Long Beach,
and I don't drive.

43
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:59,708
- We're going to Long Beach?
- Of course not. There's no cousin Leo.

44
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,786
There's no intervention.
Focus, Leonard.

45
00:09:02,046 --> 00:09:03,018
Aw, come on.

46
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:07,125
We just leave the house
on Friday night and we return

47
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:09,270
in the wee hours,
emotionally wrung out,

48
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,755
from the work of convincing Leo
to go back into rehab.

49
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:14,090
- He goes back into rehab?
- Yes, but,

50
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,723
he can relapse if Penny

51
00:09:15,976 --> 00:09:18,432
ever invites us
to hear her sing again.

52
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,981
You still told her I lied.

53
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:25,598
For a noble purpose--
to spare me the social embarrassment

54
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:30,064
of having a drug-addled first cousin--
which I'm assuming is embarrassing, yes?

55
00:09:31,816 --> 00:09:33,725
How am I supposed
to remember all of this?

56
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,597
That's the best part.
You don't have to.

57
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,757
I told Penny
that you would be embarrassed

58
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:39,903
if you knew that she found out
that you had lied,

59
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:43,642
so she's agreed to operate as if
the original lie is still in force.

60
00:09:46,446 --> 00:09:48,551
So she's expecting me

61
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,222
to lie about going
to a symposium in Pasadena,

62
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:52,920
when, in actuality,

63
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,424
we're pretending to go to a drug
intervention in Long Beach.

64
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:58,426
Un-unravelable.

65
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,586
Look at you,
all ready for your showcase.

66
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,285
- You look great.
- Thanks.

67
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:09,436
I just wanted to come by,
wish you guys luck

68
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,522
with your... symposium.

69
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:15,435
Thank you.

70
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:18,437
I got to tell you, a lot of friends
would let their friend go alone,

71
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:21,053
but that's not who you are.
You are the kind of guy

72
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,247
who stands by a friend when...

73
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,906
Wen he has a symposium to go to.

74
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:31,570
I don't know what to say.

75
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,003
It's okay, Leonard.

76
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:35,813
Okay, all right, good.

77
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,426
Oh, boy, group hug.

78
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,511
So, what's up?

79
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,649
Well, Penny is on her way to perform

80
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,807
in a one-night
showcase production of Rent,

81
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:48,893
which we are unable to attend,

82
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:52,017
because we're going to a symposium
on molecular positronium

83
00:10:52,177 --> 00:10:54,245
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

84
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:58,402
Wait a minute. Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

85
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,923
- Howard, I'm sorr...
- No, no, you're quark-blocking us.

86
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,256
I don't know what to say.

87
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:11,637
It's okay.
It's your Millennium Falcon.

88
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,343
You and Chewbacca
do whatever you want to do.

89
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,372
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

90
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:20,740
Howard, wait.

91
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,672
Sheldon,
I think we should tell them.

92
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:28,419
Okay, sure.
I don't see a problem with that.

93
00:11:29,718 --> 00:11:30,935
There's no symposium.

94
00:11:31,894 --> 00:11:34,139
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right, Leonard?

95
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:38,253
I don't know what to say!

96
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,156
It's okay; I do.

97
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:42,655
Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

98
00:11:43,033 --> 00:11:45,092
He made up the whole story
about the symposium

99
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:47,623
with Dr. Farman...
farmian...

100
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:48,783
Good for you.

101
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:52,281
...he didn't want
Sheldon to be embarrassed.

102
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:54,466
And there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

103
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,737
Every family in America has a relative

104
00:11:56,897 --> 00:11:59,714
holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

105
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,054
No, I'm lost, too.
I think she skipped a step.

106
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:08,908
Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab.
He's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

107
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,206
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

108
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:13,115
Leonard is driving Sheldon down there

109
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,655
to help him through this,
because he's such a good man.

110
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,616
Another hug?
Thank you.

111
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,996
All right, you guys, good luck.

112
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,782
Thanks, Penny.
Oh-- break a leg.

113
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,101
Break a leg.

114
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,658
So, road trip to Long Beach.

115
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,371
- We're not going to Long Beach.
- Why not?

116
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:32,350
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

117
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:33,850
Oh, too bad.

118
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,236
I've always wanted
to go to Long Beach.

119
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,827
It's a very nice community.

120
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:40,432
The Queen Mary is docked there.

121
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:43,841
Once the largest ocean liner in the
world, it's now a hotel and restaurant,

122
00:12:44,143 --> 00:12:47,094
where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder mystery dinner.

123
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,093
- Sounds fun.
- I'm game.

124
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:50,908
- Shotgun!
- No, no, no.

125
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:55,345
Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits
in front, and even then, it's iffy.

126
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,531
Wait, are we...

1
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:12,378
Let it go, Sheldon.

2
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,840
The murderer was the first mate
whether it makes sense to you or not.

3
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,977
No, that's the least of our worries.

4
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:20,988
I've been doing
some research on addiction,

5
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,305
both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects--

6
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:26,725
and I think there's a problem
with the current version of our lie.

7
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,854
What are you talking about? It's fine!
She bought it; it's over.

8
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,176
Sadly, it's not.

9
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:38,128
Substance abuse
is a lifelong struggle,

10
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:40,938
but beyond that, I have realized
that the Leo I described

11
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:43,521
- would not have agreed to go to rehab.
- Why not?

12
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:46,245
Because Leo's a middle child.

13
00:13:47,158 --> 00:13:49,468
There is no Leo!
How can you say that?

14
00:13:53,493 --> 00:13:55,338
You didn't read the bio, did you?

15
00:13:56,624 --> 00:13:59,390
He's not just a middle child,
he is the quintessential middle child--

16
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,051
from a broken home, to boot.

17
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:04,147
Psychologically speaking,
the attention he gets by rebelling,

18
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,046
even to the point of self-destruction,
is more emotionally valuable

19
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,883
than the help he would get at rehab.

20
00:14:09,003 --> 00:14:10,927
- I've got a solution.
- Great. What is it?

21
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,116
Get out!

22
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,031
Fine.

23
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:23,282
I've hesitated to point this out,

24
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,923
but I must now remind you
that we are in our current predicament

25
00:14:26,043 --> 00:14:28,478
because of your initial
and totally inadequate deceit.

26
00:14:28,598 --> 00:14:30,581
I'm just trying to clean up
after your mess.

27
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,352
We'll talk in the morning.

28
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,232
Morning.

29
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:52,627
Who are you?

30
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,856
I am Sheldon's cousin Leo.

31
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:02,905
Sheldon does not have
a cousin Leo.

32
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,215
<i>Au contraire.</i>

33
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,365
I'm 26 years old.

34
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:09,537
I'm originally
from... Denton, Texas,

35
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:11,747
but I was a Navy brat,

36
00:15:11,908 --> 00:15:14,672
so I was brought up on a variety
of military bases around the world.

37
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:17,221
As a result, I've often felt
like an outsider--

38
00:15:17,341 --> 00:15:18,790
never really fitting in,

39
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,387
which is probably the reason
for my substance abuse problem.

40
00:15:21,507 --> 00:15:24,301
Excuse me,
we just went over this.

41
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,137
As the quintessential middle child,
your addiction is rooted

42
00:15:27,298 --> 00:15:28,889
in your unmet need for attention.

43
00:15:29,049 --> 00:15:32,268
Sheldon, are we really going
to go with pop psychology?

44
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,812
For your information,
this is based on solid research.

45
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:37,565
Just stick with the character profile
I wrote for you.

46
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:41,294
I'm sorry.
Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld.

47
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:44,140
He's a research assistant
in the particle physics lab,

48
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,657
but he also minored in theater at MIT.

49
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:49,326
It was more of a double major, actually.

50
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,161
Theater and physics.

51
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,789
You can guess which one
my bourgeois parents pushed me toward.

52
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,034
Yeah, I got it.

53
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,251
Sheldon... why?

54
00:15:57,411 --> 00:16:00,260
You see, while Leo
would not have gone into rehab,

55
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,363
it is completely plausible
that we would have talked him

56
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:05,759
into leaving the motel
and coming home with us.

57
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:10,271
How about this as my motivation--
when I was 14 years old,

58
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:13,664
I was abused in the Philippines
by a clubfooted Navy chaplain.

59
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:18,156
No. We're going with middle child

60
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:22,026
and a genetic predisposition to
inadequate serotonin production.

61
00:16:22,186 --> 00:16:24,945
Swell. How do I play
genetic predisposition?

62
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,978
Subtextually, of course.

63
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:32,780
Just have fun with it.

64
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:40,919
- Morning, Penny.
- How did the intervention go?

65
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,506
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to convince him to go to rehab.

66
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:47,146
Based on what you told me,
I am not surprised.

67
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:52,308
But we did convince him
to leave the motel.

68
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,557
Come say hello.

69
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:58,125
This is Penny,

70
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,922
our friend and neighbor.

71
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:01,125
Hi, Leo.

72
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,025
How are you feeling?

73
00:17:08,315 --> 00:17:09,865
Let me ask you something, Penny.

74
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,967
Have you ever woken up
in a fleabag motel,

75
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,740
covered in your own vomit,

76
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,328
next to a transsexual prostitute?

77
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,828
Then don't ask me
how I'm feeling.

78
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:28,348
Well, that's Leo.

79
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,827
why don't you tell me
about your showcase last night.

80
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:35,182
It was okay, I guess.
It wasn't a big turnout,

81
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:37,126
but they both really seemed to like it.

82
00:17:37,246 --> 00:17:38,981
There were only
two people there?

83
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,576
By the end, yeah.

84
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:44,118
Damn you, Chaplain Harrigan!

85
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:47,987
I'm... I'm sorry?

86
00:17:48,148 --> 00:17:49,340
The Philippines.

87
00:17:52,057 --> 00:17:53,424
1992.

88
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,253
The Subic Bay Naval Station.

89
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:59,248
A young boy on the cusp of manhood.

90
00:18:00,015 --> 00:18:01,291
His only companions,

91
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:04,372
mongrel dogs
and malarial mosquitoes.

92
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:06,714
Desperate and alone,

93
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:10,205
he reached out to a man
who promised to introduce him

94
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,594
to a merciful, loving God,

95
00:18:12,754 --> 00:18:15,141
but who instead
introduced him

96
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,518
to a gin-pickled tongue
shoved down his adolescent throat.

97
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,387
What choice did he
have but to drink,

98
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,583
shoot and snort his pain away?

99
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,140
Don't forget his genetic predisposition
towards addiction.

100
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,282
- It's never been proven.
- There have been studies.

101
00:18:34,443 --> 00:18:35,868
Not double-blind studies.

102
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:38,454
How could there be?
Who would be the control group?

103
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,837
As you can see,
detoxing can get pretty ugly.

104
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,579
Let's give them some privacy.

105
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:44,918
Do you want to come over
and have coffee?

106
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:46,249
Sounds good.

107
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:49,131
I have a video of me singing last night.
Do you want to see it?

108
00:18:50,336 --> 00:18:51,867
Gee, why wouldn't I?

109
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:55,081
It's even better than you
coming to the showcase,

110
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,857
now I get to watch you watch me.

111
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,473
Funny how things work out.

112
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,485
...but he loved the companionship
and the wisdom

113
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,982
that his own father failed to provide.

114
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,860
Your parents made the right decision.

115
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,515
I cannot work like this.

116
00:19:27,504 --> 00:19:28,706
This is amazing.

117
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,399
Just sitting on a couch
watching TV with a woman.

118
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,899
Not being drunk or high

119
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:38,351
or wondering
if you're a dude down there.

120
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:43,860
Leo, you are a very sweet,
really funny guy.

121
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,880
You're going to do okay.

122
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,607
One day at a time, Penny.

123
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:53,988
One day at a time.

124
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,295
How long is he going to stay here?

125
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:04,935
He's a homeless drug addict.
Where is he going to go?

126
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,918
Boy, you have a lot
to learn about lying.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
