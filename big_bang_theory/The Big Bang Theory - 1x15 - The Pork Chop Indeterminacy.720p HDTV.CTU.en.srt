1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,216
On the other hand,
some physicists are concerned

2
00:00:02,336 --> 00:00:04,310
that if this supercollider
actually works,

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,523
it'll create a black hole
and swallow up the Earth,

4
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:08,336
ending life as we know it.

5
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:10,237
What a bunch of crybabies.

6
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:12,432
No guts, no glory, man.

7
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:14,863
Hey, check it out.

8
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:18,143
The School of Pharmacology
is looking for volunteers.

9
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,732
"We are testing a new medication
for social anxiety,

10
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,776
"panic attacks, agoraphobia
and obsessive compulsive disorder."

11
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,782
Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

12
00:00:30,134 --> 00:00:31,461
I don't know, Raj.

13
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:34,335
Maybe the comic book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

14
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:40,375
- What's going on?
- Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

15
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:42,629
Sheldon's office?

16
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:46,048
Is she lost?

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,365
I don't think so.

18
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:50,595
I followed her here
from the parking lot.

19
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,123
Maybe she's his lawyer.

20
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,618
Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,188
I know, I'm disgusting.
I should be punished... by her.

22
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:01,727
Look, I did it again.

23
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:03,932
That should do it.

24
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:05,599
Thank you for coming by.

25
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,085
Hello.

26
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,056
Hey, buddy...

27
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:19,679
"Buddy..."?

28
00:01:20,577 --> 00:01:23,336
Sorry I'm late.
I'm working on a project

29
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:26,072
that may take me up
on the next space shuttle.

30
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:29,342
How can you be late?
I wasn't expecting you at all.

31
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:32,929
Nobody ever expects me.
Sometimes you just look and...

32
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,607
Bam! Howard Wolowitz.

33
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,184
Are you gonna introduce us?

34
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,353
All right. This is Missy.

35
00:01:40,676 --> 00:01:44,190
Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

36
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:47,176
- It's nice to meet you.
- You, too, as well, also.

37
00:01:50,046 --> 00:01:51,698
So, how do you two know each other?

38
00:01:52,543 --> 00:01:55,926
He once spent nine months
with my legs wrapped around his head.

39
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,427
Excuse me?

40
00:02:01,557 --> 00:02:03,996
She's my twin sister.
She thinks she's funny,

41
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:06,284
but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

42
00:02:06,404 --> 00:02:09,090
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

43
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:12,015
How exactly would one
measure a sense of humor?

44
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:13,800
A humormometer?

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:18,961
I think you're delightfully droll.

46
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,559
Or, as the French say,
<i>très drôle</i>.

47
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:23,730
So let me see if I got this.

48
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,733
Leonard, Howard and...

49
00:02:26,894 --> 00:02:28,935
I'm sorry, what was your name again?

50
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,729
Rajesh.

51
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Season 1 Episode 15:
The Pork Chop Indeterminacy

1
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,600
So Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

2
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,900
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

3
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,700
My friend's getting married
at Disneyland tomorrow night.

4
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,100
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

5
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,000
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my Dad's estate.

6
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,600
The papers could've been mailed.
Mom sent you to spy on me, didn't she?

7
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,100
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

8
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,700
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

9
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,500
Tell Mom that
I currently weigh 165 pounds

10
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,900
and that I'm having
regular bowel movements.

11
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,700
Enjoy the wedding. Good-bye.

12
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,300
If the wedding's not until tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?

13
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

14
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,600
Even as a little boy,
he'd send his imaginary friends home

15
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,000
at the end of the day.

16
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,600
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

17
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,900
Look, you're here.
We have plenty of room.

18
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
No, we don't.

19
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,500
Come on, Shelly.
She's family.

20
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,800
So what, I don't issue invitations
to your mother.

21
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,700
It would be nice not to have
to drive to Anaheim in rush hour.

22
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,600
And don't ever call me Shelly.

23
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,300
So it's settled: you'll stay with us.

24
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, I'll walk you to your car.
You're in structure 3, level C, right?

25
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,300
What just happened?

26
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,400
So anyway, we're eight years old

27
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,600
and Sheldon converts
my Easy Bake Oven

28
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
to some kind
of high-powered furnace.

29
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,900
Just classic.

30
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
I needed a place to fire
ceramic semiconductor substrates

31
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
for homemade integrated circuits.

32
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
He was trying to build
some sort of armed robot

33
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
to keep me out of his room.

34
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,300
Made necessary by her insistence
on going into my room.

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Anyway, I go to make
those little corn muffins they give you.

36
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,000
There's a big flash. Next thing you know
my eyebrows are gone.

37
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Not your eyebrows!

38
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade

39
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,100
with crooked eyebrows
my mom drew on.

40
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
Is that what that was?

41
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I just assumed that the second grade
curriculum had rendered you quizzical.

42
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,000
You left your underwear
in the dryer downstairs.

43
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
Those are not mine.

44
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,300
Really? They have
your little name label in them.

45
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,800
Yeah, no, I do... I use those...

46
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,600
just to polish up
my spearfishing equipment.

47
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,900
I spearfish.

48
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,600
When I'm not crossbow hunting,
I spearfish.

49
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,000
This is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy.

50
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,700
This is our neighbor, Penny.

51
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,100
- You don't look that much alike.
- Can I get a hallelujah?

52
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,600
Fraternal twins come
from two separate eggs.

53
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,800
They are no more alike
than any other siblings.

54
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Hey, guess what.
I've been accepted

55
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,400
as a test subject for a new miracle drug
to overcome pathological shyness.

56
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,500
- Good for you, Raj.
- Yes, I'm very hopeful. Hello, Missy.

57
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,500
They mentioned
there may be side effects.

58
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,700
So, Missy,

59
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,900
have you ever met a man
from the exotic subcontinent of India?

60
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Well, there's Dr. Patel at our church.

61
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
Yes, Patel... good man.

62
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,900
Do you like motorcycles?
'Cause I ride a hog.

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
A hog? You have a two-cylinder scooter
with a basket in the front.

64
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,100
You still have to wear a helmet.

65
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,000
Have you ever heard
of the Kama Sutra?

66
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,600
- The sex book.
- The Indian sex book.

67
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,900
In other words,
if you "wonder, wonder

68
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,700
who wrote the book of love,"
it was us.

69
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
- Sheldon's sister is pretty cute, huh?
- I wasn't staring.

70
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
I didn't say you were.
I just said she was cute.

71
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Maybe,

72
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,800
if you like women who are tall...

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,200
and perfect.

74
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,300
Sheldon, why are you
ignoring your sister?

75
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm not ignoring my sister.
I'm ignoring all of you.

76
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,100
I brought snacks!

77
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, my, gherkins and...

78
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,300
Onion dip. It's onion dip.

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,600
We don't entertain much.

80
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,200
Missy.
Do you enjoy pajamas?

81
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
- I guess.
- We Indians invented them.

82
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,300
You're welcome.

83
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, well, my people
invented circumcision.

84
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,800
You're welcome.

85
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,100
Missy, I'm gonna go get my nails done.
Do you want to come?

86
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,500
God, yes.
Thanks.

87
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,100
You're welcome.

88
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,800
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Missy, see you.

89
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,000
- Goodbye, Leonard.
- Oh, yeah, no, bye, Penny.

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,500
You two have to back off.

91
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,500
Why should I back off?
You back off, dude.

92
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,200
Excuse me, this is my apartment,
and she's my roommate's sister.

93
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,100
- So what? You've already got Penny!
- How do I have Penny?

94
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
In what universe do I have Penny?

95
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
- So I can have Penny?
- Hell, no!

96
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,100
Excuse me.
Can I interject something?

97
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm ordering pizza online.
Is everyone okay with pepperoni?

98
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,300
- Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?
- I guess.

99
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,100
Don't worry. I was going
to order you cheese-less.

100
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,600
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

101
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Lactose intolerance
is nothing to be embarrassed about.

102
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm a fancy Indian man.
We invented pajamas.

103
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Hey, look at me.
I don't have a foreskin.

104
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,200
Are you aware that your sister
is an incredibly attractive woman?

105
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,200
She certainly has the symmetry
and low body fat

106
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,500
that Western culture deems desirable.

107
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,800
It's noteworthy,
at other points in history,

108
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
heavier women
were the standard for beauty

109
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,300
because their girth
suggested affluence.

110
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,600
That's fascinating...

111
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,500
I didn't say it was fascinating.
I said it was noteworthy.

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,700
All right... noted.

113
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,700
But my point is
that Koothrappali and Wolowitz,

114
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,500
they're hitting on your sister.

115
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay.

116
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,200
You know, I don't want to criticize
your rhetorical style,

117
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,600
but we'd be a lot further along
in this conversation

118
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,500
if you'd begun with that thought.

119
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,300
- Great...
- I'm saying

120
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,500
we took quite an unnecessary detour from
what I now understand to be your thesis.

121
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,600
Whatever.

122
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,100
You have to do something about it.

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,000
- Why?
- Because she's your sister.

124
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't understand.

125
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,600
Yes, we shared a uterus
for nine months,

126
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
but since then we've pretty much
gone our own separate ways.

127
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,100
Okay, consider this.

128
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
With your father gone,

129
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,800
it is your responsibility

130
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
to make sure that Missy
chooses a suitable mate.

131
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,700
I hadn't considered that.

132
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,400
We do share DNA.

133
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,200
So there is the possibility,
however remote,

134
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,000
that resting in her loins

135
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,600
is the potential for another individual
as remarkable as myself.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Exactly.

137
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,600
And you owe it to yourself
and to posterity

138
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,400
to protect the genetic integrity
of your sister's future offspring.

139
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,800
You're right.

140
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,400
If someone wants to get
at Missy's Fallopian tubes,

141
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,300
they'll have to go through me.

142
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,800
I am Shiva the Destroyer!

143
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,600
I will have the woman.

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm warning you,
I was judo champion at math camp.

145
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,700
All right, now that's enough
juvenile squabbling.

146
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,500
You stop it. Stop it, I say!

147
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I'm going to settle this right now.

148
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,500
Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.

149
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,300
Who are you to decide that?

150
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,400
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.

151
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
- You're out, too, by the way.
- Say what?

152
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,700
It's nothing personal. I'd just prefer

153
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,000
if my future niece or nephew
didn't become flatulent

154
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,200
every time they ate an eskimo pie.

155
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
What are you so happy about?

156
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
I'm not happy.

157
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
It's the medication.
I can't stop smiling.

158
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,500
Now that Leonard's made me aware
how high the genetic stakes are...

159
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,800
we have to face the fact that none of
you are suitable mates for my sister.

160
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,800
Wait a minute.
Leonard made you aware of that?

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,700
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

162
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,900
Excuse me, I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

163
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,900
How so?

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,300
Everybody knows genetic diversity
produces the strongest offspring.

165
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,900
Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

166
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,500
In principle, you have a point.

167
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
But as a practical matter,
need I remind you

168
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
that it takes experimental
pharmaceuticals

169
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex.

170
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.

171
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
Is it 'cause I'm Jewish?

172
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
'Cause I'd kill my rabbi
with a pork chop to be with your sister.

173
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,900
This has nothing to do with religion.

174
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,500
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny, tiny man

175
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,500
who still lives with his mother.

176
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,600
Sheldon, you are really
being unreasonable.

177
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,700
Am I?

178
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,900
Here, eat this cheese without farting
and you can sleep with my sister.

179
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh, really?

180
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?

181
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,900
Alone.

182
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Why does everyone suddenly
want to talk to me alone?

183
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.

184
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,400
We all make mistakes.
Let's move on.

185
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm not even going to ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese.

186
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,600
But since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?

187
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,000
Truthfully, I've never given it
any thought,

188
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,600
but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.

189
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,600
- What on earth are you talking about?
- Let me explain.

190
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,900
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation,

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,100
an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.

192
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,600
And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
That would be you.

194
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,600
But residing within you,
is the potential for another me.

195
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,600
Perhaps even taller, smarter,
and less prone to freckling,

196
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,900
a Sheldon 2.0, if you will.

197
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,800
"Sheldon 2.0"?

198
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Exactly.

199
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,000
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.

200
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,900
If you're not attracted to the suitor,

201
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,100
the likelihood of conception
will be reduced.

202
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,400
- You have got to be kidding me.
- Not at all.

203
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Frequent coitus dramatically
increases the odds of fertilization.

204
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay, Shelly, sit down.

205
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,900
Now I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is,

206
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,500
as mom puts it,

207
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,100
"one of God's special, little people".

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I always thought I was more
like a cuckoo bird.

209
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,500
You know, a superior creature whose egg
is placed in the nest of ordinary birds.

210
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,100
Of course, the newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food,

211
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,600
leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.

212
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,300
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,900
I thought it ended at "cuckoo".

214
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,000
You listen to me.

215
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,600
If you want to start acting
like a brother who cares about me,

216
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,900
then terrific. Bring it on.

217
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,100
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with,

218
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,100
and you and I are going
to go round and round

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,700
the way we did when we were little.
Remember?

220
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,000
- I have an alternate proposal.
- Go on.

221
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,900
You donate eggs.

222
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,900
We will place them in cryogenic storage.

223
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,000
I will find an appropriate
sperm donor for your eggs,

224
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,500
have them fertilized
and implanted in you.

225
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
That way, everybody wins.

226
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
Correction.

227
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,000
Missy can date whoever she wants.

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
Look, we have to settle this.

229
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I agree.

230
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her

231
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,900
- at the same time.
- She's not hiding.

232
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She needed privacy to call her
grandmother who's apparently very sick.

233
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,400
And then I believe
she has to wash her hair.

234
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,700
You poor, deluded bastard.

235
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,500
- Don't start with me.
- You want to go again? Let's go.

236
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Sit down.

237
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,100
If we're going to fight over Missy,
let's do it the right way.

238
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,700
The honorable way.

239
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,500
Take that!

240
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,600
You want some more?

241
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,400
And he's down!

242
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,200
One, two, three...

243
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,300
Come on! Get up!

244
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,800
Stay down, bitch!

245
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,800
Nine, ten.

246
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Natural selection at work.

247
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,500
I weep for humanity.

248
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,100
Excuse me while I go tell
Missy the good news.

249
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,800
- Leonard.
- Hi, Penny. How's it going?

250
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,400
That guy Mike that you were dating,
is that still going on?

251
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Pretty much. Why?

252
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,700
Nothing, just catching up. By the way,
may I speak to Missy, please?

253
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,400
Of course.

254
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,600
- Hi, Leonard. What's up?
- Since you're leaving tomorrow,

255
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,000
I was wondering
if you'd like to go to dinner with me.

256
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
That's so sweet. But no thanks.

257
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,200
- Do you have other plans or...
- No.

258
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,400
All right.

259
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,400
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thanks. See ya.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Here's something we didn't anticipate.

261
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,600
What do you want, Howard?

262
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,300
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

263
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,400
I've come to call on Missy.

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,200
- Hi, Howard.
- The Amazing Howard.

265
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,500
- Do you like magic?
- Not really. No.

266
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,800
Then you are in for a treat.

267
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,200
Behold, an ordinary cane.

268
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
Thank you. I apprec...

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,600
Apprec...

270
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
Appree...

271
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh, honey.
Is your medication wearing off?

272
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Well, hi, cutie pie.

273
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,200
I was hoping you'd show up.

274
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,700
We had a dog who made
a noise like that.

275
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
Had to put him down.

1
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Any news you want me
to pass on to Mom?

2
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, she might be interested to know
that I have refocused my research

3
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,100
from bosonic string theory
to heterotic string theory.

4
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,100
I'll just tell her you say "hey".

5
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Well, it was pleasant seeing you,

6
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,500
other than that business
with my testicles.

7
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,800
Come on, Shelly.

8
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
I want you to know
I'm very proud of you.

9
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,100
Really?

10
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Yep, I'm always bragging to my friends
about my brother, the rocket scientist.

11
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,900
You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?

12
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,100
Well, yeah.

13
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm a theoretical physicist.

14
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
- What's the difference?
- What's the difference?

15
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,900
Good bye, Shelly.

16
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,900
My God!

17
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,700
Why don't you just tell them that I'm
a toll-taker at the Golden Gate Bridge?

18
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,900
Rocket scientist. How humiliating.
