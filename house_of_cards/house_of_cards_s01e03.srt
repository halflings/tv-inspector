1
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:59,925
Page 43, section 7.
We'd like some clarification.

3
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:01,524
Section 7 has to do with
the evaluative measures--

4
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:03,165
"Evaluative measures."

5
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,324
What we're talking about here
are performance standards,

6
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:05,804
plain and simple.

7
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:06,885
We can't have that.
We open that can of worms--

8
00:01:06,886 --> 00:01:07,964
Gotta take it out, Frank.

9
00:01:07,965 --> 00:01:09,243
The administration wants it in.

10
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:10,882
Then we're all wasting
our time.

11
00:01:10,883 --> 00:01:12,323
Well, look, I can cut down
the frequency of testing,

12
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:13,923
but it's got to be
part of the overall--

13
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:15,402
That's the thin edge
of a two-ton wedge.

14
00:01:15,403 --> 00:01:16,802
- No way, non-debatable.
- All right, hold on.

15
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:17,922
There's no harm
in hearing them out, right?

16
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,442
Frank, what do you have
in mind?

17
00:01:19,443 --> 00:01:21,681
We adjust article 4.
Hand me article 4.

18
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,881
We go every three years
instead of two.

19
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:26,241
Frank, for us to even
consider testing--

20
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:28,360
Marty, we can't
negotiate time intervals here.

21
00:01:28,361 --> 00:01:30,001
If-- I'm just saying if--

22
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:32,120
The frequency could never be
more than five years.

23
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:34,159
Look, five is a little high,
but if you can bend on that--

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,359
- Marty.
- Wait, wait, wait. And it's not just frequency.

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,199
Veteran teachers would have
to be exempt

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,758
if they have a proven record of
excellence with the students.

27
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,998
Well, excuse me for a moment.

28
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:43,438
Corey, will you take
the reins on this?

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,398
Right, so, article 4--
in terms of exceptions--

30
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,118
I've been saying for years
that we should tear it down.

31
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:51,597
It's vulgar, it's an
embarrassment to the county,

32
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,236
but time and time again
Frank Underwood

33
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,517
has fought to keep it standing.

34
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,076
If it weren't for him,

35
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,676
the Peachoid would've been
replaced ages ago.

36
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:02,115
And Jessica masters
would still be alive.

37
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,834
The congressman needs
to answer for this tragedy.

38
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,274
What exactly happened?

39
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,395
A 17-year-old girl

40
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,753
ran off the road texting
her boyfriend, and I quote,

41
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:13,594
"doesn't the Peachoid
look like a giant..."

42
00:02:13,595 --> 00:02:15,793
- And then she lost control of the car.
- Jesus.

43
00:02:15,794 --> 00:02:18,192
Orrin's making a big fuss
in the local press.

44
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,072
And he's pushing
the parents to sue Gaffney.

45
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,951
Sue Gaffney?
It's in his own jurisdiction.

46
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,592
It's worth throwing
Gaffney under the bus

47
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:25,712
to drag you into the mess.

48
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,271
He's after my seat again.

49
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,231
Has he learned
absolutely nothing?

50
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,951
It's a full-on smear
campaign, boss.

51
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,470
He's out to destroy you.

52
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,150
With this? It's a peach,
for Christ sake.

53
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:36,870
Let him make a fool
out of himself.

54
00:02:36,871 --> 00:02:39,309
No, he will make a fool
out of you.

55
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,429
If he spins this right,
gets national coverage--

56
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,509
National coverage?
It's a joke.

57
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,629
And you will be the butt of it.

58
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,669
We can't afford that right now,

59
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,107
not when you're in the spotlight
with the education bill.

60
00:02:50,108 --> 00:02:52,588
This thing has caused me
so much damn trouble.

61
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,387
- I know.
- So who should I call, parents?

62
00:02:55,388 --> 00:02:57,107
Phone call's
not going to cut it.

63
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:58,906
- You need to go down there.
- Can it wait until Monday?

64
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,226
We get on this thing right now,
we can contain it.

65
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,226
We wait until Monday,

66
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:04,385
then there's no way to know how much
this is going to blow up on us.

67
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:05,945
I can't go down to Gaffney.
The unions have just--

68
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:07,265
- We postpone--
- They're gonna be livid.

69
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:08,344
Marty's reasonable, okay?

70
00:03:08,345 --> 00:03:09,825
He will explain to them.

71
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,264
And they're just supposed
to understand and accept

72
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,823
that I had to get up
from the negotiating table

73
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,704
because some two-bit county
administrator wants to--

74
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:16,384
I don't want
to interrupt you, sir,

75
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,623
but this is not just
about Orrin.

76
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:19,344
It's about the parents.

77
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:22,823
Now, you think
about the lawsuit.

78
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,142
What happens
if you have to testify?

79
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:28,341
Subpoenas, depositions.

80
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,060
You get dragged
into a court battle,

81
00:03:30,061 --> 00:03:32,061
there is no education bill.

82
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:35,301
We can't ignore this.

83
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,580
I just hate
this small-ball crap.

84
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,365
It's called the what?
The peach what?

85
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:14,565
The Peachoid.

86
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,485
It's a giant water tower

87
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:17,604
in the shape of a peach.

88
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:20,364
Oh, wow.

89
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,763
I just googled it.
"The Peachoid."

90
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:24,523
She was 17, Linda.

91
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,363
You're right.
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,443
- I need another week.
- No, that's not going to work.

93
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:29,523
The president makes
his speech on Tuesday.

94
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:30,523
We've already announced.

95
00:05:30,524 --> 00:05:32,202
Speeches can be rescheduled.

96
00:05:32,203 --> 00:05:34,241
We have to show some progress
on education, Frank.

97
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:35,921
The first hundred days
is almost over.

98
00:05:35,922 --> 00:05:37,441
If we push back the speech,

99
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:38,881
it'll look like we're
spinning our wheels.

100
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,041
All right,
I'll work something out.

101
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,481
Thank you, Linda.

102
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,559
Frank, these are the heads

103
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,840
of the two largest teachers
unions in the country.

104
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,039
- I understand.
- They flew here on a weekend.

105
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,959
Doug will lead the charge.
Congressman Phillips is well vetted--

106
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,038
They flew here to see you,
Frank.

107
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,038
You're managing this bill.

108
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,399
Put this in the other bag.

109
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,877
And I'll be in
constant communication.

110
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:00,398
Anything big comes up,
I'm a phone call away.

111
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,077
It's a 300-page document.

112
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:03,598
We need you in that room.

113
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,757
I would stay if I could,

114
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:06,237
but this is my home district.

115
00:06:06,238 --> 00:06:08,117
Now, Marty,
cut me a little slack here.

116
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,596
We'll get it done.

117
00:06:09,597 --> 00:06:11,076
You and I go way back.

118
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:13,435
Have I ever let you down?

119
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:14,636
No, you haven't.

120
00:06:14,637 --> 00:06:17,155
And I don't intend
to start now.

121
00:06:24,753 --> 00:06:26,474
Hello?

122
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,510
- Gillian?
- Claire.

123
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,269
It's so nice
to finally meet you.

124
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,589
Yeah-- I'm a little
under the weather.

125
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:56,989
I don't want to get you sick.

126
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,468
Well, if you're feeling ill,
we can--

127
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:59,748
No, no, no, I'm fine.
It's just a cold.

128
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,428
Well, thank you for coming in.

129
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,428
Of course.

130
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:03,588
Shall we talk in my office?

131
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,026
These are really cool
photographs.

132
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:07,147
Oh, thank you.

133
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:08,946
Adam Galloway
took the pictures.

134
00:07:08,947 --> 00:07:09,987
Have you heard of him?

135
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,547
No.

136
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:13,466
I met him at the Whitney
biennial a couple years ago

137
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,627
and commissioned him
to do these.

138
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:17,745
He just had a big show at ps1.

139
00:07:17,746 --> 00:07:19,345
I'm not up to date
on the art world.

140
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:20,945
That's all right.

141
00:07:20,946 --> 00:07:22,945
We're not here to talk
about photography. Are we?

142
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,585
My office is over here.

143
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:25,624
You run into any trouble,
you call me.

144
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,665
I got it covered.

145
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,744
Gene Clancy know I'm coming?

146
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:28,704
Just spoke to him.

147
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:30,103
Get to it.

148
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:31,624
Your flight is booked,
leaves in 55 minutes.

149
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:32,783
Ed will be joining you.

150
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,103
Where's Steve?

151
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:36,022
He went home sick
about an hour ago, sir.

152
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,343
I'll be filling in.

153
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,742
What's your name again?
Edward what?

154
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:40,543
- Meacham.
- You drive fast, Meacham?

155
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,419
You wanted to talk to me?

156
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,979
Come on, Zoe.
This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of--

157
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,739
She knows who I am.

158
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,299
Mrs. Tilden liked your profile
on Catherine Durant.

159
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,979
No, I didn't.
I loved it.

160
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,298
In depth, uncompromising.

161
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,418
Normally I don't read things
before they go to print,

162
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:09,097
but Cathy's a friend.

163
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:12,817
Tell me how you knew she'd be
nominated before she did?

164
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:13,937
You want my source?

165
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:15,617
Tom says you won't tell him.

166
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:16,656
I haven't told anyone.

167
00:08:16,657 --> 00:08:18,055
Well, I own the paper.

168
00:08:18,056 --> 00:08:20,376
And I'm very grateful
to be working here.

169
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:22,095
So you're not going to tell
me either.

170
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,416
Which do you want,
my source or my integrity?

171
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,654
Tom.

172
00:08:31,295 --> 00:08:35,254
Move Zoe's piece to the front
page of Sunday's edition.

173
00:08:35,255 --> 00:08:36,453
Let me think that over.

174
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:38,413
You think it over
as much as you want.

175
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,853
Then put it on the front page.

176
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,251
I've worked really hard to gain
a foothold with world well.

177
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:55,050
Six years ago it was just
me and a macbook.

178
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,730
I understand.

179
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,610
And I had to juggle two
temp jobs just to pay the rent.

180
00:08:58,611 --> 00:09:00,929
It's your baby.
You don't want to let it go.

181
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,009
Well, I just--

182
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,729
And you wouldn't have to,
Gillian.

183
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,248
All I want is for you to grow
what you've already built.

184
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,568
I heard you fired
half your staff.

185
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,007
Yes, I did.

186
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:14,967
That worries me.

187
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:18,886
I let them go to make room
for you.

188
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:21,327
I'm just not sure
we're the right match.

189
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,446
To be honest,
I'm a little uncomfortable

190
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:25,605
working with someone who's
commissioning famous photographers

191
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:29,285
when I can't even buy my
volunteers bus fair to the office.

192
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:31,084
Do you know
who Nicky Hemler is?

193
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,604
No.

194
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,163
Nicky owns one of the
biggest galleries in Chelsea.

195
00:09:35,164 --> 00:09:38,484
She desperately wanted
to represent Adam Galloway.

196
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,803
I delivered on Adam,

197
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:41,204
and in return she contributes

198
00:09:41,204 --> 00:09:43,763
almost 40 grand a year to CWI.

199
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,922
That money goes
to impact studies,

200
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:48,402
lobbying efforts, research.

201
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:51,401
World well could benefit from
that sort of money, Gillian,

202
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:54,881
and we can benefit
from your expertise.

203
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,480
Can I think about it?

204
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Of course.

205
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,319
We don't have to jump
into anything.

206
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,558
I grew up here,
in the up country--

207
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,519
Bibles, barbecues,
and broken backs.

208
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,518
Everything gets
just a little bit thicker

209
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,918
this far south--

210
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,598
The air, the blood, even me.

211
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,798
I try to make it down here
at least once a month.

212
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,637
Every trip is a reminder
of how far I've come.

213
00:10:20,638 --> 00:10:22,356
I hated Gaffney as a kid,

214
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,916
when I had nothing,

215
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,396
but now I've come
to appreciate it.

216
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,436
It's not as suffocating
as it once was,

217
00:10:28,437 --> 00:10:30,156
except when I have to deal
with the sort of nonsense

218
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:31,634
that makes me want
to hang myself.

219
00:10:31,635 --> 00:10:33,394
Turn left on route one--

220
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:34,834
Don't listen to her.
I know a better way.

221
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,075
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:37,354
We don't have the money, Frank.

223
00:10:37,355 --> 00:10:39,714
The legal bills alone
will kill us.

224
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,514
How about a settlement?

225
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,754
I'll look at the numbers.

226
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:45,393
What's it look like to you?

227
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,793
Like a peach.

228
00:10:46,794 --> 00:10:49,872
No, I mean what does it
really look like?

229
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:53,751
As mayor, I stick with a peach.

230
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,112
As a private citizen,

231
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,791
well, it looks like the sun
is shining

232
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,071
where it shouldn't be.

233
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,149
There's a
better way to handle this.

234
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,790
Really, Frank?
And what's that?

235
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,789
I'm not trying to start
an argument here.

236
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,868
You make it sound
like I'm in the wrong.

237
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,509
No, you know exactly
what you're doing, Orrin.

238
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,149
You're using
this poor girl's death

239
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,269
for your own political
advantage.

240
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,587
You're the one that fought me

241
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:17,628
when the peach farmers
bitched and moaned

242
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:18,867
about me tearing it down.

243
00:11:18,868 --> 00:11:20,267
You're the one
that took their money.

244
00:11:20,268 --> 00:11:22,067
- It's a water tower.
- It's ungodly.

245
00:11:22,068 --> 00:11:23,507
- Orrin.
- This is cut and dry, Frank.

246
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,266
I fought to tear it down.

247
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,706
You fought to keep it up.

248
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:29,026
That girl's blood
is on your hands,

249
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:30,906
and I'm taking you
to task for it.

250
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:34,545
All right, I'll tell you what.

251
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,545
Dick Peters is going
to retire this term.

252
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:40,543
That means there's an open
race in the fourth district.

253
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,264
How about I help you
lock up that seat?

254
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,503
I'm not looking to make
a deal, Frank.

255
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,144
It's not a deal.

256
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:47,663
It's an opportunity.

257
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,063
I'll be just fine.

258
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:55,743
You may despise me, Orrin,

259
00:11:55,743 --> 00:11:56,981
but the classy thing to do

260
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,021
would've been to invite us up

261
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:59,702
for some of that iced tea.

262
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:38,815
What are you doing?

263
00:12:40,695 --> 00:12:41,973
You shouldn't run here.

264
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,695
It's disgraceful.

265
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,775
Have you no respect?

266
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,730
The criteria
is a starting point.

267
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:10,090
They're suggested,
not mandated.

268
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,850
We assemble
a council of experts

269
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:13,369
who will determine exactly--

270
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,568
Nowhere here does it say
who these experts are,

271
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:16,849
how they'll be chosen.

272
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,329
The president selects
the council.

273
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,608
What sort of oversight?

274
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:20,928
We'd like input
on the selection.

275
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:22,129
Doug, check with Linda.

276
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,728
Calling her now.

277
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:28,127
Okay, so now can we talk
about charter schools?

278
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:29,327
Charter schools are a no-go.

279
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:30,447
They have to be in there.

280
00:13:30,448 --> 00:13:31,567
You keep them in, we walk.

281
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,647
The same goes for us.

282
00:13:32,648 --> 00:13:34,486
Let's not jump to ultimatums.

283
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,126
Well, let's figure out a way
to reduce non-public spending.

284
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:38,845
All right, give me a few
minutes to think about that.

285
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:41,365
We can't move forward
without addressing this point.

286
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:44,364
- I understand, but this is the cornerstone of the bill.
- Let's talk it out.

287
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,605
Give me five minutes, Marty.
I'll call you right back.

288
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,203
No-- no--

289
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:49,804
If we consider
settlement as an option,

290
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:51,123
we need to be able
to pay for it.

291
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:52,723
But if we offer a settlement,

292
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:54,764
- aren't we saying--
- That's my point.

293
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,363
We're admitting that
the town's responsible

294
00:13:56,364 --> 00:13:57,723
for this kid's death.

295
00:13:57,724 --> 00:13:59,882
I say make the peach farmers
cough it up.

296
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:01,442
Oh, man, talk about
a shit storm.

297
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:02,922
Y'all mind catchin' me up?

298
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,721
Wayne and Travis
want to go to court.

299
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:06,321
I don't think
that's a good idea.

300
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,121
We can't be pouring
money into a settlement

301
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:09,560
when we can barely afford
to run the city.

302
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,320
What do you think, gene?

303
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:14,400
I think that we gotta worry about
the peach farmers association.

304
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,719
If there is a hint that
we're blaming the Peachoid,

305
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,119
they're going to raise
holy hell.

306
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,959
Who gives a crap.
They gotta suck it up.

307
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,359
Let him talk.

308
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,399
I'm just saying that we need
to keep them in mind.

309
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,078
She was breaking the law.
End of story.

310
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,398
You can't text while you drive.

311
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,997
Yeah, but all
a jury's going to see

312
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:33,356
is a beautiful 17-year-old
girl who's now dead.

313
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,117
No offense, Frank,
but you just got here.

314
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:36,917
We've been dealing with this
for the last week now.

315
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,396
And where's your solution?

316
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:39,756
What?

317
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:40,996
You think you know
better than us?

318
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,796
I'm just trying to be
realistic.

319
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:44,476
Frank, I know you want
to swoop down

320
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,834
and save the day,

321
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,515
but there's a principle
at stake here.

322
00:14:47,516 --> 00:14:49,194
We allow ourselves
to be extorted

323
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,555
because of this teenager--

324
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,954
When Orrin gets a jury to weep
a river of snot

325
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:52,914
over this dead girl,

326
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:54,754
when Gaffney goes tits up

327
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:57,154
because you can't afford to pay a
seven-figure award in damages,

328
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:58,593
when you all get booted
out of office

329
00:14:58,594 --> 00:14:59,993
and I lose to Chase,

330
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:02,033
then you can chew my ear off
about principles,

331
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,112
because we'll all have
nothing but time on our hands.

332
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,512
Until then,

333
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,552
you either contribute,

334
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,831
or you keep it shut, Travis.

335
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,151
Now, here's
what we're going to do.

336
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:11,631
Gene, how much
can we pull together

337
00:15:11,632 --> 00:15:13,231
- for a settlement if we had to?
- About 150.

338
00:15:13,232 --> 00:15:14,710
That'll work.

339
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:15,830
Jamie, get your boys down
to the hardware store

340
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,311
to build two billboards.

341
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,070
Put them out a mile out on
either side of the tower.

342
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:21,549
Have them read, "drive safely.
No texting behind the wheel."

343
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,070
- Got it.
- And get those up by tomorrow morning.

344
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,509
I'll issue the permits.

345
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,829
And let's stop lighting
the thing at night.

346
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,268
The peach farmers
aren't going to like that.

347
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:29,828
Well, how much does
the electric cost?

348
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:32,268
4,100 plus change per month.

349
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,867
About 50,000 a year.

350
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:37,267
Jesus, you could put
a kid through college on--

351
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:40,226
Let's use that money to start
a scholarship fund in her name.

352
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:41,866
Meantime, you tell
the association,

353
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,666
if they want it lit up,
they can pay for it.

354
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:45,226
I'll deliver
that message happily.

355
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,945
And do me up a budget
and a plan

356
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,065
for removing the sphincter.

357
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,106
The what?

358
00:15:49,107 --> 00:15:50,945
He means the emergency valve.

359
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:52,264
That's interesting.

360
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,184
I always thought
of it as a clitoris.

361
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:55,825
But it's on bottom.

362
00:15:55,826 --> 00:15:57,704
I believe the clitoris
is above the--

363
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,863
But if you imagine a woman
on her belly--

364
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:03,143
Enough. I want it done.

365
00:16:03,144 --> 00:16:06,903
And, gene, give me everything
you've got on road regulations.

366
00:16:06,904 --> 00:16:09,062
County statutes, not municipal.

367
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:10,702
And do you remember
that power line business

368
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,901
we pulled up
at the last election?

369
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:13,381
Sure do.

370
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:15,621
Let's make sure
we're rock solid on that.

371
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:19,020
Does this very expensive dinner

372
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,180
at least buy me an evening

373
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,060
of mind-blowing
sexual congress?

374
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,699
It was good, but I don't know
if it was that good.

375
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,779
Fellatio good?

376
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,339
Hand job maybe.
No promises.

377
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,299
Deal.

378
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,818
Okay, um, Peter, there's
something I need to tell you.

379
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:38,018
I have been thinking lately.

380
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:41,417
You know, um, it might be good
to work somewhere else.

381
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,016
So I did some interviews,

382
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:46,056
and the speaker's office
offered me deputy LD.

383
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:52,016
Peter.

384
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,175
Christina, um--

385
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,415
I just thought
it could be good, right,

386
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,095
if we're going to have
any future,

387
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:57,694
to stop this
boss-staffer thing

388
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:58,694
and be a real couple.

389
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:00,253
We are a real couple.

390
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:03,654
I mean not have to hide it
like we do at the office.

391
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,533
And it's a great opportunity.

392
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:07,892
The speaker?

393
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,892
Would you hate me
if I took the job?

394
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:18,411
Baby, I want what you want.

395
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,171
I'm not--
I won't fight you on this,

396
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,410
not if this is what
you feel you need to do.

397
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,690
- Really?
- Yeah.

398
00:17:24,691 --> 00:17:26,289
And you're right.

399
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,330
This is a great opportunity.

400
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,129
When do you have
to tell them by?

401
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:31,409
There's no deadline.
I don't have to decide right away.

402
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,769
Okay, well, when you decide,

403
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,808
just, you know, help me find
a replacement.

404
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,208
You know, give me a heads-up.

405
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,647
Yeah, of course.

406
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:41,447
I haven't even decided
if I'm going to take it.

407
00:17:41,448 --> 00:17:43,007
We don't have to talk this
through right now.

408
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,647
I just-- I just thought
I'd bring it up.

409
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:51,686
Should we get out of here?

410
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:52,766
Yes.

411
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:06,963
Let's go find the parents.

412
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:08,362
You hang back by the car.

413
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:10,322
It's a big crowd, sir.

414
00:18:11,363 --> 00:18:13,482
If I get shot or stabbed

415
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,042
consoling two grieving parents,

416
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:17,682
I'm a hero from now
until the end of time.

417
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,482
Let's roll the dice.
Shall we?

418
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,642
Sir, I can't allow you
to go unescorted

419
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,161
into all those people.

420
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:27,080
Allow me?

421
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,840
Let's get one thing
straight, Meacham.

422
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,039
You are never to dictate
what I can and cannot do.

423
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,999
The only two words
I want to hear from you

424
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,199
when I ask you to do something

425
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
are "yes" and "sir."

426
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,358
Is that understood?

427
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,839
Yes, sir.

428
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,438
Good. Then we're gonna
get along just fine.

429
00:18:52,676 --> 00:18:57,275
Mr. and Mrs. masters, I'm Frank
Underwood, your congressman.

430
00:18:57,276 --> 00:19:00,395
I'm so sorry for your loss.

431
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:01,875
I cannot begin to fathom--

432
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,354
You're right. You can't.
You have no idea.

433
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,953
Forgive me.
I don't mean to intrude. I just--

434
00:19:06,954 --> 00:19:08,954
- Well, you are intruding.
- Dean, please.

435
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:10,033
What?

436
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,194
It's his fault.
Isn't it?

437
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,113
Anyway, I just wanted
to express my condolences,

438
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:15,712
and say if there's anything
the two of you nee--

439
00:19:15,713 --> 00:19:18,552
Dean, you don't want to be
talking to him.

440
00:19:18,553 --> 00:19:20,192
We got legal action pending.

441
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:22,511
Look, I know what Mr. Chase
has been saying, and believe--

442
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,911
Nobody invited you.

443
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,271
Nobody wants your condolences

444
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:26,270
or your excuses.

445
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:28,230
Frank, please.

446
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,070
You shouldn't have to put up
with this right now.

447
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,109
I'm sorry.

448
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,148
Well, that went well.

449
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:46,868
Hang on a second.
Reverend.

450
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,107
Congressman.

451
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:50,787
Nice to see you again.

452
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,947
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

453
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:53,906
Terrible, isn't it?

454
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,467
It's just terrible.

455
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:57,306
This is so thoughtful
what you've organized here.

456
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:58,745
Least we can do.

457
00:19:58,746 --> 00:20:01,346
Tell me, are the masters
in your congregation?

458
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:03,745
They are.
They come every Sunday.

459
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:06,065
Do you think they'll be
at the service tomorrow?

460
00:20:06,066 --> 00:20:07,584
I'd be surprised
if they weren't.

461
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:10,384
I'm wondering.
Can you do me a favor?

462
00:20:10,385 --> 00:20:12,784
Anything for you, Frank.

463
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:42,339
Oh, the blue toothbrush
is yours, right?

464
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,459
Uh, yeah, the blue one.

465
00:20:47,418 --> 00:20:49,458
- Hey, Peter?
- Yeah?

466
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,018
Where do you keep
the light bulbs?

467
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,298
The lamp in the bedroom is out.

468
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,097
In the kitchen, under the sink.

469
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:36,690
Here's what I think.

470
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:38,130
I wish I could be bigger
than this, but I can't,

471
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,809
and I'm being selfish,

472
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,689
and I realize it's mostly
about me, but fuck it.

473
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,449
I have to say it. Please don't
take that other job, Christina.

474
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,648
Anyway, that's how I feel.

475
00:21:57,007 --> 00:21:58,487
I'm glad you told me.

476
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:07,646
Charters jeopardize
our ability to organize,

477
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:09,284
which is reason enough,

478
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,365
but the bigger issue is

479
00:22:10,366 --> 00:22:11,405
that measuring their success--

480
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,925
Charters schools have operated

481
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,084
under the same evaluative
standards that every--

482
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,204
Apples and oranges.

483
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:19,324
No matter how you look at it, you can't
use the same standards to compare.

484
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:22,123
What, you're advocating a more
demanding criteria for charter schools

485
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,002
- than other schools--
- Our point is simple, Frank.

486
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,843
Several funds should only go

487
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,162
- to public union school districts
- Hold on a second.

488
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:31,762
Yeah, but we've already increased
non-charter funding by 10%.

489
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,962
The amount going to charter
schools is negligible.

490
00:22:33,962 --> 00:22:36,481
It's the precedent, Frank,
not the number.

491
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:38,120
We're setting a lot
of precedents, Marty.

492
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:39,881
That's the nature of reform.

493
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, some of them we can stomach.
Some of them we can't.

494
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:44,720
All right, let's not get
bogged down in abstractions.

495
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,999
Let's deal with specifics.

496
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,519
Corey, can you walk us
through it?

497
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,799
There's a three-prong approach

498
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,478
to determining
the amount of funding...

499
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:55,478
Miss me?

500
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,878
Maybe. A little.

501
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,678
What's it been, 15 hours?

502
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,717
Not even long enough
to notice you're gone.

503
00:23:02,718 --> 00:23:04,356
Tell that to Marty Spinella.

504
00:23:04,357 --> 00:23:05,596
How's it coming?

505
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:08,955
It's coming.
Slowly, painfully.

506
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:11,675
Hey, have we always had
tulips in the front yard,

507
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:13,594
or am I slowly going insane?

508
00:23:13,595 --> 00:23:15,155
I planted them last fall.

509
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:16,554
You did not.

510
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:19,074
When I was down with you
for the campaign.

511
00:23:19,075 --> 00:23:21,994
You've never gardened
a day in your life.

512
00:23:21,995 --> 00:23:25,554
Not true. I have gardened
exactly one day in my life.

513
00:23:25,555 --> 00:23:27,073
You were down in Spartanburg

514
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,713
doing some sort of fundraiser.

515
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:31,512
Gene's wife came over
with a bucket of bulbs,

516
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:34,312
and next thing you knew, I was
down on my knees in the dirt,

517
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:35,512
earthworms and all.

518
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,510
I can't even picture it.

519
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:40,951
Neither can I, and I was there.

520
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:42,951
What else?

521
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:45,110
Distract me from giant
peaches and dead teenagers.

522
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:47,030
What else?

523
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:51,269
Oh, I went for a run today,

524
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,229
and the strangest...

525
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,108
I-- I don't know.

526
00:23:58,109 --> 00:23:59,428
This woman...

527
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:04,587
That's interesting.

528
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,707
What is?

529
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,265
Oh, a text just came.
Zoe Barnes.

530
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:09,987
Who?

531
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:13,666
Oh, that reporter from
the herald you met one night.

532
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,984
Oh, her.
I remember.

533
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,546
Yeah, go if you need
to call her back.

534
00:24:16,546 --> 00:24:17,945
No, she can wait.

535
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:19,545
I'm talking to my wife.

536
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:21,465
That's okay.
I'm going to bed soon anyway.

537
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:22,704
See you tomorrow?

538
00:24:22,704 --> 00:24:23,944
I hope so.

539
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,304
Wish me luck.

540
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:31,703
Mm, bonsoir,
my petite Peachoid.

541
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:32,823
Disgusting.

542
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,943
- Good night.
- Good night.

543
00:24:34,944 --> 00:24:37,023
Yeah, all right, that's fine, Corey.
Marty?

544
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:39,381
Frank, let me explain it to you.
Here's our problem.

545
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:50,171
Frank? Frank,
did we lose you?

546
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:51,929
Uh, yeah, I'm here, Marty.

547
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,730
Look, we can talk ourselves in
circles about charter schools,

548
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:56,250
but here's what I propose.

549
00:25:56,251 --> 00:25:58,969
In your profile,
you go into great detail

550
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,528
about the sexism Durant faced
early on in her career.

551
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,649
That's right.

552
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,089
When she was first elected,

553
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,289
it was still an old boy's club
in the senate.

554
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,368
Journalism used to be that
way, too, not so long ago.

555
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,007
I feel really lucky.

556
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:14,366
I've had lots of trailblazers
come before me.

557
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,567
For instance, my colleague
Janine Skorsky

558
00:26:16,568 --> 00:26:18,206
was the first woman
at the herald

559
00:26:18,207 --> 00:26:19,805
to become chief political
correspondent,

560
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:21,125
and that was
only five years ago.

561
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:22,644
Has it been those trailblazers

562
00:26:22,645 --> 00:26:24,285
who've allowed you
to rise so quickly?

563
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:26,245
You've moved up
from the Metro pages

564
00:26:26,246 --> 00:26:28,205
to the front page
Sunday edition.

565
00:26:28,206 --> 00:26:31,684
Uh, well, I don't know
that that would be possible

566
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:34,163
if Janine hadn't already
paved the way.

567
00:26:34,163 --> 00:26:36,963
So does that mean that the herald
is not particularly progressive?

568
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:39,322
I think that they are.
Tom is very open minded.

569
00:26:39,323 --> 00:26:41,162
He's the reason Janine
got promoted.

570
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:43,082
That's Tom Hammerschmidt,
the executive editor.

571
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:45,362
Yes, we actually call him
the hammer.

572
00:26:45,363 --> 00:26:46,681
The hammer? Why?

573
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:47,841
Because he's tough.

574
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,281
How tough?

575
00:26:49,282 --> 00:26:52,361
He's, uh--
Tom has very high standards.

576
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:53,560
I love him.

577
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:55,440
He's a-- he's a great mentor.

578
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,960
Um, it can be frustrating
at times.

579
00:26:57,961 --> 00:27:02,199
Um, he makes you double
and triple-check things,

580
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,159
and you want to get
the news out

581
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,639
the moment you have it,

582
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,719
and he makes you rewrite
until it's perfect,

583
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,838
but that's what makes
the herald the herald.

584
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,556
Is that a workable model
in the Internet age?

585
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:13,838
Our readers think it is.

586
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,278
Well, you have
a declining readership.

587
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,037
But I don't lay that
at Tom's feet.

588
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,757
I think that that's the times
we live in, right?

589
00:27:19,758 --> 00:27:22,556
Should newspapers adapt
to the times we live in?

590
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,395
It's not that the herald
refuses to adapt.

591
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,115
We have an online presence.

592
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:29,515
Is that maybe not adapting
fast enough?

593
00:27:29,516 --> 00:27:31,874
I wouldn't argue
with that statement.

594
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:34,315
We could do more.

595
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,109
We've got a special guest
with us today.

596
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:13,188
He asked for the opportunity

597
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:17,188
to share a few words
with us this morning--

598
00:28:17,189 --> 00:28:20,827
Our very own congressman,
Frank Underwood.

599
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:35,664
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

600
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,144
Thank you, reverend,

601
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:39,303
and thanks to that choir
for that beautiful hymn.

602
00:28:39,304 --> 00:28:43,424
I want to read,
this morning, from...

603
00:28:55,022 --> 00:28:57,982
No.

604
00:28:57,983 --> 00:29:01,420
You know what no one
wants to talk about.

605
00:29:01,421 --> 00:29:02,781
Hate.

606
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,660
I know all about hate.

607
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,979
It starts in your gut,

608
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,139
deep down here,

609
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,379
where it stirs and churns.

610
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,339
And then it rises.

611
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,298
Hate rises fast and volcanic.

612
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:18,497
It erupts hot on the breath.

613
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:20,698
Your eyes go wide with fire.

614
00:29:20,699 --> 00:29:22,337
You clench your teeth so hard

615
00:29:22,337 --> 00:29:24,857
you think they'll shatter.

616
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:29,216
I hate you, God. I hate you!

617
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:35,135
Oh, don't tell me you haven't
said those words before.

618
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:36,095
I know you have.

619
00:29:36,096 --> 00:29:38,895
We all have,

620
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:44,253
if you've ever felt
so crushing a loss.

621
00:29:44,254 --> 00:29:46,813
There are two parents
with us today

622
00:29:46,814 --> 00:29:49,333
who know that pain,

623
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:53,212
the most terrible hurt of all--

624
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:56,091
Losing a child before her time.

625
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:58,372
If Dean and leanne
were to stand up right now

626
00:29:58,373 --> 00:30:00,251
and scream those
awful words of hate,

627
00:30:00,252 --> 00:30:01,611
could we blame them?

628
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:03,331
I couldn't.

629
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:06,010
At least their hatred
I can understand.

630
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:09,050
I can grasp it,

631
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:11,489
but God's wantonness,

632
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,930
his cruelty,

633
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,888
I can't even begin to--

634
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:24,008
My father dropped dead
of a heart attack

635
00:30:24,008 --> 00:30:26,167
at the age of 43--
43 years old--

636
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:28,406
and when he died,
I looked up to God

637
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,927
and I said those words,

638
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,245
because my father was so young,

639
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,886
so full of life,
so full of dreams.

640
00:30:34,887 --> 00:30:38,685
Why would God take him from us?

641
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,285
Truth be told,
I never really knew him

642
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:41,485
or what his dreams were.

643
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,565
He was quiet, timid,
almost invisible.

644
00:30:43,566 --> 00:30:44,844
My mother didn't think
much of him.

645
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,284
My mother's mother hated him.

646
00:30:46,285 --> 00:30:48,563
The man never scratched
the surface of life.

647
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:49,964
Maybe it's best he died
so young.

648
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,963
He wasn't doing much
but taking up space.

649
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:55,083
But that doesn't make for a very
powerful eulogy, now, does it?

650
00:30:55,084 --> 00:30:58,522
I wept.
I screamed, "why, God?

651
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,482
How can I not hate you

652
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:02,842
when you steal from me

653
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:04,802
the person I most love

654
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:07,081
and admire in this world?

655
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,160
I don't understand it,
and I hate you for it."

656
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,279
The Bible says

657
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,879
in proverbs,

658
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,918
"Trust in the Lord
with all your heart

659
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,117
and lean not on
your own understanding."

660
00:31:28,118 --> 00:31:31,597
Lean not on your
own understanding.

661
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,237
God is telling us to trust him,

662
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:37,076
to love him despite
our own ignorance.

663
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:41,075
After all, what is faith

664
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:44,515
if it doesn't endure
when we are tested the most?

665
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:51,554
We will never understand

666
00:31:51,555 --> 00:31:53,833
why God took Jessica

667
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,113
or my father or anyone.

668
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:58,952
And while God may not
give us any answers,

669
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:03,192
he has given us
the capacity for love.

670
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:06,151
Our job is to love him

671
00:32:06,152 --> 00:32:09,311
without questioning his plan.

672
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:12,951
So I pray to you, dear Lord,

673
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:14,149
I pray to you

674
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,949
to help strengthen
our love for your

675
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,470
and to embrace Dean and leanne

676
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,269
with the warmth of your love
in return.

677
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,228
And I pray that you will
help us fend off hatred

678
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:32,627
so that we may all truly
trust in you

679
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:34,627
with all our hearts

680
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:38,867
and lean not on
our own understanding.

681
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:41,386
Amen.

682
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:42,906
Amen.

683
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:45,306
Your job is to report
the news, not be the news.

684
00:32:45,307 --> 00:32:46,385
I was promoting the paper.

685
00:32:46,386 --> 00:32:48,025
You were promoting Zoe Barnes.

686
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:50,105
Is this about how I said
we called you the hammer?

687
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:52,224
- Because if that upset you, I apologize.
- You're missing the point.

688
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:55,064
I don't want you talking about
anything that happens here,

689
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:57,263
not nicknames,
not how progressive we are,

690
00:32:57,264 --> 00:32:59,183
not whether we are adapting
to the Internet.

691
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,903
Any thoughts you have
about this paper,

692
00:33:00,904 --> 00:33:02,663
you keep them to yourself,
or you bring them to me.

693
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,062
You don't get on national
television and sp--

694
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:05,582
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to--

695
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,781
Don't interrupt
when I'm talking.

696
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,861
You can speak to me
like an adult, Tom.

697
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,701
You don't have to lecture me
like a little girl.

698
00:33:11,702 --> 00:33:15,061
You haven't earned the right
to be treated as an adult.

699
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,420
You think a few front-page
stories and some face time on TV

700
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:19,419
makes you the next Judy Miller?

701
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,500
You've got a long way to go.

702
00:33:20,501 --> 00:33:22,420
Don't be so arrogant.

703
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:26,739
Okay, so you think when a woman
asks to be treated with respect,

704
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,138
that's arrogance?

705
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,378
Are you accusing me of sexism?

706
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,018
Just making an observation.

707
00:33:32,019 --> 00:33:33,697
No TV for a month.

708
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:35,137
- What?
- You heard me.

709
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,657
No interviews.

710
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:37,977
That's completely unfair.

711
00:33:37,978 --> 00:33:40,097
You want to make it
no TV indefinitely?

712
00:33:42,136 --> 00:33:44,816
We're done.
You can go now.

713
00:34:07,252 --> 00:34:09,812
Hello?

714
00:34:09,813 --> 00:34:12,652
Gillian, it's Claire Underwood.
Can I come up?

715
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,010
Have you seen a doctor?

716
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:25,969
Giardia's not so bad.

717
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,328
It'll pass in another
week or so.

718
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:30,529
You don't have
health insurance, do you?

719
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,568
Nope.

720
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:35,087
I'll make an appointment for you
to see my personal GP tomorrow.

721
00:34:35,088 --> 00:34:36,768
Medicine doesn't
really do much.

722
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,688
You have to let it run
its course.

723
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:41,247
Well, we'll let it run its
course under proper supervision.

724
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,086
I won't take no
for an answer on this.

725
00:34:43,087 --> 00:34:44,327
- Claire--
- I'll drag you to the hospital myself

726
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:45,645
if I have to.

727
00:34:45,646 --> 00:34:48,006
You're going to the doctor.
No argument.

728
00:34:49,845 --> 00:34:51,686
Thanks.

729
00:34:51,686 --> 00:34:54,086
They're about to walk.
They won't listen to a word I say.

730
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,685
- Both unions?
- Yeah.

731
00:34:55,686 --> 00:34:56,925
Put Marty on the phone.

732
00:34:56,926 --> 00:34:57,964
Hang on.

733
00:34:57,965 --> 00:34:59,364
Marty.

734
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:02,564
Yeah. It's Frank?

735
00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:06,203
This isn't working, Frank.

736
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,762
Marty, you have got to keep
them in that room.

737
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:10,203
They lost their patience.

738
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:12,042
They're upset you're not
in the room, Frank.

739
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,162
- I'll be back this afternoon.
- No, it's too late.

740
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:18,681
Look, tell them I'll come down on
subsidies for charter schools.

741
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,081
Even so,

742
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:21,601
they're angry about
the performance standards.

743
00:35:21,602 --> 00:35:22,920
We're not even halfway
through this thing.

744
00:35:22,921 --> 00:35:24,680
There's so much in it
that they--

745
00:35:24,681 --> 00:35:26,480
Tell them that I'll roll over
on performance standards,

746
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:28,919
five-year intervals.

747
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,360
It should be you
telling them that, Frank,

748
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:33,638
you here, at this table.

749
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:35,598
I know that.
I'm doing the best I can,

750
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,438
but I can't be
in two places at once.

751
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,758
Now, look.
I promise you,

752
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:41,198
if you keep them in that room,

753
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:42,797
we will get through this hump

754
00:35:42,798 --> 00:35:45,637
as soon as I get back.

755
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:48,716
Marty, you are their lobbyist.
You know what's best for them.

756
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,996
Save them from themselves.

757
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:54,035
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

758
00:35:57,236 --> 00:35:58,475
Stamper.

759
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:00,714
Do not let Spinella
out of your sight

760
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:03,234
and lock the goddamn doors
if you have to.

761
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,994
You got it.

762
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,313
Here we go.

763
00:36:08,314 --> 00:36:09,993
I know you're a busy man.
I hope we're not keeping you.

764
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:11,913
No, no, no, I've got all
the time in the world.

765
00:36:11,914 --> 00:36:14,393
This is ham
and these are turkey.

766
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,473
And there's some potato salad.

767
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:18,592
Shall we have a prayer?

768
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,951
Gracious loving God...

769
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:21,471
Have you had this before?

770
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:24,191
This is the third time.
I'm used to it by now.

771
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,510
Well, I'm not used to it,
but it beats malaria.

772
00:36:26,511 --> 00:36:28,030
You've had malaria.

773
00:36:28,031 --> 00:36:29,111
In Zimbabwe.

774
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:30,510
That took me out for a month.

775
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:33,750
You make a lot of sacrifices.

776
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,509
I don't see it as a sacrifice.

777
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,669
You turned down
a six-figure salary at Google

778
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,669
to start your own non-profit.

779
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,068
People don't get malaria
in Palo Alto.

780
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:46,547
You do your research.

781
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:50,906
When it's someone I care about.

782
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:54,866
Claire, I turned down that job
because I would've hated myself.

783
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:56,866
It was a lot of money,
but for what?

784
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:58,666
So they could fulfill
their diversity quota

785
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:01,345
with an Asian girl
peddling a Stanford degree?

786
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,505
Not just any Asian girl.

787
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:04,944
A valedictorian.

788
00:37:04,945 --> 00:37:07,984
Let me offer you
what Google couldn't.

789
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:09,304
I know what it is

790
00:37:09,304 --> 00:37:12,183
to be capable and beautiful
and ambitious

791
00:37:12,184 --> 00:37:14,663
and be on people like Sergey
and Larry's checklist

792
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,342
of things that look good
to have on a shelf.

793
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,181
I'm not trying
to acquisition you.

794
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:25,661
What I see in you
is a woman I admire,

795
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,021
which doesn't happen often.

796
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:30,260
I want to enable you.

797
00:37:30,261 --> 00:37:32,180
I want to clear the way for you

798
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:34,619
so that you can achieve
what you want to achieve,

799
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,980
on your own terms.

800
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,219
Thanks for the tea.

801
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,538
And I will send a car to pick
you up for the doctor tomorrow.

802
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:45,938
When you're back on your feet,

803
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,017
do you think maybe we can work
something out?

804
00:37:53,057 --> 00:37:55,137
Yes, I think we could.

805
00:37:57,816 --> 00:37:59,695
That's her at junior prom.

806
00:38:01,455 --> 00:38:02,856
Beautiful.

807
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:09,133
Here she is
in her letter jacket.

808
00:38:09,134 --> 00:38:13,173
She made varsity as a freshman.

809
00:38:13,174 --> 00:38:15,053
I remember the day
she found out.

810
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,573
Coach called.

811
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:19,212
Jessie starts jumping
up and down.

812
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,611
"Mom, guess what?"

813
00:38:26,812 --> 00:38:27,932
I'm sorry.

814
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:30,091
Don't be.
It's fine.

815
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:32,411
Why are we doing this?

816
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,650
Honestly, what's to be gained

817
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:37,770
in dredging up all this stuff?

818
00:38:37,771 --> 00:38:39,369
Remembering the good things
helps sometimes--

819
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,690
Not when it puts my wife
in tears.

820
00:38:43,048 --> 00:38:44,369
I appreciate what you said
at the church,

821
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,768
but it doesn't do us any good.

822
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,208
Neither does this.

823
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:48,647
Well, what can I do to help?

824
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:50,208
You can't do anything.

825
00:38:50,209 --> 00:38:51,808
She's gone.

826
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:54,767
You're right.
I can't change that,

827
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,486
but I can make sure

828
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:59,487
the city offers you
a sizable settlement.

829
00:38:59,488 --> 00:39:01,086
You mean buy us off?

830
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,765
No, I mean help you avoiding
years of court battles.

831
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:06,486
Jessica was going
to go to Furman.

832
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:08,565
Is that right?
On a volleyball scholarship?

833
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:10,365
Yes, a full ride.

834
00:39:10,366 --> 00:39:12,804
Well, I spoke to the president
of the university this morning,

835
00:39:12,805 --> 00:39:14,524
and we'd like to create
a new scholarship

836
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:15,604
in your daughter's name.

837
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:16,844
If you'd like that.

838
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:18,004
It's entirely up to you.

839
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:19,964
But, most importantly,

840
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:22,043
we have to make sure
that this never happens again.

841
00:39:22,044 --> 00:39:25,002
We've got safety billboards
going up,

842
00:39:25,003 --> 00:39:26,402
we're going to stop lighting
the tower at night,

843
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:28,041
and we're putting
the guard rails in.

844
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,442
Should've done all that
before she ran off the road.

845
00:39:31,443 --> 00:39:34,560
Would you like me to resign,
Mr. masters?

846
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:37,640
Just say the word,
and it's done.

847
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,960
If it will bring you
any satisfaction.

848
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:51,718
I asked the reverend once,

849
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,398
"What are we supposed to do

850
00:39:53,399 --> 00:39:56,558
in the face
of so much senseless pain?"

851
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:58,437
And he said to me,

852
00:39:58,438 --> 00:40:00,357
"what else can we do

853
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:02,677
but take what seems meaningless

854
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:06,476
and try to make something
meaningful from it."

855
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:08,115
He's right.

856
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,555
That's how God works--

857
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:13,475
Through us.

858
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:16,354
Will you let me work for you?

859
00:40:22,513 --> 00:40:24,553
What you have to understand
about my people

860
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:26,353
is that they are
a noble people.

861
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:28,952
Humility is their form
of pride.

862
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:32,072
It is their strength,
it is their weakness,

863
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:36,231
and if you can humble
yourself before them,

864
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:38,671
they will do anything you ask.

865
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,190
Tell us more
about the scholarship.

866
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:10,625
- Hey.
- Hey.

867
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,906
What are you doing?

868
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:13,745
- Working.
- On what?

869
00:41:13,746 --> 00:41:16,464
The, uh, BRAC commission stuff.

870
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:18,424
I'm behind on it.

871
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,504
It's Sunday.

872
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:22,424
So?

873
00:41:22,425 --> 00:41:24,943
You don't usually work
on the weekend.

874
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,543
Well, now I do.

875
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:29,063
There's, uh, coffee in the kitchen.
You want some?

876
00:41:32,302 --> 00:41:33,702
Peter...

877
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:37,621
Peter.

878
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:40,861
If I decide to stay,

879
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:43,180
it's because it's what I want,
not what you want.

880
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,299
I understand.

881
00:41:52,778 --> 00:41:55,018
Which draft are you reading
of the written testimony?

882
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:56,298
The one you sent on Thursday.

883
00:41:56,299 --> 00:41:58,537
I actually changed it
on Friday.

884
00:41:58,538 --> 00:41:59,978
Can I show you?

885
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:05,416
Yeah, I was thinking that we
could start with job numbers

886
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,257
and then go to
economic multipliers

887
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,296
instead of
the other way around.

888
00:42:08,297 --> 00:42:09,896
What do you think?

889
00:42:09,897 --> 00:42:12,216
Let's see what it looks like.

890
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:31,172
Picture this--

891
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,452
A 17-year-old girl

892
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:34,012
traveling at 60 miles an hour

893
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:36,132
spins out of control
in no traffic.

894
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:37,372
She hits a guard rail.

895
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:39,572
But if she's wearing
her seatbelt,

896
00:42:39,573 --> 00:42:40,851
which she was,

897
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:42,131
and her car doesn't roll
over three times

898
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:44,291
down a 20-foot ditch,
which it did,

899
00:42:44,292 --> 00:42:46,210
then that young woman
is still alive.

900
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:48,930
But you know what?

901
00:42:48,931 --> 00:42:51,770
The county administrator
didn't build those guard rails,

902
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,370
so now she's dead.

903
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:55,009
We looked up the statute.

904
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,969
Guard rails are under
county supervision.

905
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:01,968
Are you trying to turn this
around on me?

906
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:03,007
That's not all, Orrin.

907
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:04,528
Your easement.

908
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:06,727
You see, every couple of years
the piedmont electric,

909
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:08,887
they apply to bring power lines
through Gaffney.

910
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:10,526
The route comes
right through your lot.

911
00:43:10,527 --> 00:43:12,007
Now, gene and I
always fight them off,

912
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:14,326
but this year, if they
were to reapply, hmm...

913
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:15,726
Eminent domain.

914
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,166
It would be such a shame
to have to tear down

915
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:18,166
this beautiful home.

916
00:43:18,166 --> 00:43:20,165
Fuck you, Frank.

917
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,966
You can't just roll up
on my property

918
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,164
and act like you own it.

919
00:43:28,724 --> 00:43:30,164
Oh, but I can.

920
00:43:30,165 --> 00:43:31,484
We just did.

921
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:37,123
I've won this district
11 times.

922
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:40,083
Do you think that's just luck
and a firm handshake?

923
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:42,882
But I'll tell you what.
I'm not a vindictive person.

924
00:43:42,883 --> 00:43:45,441
I don't like for anybody
to lose if everybody can win,

925
00:43:45,442 --> 00:43:47,681
so I'm going to help you
get elected in the fourth.

926
00:43:47,682 --> 00:43:49,601
You get to keep your house.
I keep the fifth.

927
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:52,241
We put the Peachoid behind us,
and everybody's happy.

928
00:43:52,242 --> 00:43:54,120
What do you say?

929
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:55,440
Well, that's all right.
You think about it.

930
00:43:55,441 --> 00:43:57,399
I'm sure you'll do
the right thing.

931
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,279
Oh, and I'm looking forward to
having you in congress, Orrin.

932
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,239
It's always good to have friends
on the other side of the aisle.

933
00:44:23,155 --> 00:44:25,435
I've been offered a spot
on Nightline.

934
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:27,514
You want my advice?

935
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:29,354
I don't want it.
I need it.

936
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:30,915
Close your eyes.

937
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:34,274
Okay.

938
00:44:34,275 --> 00:44:37,514
It's 11:25.
Nightline is about to come on.

939
00:44:37,515 --> 00:44:39,553
Millions of people
are watching.

940
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:40,952
Where are you, home?

941
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:42,832
No.

942
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,192
At the studio?

943
00:44:44,193 --> 00:44:45,591
Yes.

944
00:44:45,592 --> 00:44:47,112
And what do you see?

945
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:48,951
I see lights.

946
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,152
I see a camera.

947
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:52,230
And that little red dot
goes on.

948
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,471
Tell me what you hear?

949
00:44:54,472 --> 00:44:56,069
I hear my voice.

950
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,070
And those millions of people,
what do they hear?

951
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,949
My voice.

952
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,549
And what do they see?

953
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,590
My face.

954
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,188
So you don't need my advice.

955
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:09,988
Hammerschmidt's going to freak.

956
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:11,507
You don't want to work anywhere

957
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,547
you're not willing to get
fired from, Zoe.

958
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:17,067
Treading water's the same as
drowning for people like you and me.

959
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:18,386
Good luck.
I'll be watching.

960
00:45:18,387 --> 00:45:20,027
- Hey, wait.
- Yes?

961
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:21,146
When do you get back?

962
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:24,386
When I get back, you'll know.

963
00:45:27,905 --> 00:45:29,905
Hello, Nancy.

964
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:32,185
Welcome back, sir.
Linda Vasquez called for you.

965
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:33,704
Tell her I'll call her in a
couple hours with an update.

966
00:45:33,705 --> 00:45:35,224
- Very well.
- Sir?

967
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:38,423
Unless you need anything,
Kyle has you covered.

968
00:45:38,424 --> 00:45:40,103
No, go home.

969
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,463
You did well this weekend.

970
00:45:41,464 --> 00:45:42,903
Thank you, sir.

971
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:45,623
Oh, and before you go home,
can you do me a favor?

972
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:46,822
Would you swing by my house

973
00:45:46,823 --> 00:45:48,542
and make sure these get
to Claire?

974
00:45:48,543 --> 00:45:50,021
Yes, sir.

975
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:52,301
And thank you, sir,
for being so patient.

976
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:00,379
Okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
