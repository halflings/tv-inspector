1
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,990
Hey, excuse me. I'm Paul Capra.
I'm here to see Christina.

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,675
Oh, right this way, Mr. Capra,
she's expecting you.

3
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,200
Paul. Hey, Christina.

4
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,430
Hi.

5
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,795
It's good to see you.
Yeah, you too.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,910
Can I get you anything?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,593
No, I grabbed some
breakfast on the way down.

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,955
Okay, have a seat.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,711
I asked you down here because I
spoke to D-trip and the DNC.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
We'd like you to
run for Peter's seat.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,472
As you probably know,
the election

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,518
has been set for the
first week of February.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,676
You want me to run?

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,799
With your stature
in the community,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,601
your grass-roots
organizing experience...

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,034
Christina, hold on...

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,474
I know it's a lot to consider.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,876
It's only been a month.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,073
We still have to govern, Paul.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,879
I thought you
asked me down here

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,753
because you wanted
to talk or something.

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,718
I do, about the election.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,916
I mean about Peter.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,750
How come you didn't
go to the funeral?

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,876
I couldn't.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,633
How you been holding up?

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,353
I'm all right.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,120
It's been hard keeping
the office on track.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,833
Jesus. Screw the office.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,475
What about you?

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,756
You're allowed to grieve,
Christina.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,195
Paul,

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,115
there are 600,000
people counting on us.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,239
I can't let my feelings
get in the way of that.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,515
Will you hear me out about
running for Peter's seat?

36
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,112
Well, you've passed the vetting
process with flying colors.

37
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,470
Is there anything
we might have missed?

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,716
No, sir.

39
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,993
Tell me about your
experience as the Chair

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,839
of the Oversight
and Reform Committee.

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,071
It's been very rewarding.

42
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,880
What are the biggest
challenges you've had to face?

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,111
Partisanship.

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,112
Well, I suppose a room
filled with 435 big egos

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,954
isn't the most hospitable
place for oversight.

46
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,389
Do you want to be
Vice President, Tabitha?

47
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,440
It would be a great honor, sir.

48
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,754
We'll be in touch.

49
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,797
That's all? For the time being.

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,872
Thank you, Mr. President.

51
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,913
We have to cross her off.
I agree.

52
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
She could put
a crack addict to sleep.

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,637
Then what is she doing
on the goddamn list?

54
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,712
Tabitha's a very
gifted legislator.

55
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,871
I don't want people who
make sense on paper.

56
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,077
I need at least
one viable option.

57
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,836
The two of you've
created this list,

58
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,389
and have proceeded to cross off
every name you've put on it.

59
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,470
It's just a first pass, sir.

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,994
We need time to
fully vet all...

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,480
Jim is going to win this
thing in Pennsylvania.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,361
And we're no closer to naming his
replacement than we were a month ago.

63
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,159
Let us take
another crack at it,

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,999
and give you a few
more names to consider.

65
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
I just want one name.

66
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,360
We'll have something for
you by tomorrow morning.

67
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,357
Thank you, Mr. President.

68
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,917
He's ready to say
yes to anything.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,593
Yeah, for this to work, I
don't think you can be there.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,836
Not when I first
mention it.
I agree.

71
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,195
You bring it up in
your morning brief

72
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,595
and when I show up,
I'll act surprised.

73
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,160
Assuming he's open to the idea.

74
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,277
Look, all we have to do tomorrow
is plant the notion in his head.

75
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,919
I'm sure you'll be persuasive.

76
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,356
<i>Hello?</i>

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,397
<i>Mr. Capra? Yeah. Who's this?</i>

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,312
<i>Janine Skorsky from Slugline.</i>

79
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,959
We spoke when I wrote the piece

80
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,639
about Congressman
Russo's passing.

81
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,116
<i>I'm done giving interviews
about Peter, okay?</i>

82
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,760
<i>He was a troubled
guy, end of story.</i>

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,479
This is not about his death.

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm calling you because my sources
at the DCCC are telling me

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,472
that you might be
running for his seat.

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,710
<i>I'm not talking about that.</i>

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,553
But you did have
a meeting this morning

88
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,478
with Christina Gallagher,
correct?

89
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,792
<i>I'm driving right now. I really
shouldn't be on the phone.</i>

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,718
If you do run,

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,951
I would like to know
about your involvement

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,356
in the closing of the
Philadelphia Shipyard.

93
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,351
<i>That decision was
made in Washington.</i>

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,756
<i>The Association
wasn't consulted.</i>

95
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,915
Forgive me,
I find that hard to believe.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,471
I read all of the transcripts
from the BRAC Commission.

97
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,115
Congressman Russo didn't
give any testimony.

98
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,272
So are you saying that he didn't
consult with you once before he...

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,750
<i>Somebody was strong-arming him, okay?
It was politics.</i>

100
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,355
Do you know who would
have pressured him?

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,358
<i>I don't know. He just said
people up the food chain.</i>

102
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,437
Did he say anything
more specific about...

103
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,876
<i>You know what? There's traffic.
I gotta go.</i>

104
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,792
Mr. Capra, I would love to...

105
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,519
Should I be prepared
to do press?

106
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,120
If he's amenable.

107
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,677
What do you think
our chances are?

108
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,994
Better than 50-50,
if I had to say.

109
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,392
We won't announce until after
Matthews wins, though.

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,920
I hate to admit it,
but I'm nervous...

111
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,356
So am I.

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,199
It's just that last time
we found ourselves...

113
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,993
That's my fear, too.

114
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,955
All right.
You call me,
either way?

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,917
In no more than nine hours.

116
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,471
Linda's been in
there far too long.

117
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,314
If the President takes this much
convincing, it doesn't bode well.

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,235
I can feel it, his hesitation,
on the other side of that door.

119
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,592
I know it's pointless to worry until
I know what cards I'm holding.

120
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,712
Perhaps he just got
interrupted by some...

121
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,233
He wants to tap Raymond Tusk.

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,150
What?

123
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,072
He thinks it's a bold idea.

124
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,355
That's an idiotic idea.

125
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,669
The man's never
held public office.

126
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,673
That's one of the things the
President said he likes about him.

127
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,433
The President wants to nominate

128
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,280
a multi-billionaire in
a struggling economy?

129
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,640
He'll alienate
half the country.

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,870
Which is exactly
what I said to him,

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,754
but he made it very clear he does
not want me to fight him on this.

132
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,394
So you didn't
mention me at all?

133
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,516
I never had the chance.

134
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,831
His mind was made up
before I could say a word.

135
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,394
Well, we have to un-make it.

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,437
Well, you can try,
but if you do,

137
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,194
my guess is he's gonna cut you
out of the process altogether.

138
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,919
He seemed adamant.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,559
We should go in there.

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,998
Mr. President. Morning, Frank.

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,031
Will you give us
a few minutes, Linda?

142
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,114
Of course.

143
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,793
Linda fill you in?

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,480
I think Raymond Tusk...

145
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,479
Is an exciting, bold idea.

146
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,438
Well, I'm glad you agree.
Linda didn't think so.

147
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,910
He's a proven businessman,
brilliant but down-to-earth.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,354
Do you know him personally?

149
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
I met him briefly
once at a fundraiser.

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,436
Last night when
I called him was

151
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,153
the first time we had a
meaningful conversation.

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,277
Did he seem open to the idea?

153
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,875
I sensed a good
deal of reluctance.

154
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,519
He wanted a few
days to consider.

155
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,512
Well, good, that gives us
time to start vetting him.

156
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,920
He's clean.

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,593
I had him vetted last year

158
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,275
when I was considering him for
Secretary of the Treasury.

159
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,431
And did he say
why he's reluctant?

160
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,080
No, didn't give a reason.
Just wanted to mull it over.

161
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,360
I want to send someone to St.
Louis to speak to him person,

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,233
convince him to accept
the nomination.

163
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,436
Who are you thinking about?

164
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,711
I'd send Linda, but there's so
much work for her to do here.

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,871
And she can be
abrasive at times.

166
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,276
Yeah, she can be a bit tough.

167
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,313
I want someone with,
uh, gravitas.

168
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,796
Birch is a possibility, but he's not
always been our strongest ally.

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,078
I'm not sure I would trust Bob
with something like this.

170
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,520
I would be happy
to go myself, sir.

171
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,031
I can use a light touch, and give
him the respect he deserves.

172
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,440
Good. I'll let his people
know you're coming.

173
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
Thank you, Mr. President.

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,756
Thank you, Frank.

175
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,475
<i>Tell me, Francis.</i>

176
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,711
It's good we were
prepared for anything.

177
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,997
I have to fly to
St. Louis tonight.

178
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,674
"Somebody was strong-arming
him." And when I asked him who,

179
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,638
he said, quote,
people up the food chain.

180
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,710
It's Washington.

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,235
Congressmen get
strong-armed all the time.

182
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,915
My gut says it
was Frank Underwood.

183
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,515
He had nothing to do with Russo
before the shipyard closing,

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,716
and then suddenly
he's propping him up...

185
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,956
That doesn't mean he was...

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,919
Let's cut the bullshit
once and for all, Zoe.

187
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,958
I know he's been
feeding you your stories.

188
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,080
I don't want to screw you over,

189
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,880
but I'm not going to
stop digging on this.

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,515
I won't say he was a source.

191
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,193
But you do know each other.

192
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,076
Show me your notes
and I'll talk to him.

193
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,114
These are the notes
from the Capra call.

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,636
And these are the transcripts
from the BRAC hearing.

195
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,509
When they get to the Philadelphia
Shipyard, Russo doesn't say anything.

196
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,514
That's fine.

197
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,633
Yeah, I would just put
both of them in that file.

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,674
Claire, I just got a call
from the PR office at SanCorp

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,359
saying they wanted
to send a film crew

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
to take footage of our
filtration project in Botswana.

201
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,196
Right. They're just using that
for promotional material.

202
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,077
SanCorp fought us on
the Watershed Bill.

203
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,875
They helped us get the
filters out of South Sudan.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,561
I thought that was
the State Department.

205
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,796
No. You remember Remy Danton?

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,798
You met him in your office right
after you started working here?

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,992
The lobbyist.
I asked him
for his help.

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,840
We're just returning the favor.
That's all.

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,390
Claire, they're against
everything we stand for.

210
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,875
It's harmless.

211
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,156
They'll send the video to
a few of their investors,

212
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,435
and make some commercials.

213
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,398
This makes me very uncomfortable.
The idea...

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,273
They are sending
the film crew, Gillian.

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,193
So please work
with them on that.

216
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,958
One of my colleagues is
looking into Peter Russo.

217
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,790
The assumption is you strong-armed
him into closing the shipyard.

218
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,351
Where does your colleague
get their information?

219
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,954
I don't know.

220
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,719
Allocating the DoD budget
is always a free-for-all.

221
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,274
Did you pressure him?

222
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,999
There were certain people
that were gonna benefit

223
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,799
from the base closing
sooner rather than later.

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,075
I didn't strong-arm Peter,

225
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,597
I advised him to trade in a
losing hand for a winning one.

226
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,473
How did he stand to win?

227
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,634
He made allies out of enemies. That's
a very valuable thing in Congress.

228
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,473
I wish I could give
you something juicier,

229
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,439
but the shipyard closing was
just politics as usual.

230
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,558
I assume your colleague
is Ms. Skorsky.

231
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,555
She know we're talking?

232
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,949
No, of course not.

233
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
Be in touch.

234
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,990
More than you ever wanted to
know about Raymond Alan Tusk.

235
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,198
Companies he controls,
political contributions,

236
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,397
<i>a GQ article entitled
"Backwoods Billionaire"</i>

237
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,711
is about his humble
mid-western lifestyle.

238
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,075
Jesus.

239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,396
There's also a copy of the
financial disclosure requirements

240
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,119
and details of the blind trust.

241
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,874
I think the trust is
where you want to focus.

242
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,440
Could Linda be behind all this?

243
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,960
To what end?

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,550
To get you out of
town for a few days

245
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,757
while they continue the search
without your interference?

246
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,957
The President has no
reason to mistrust me.

247
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,515
Unless Linda told him you
want the Vice Presidency.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,954
No, she's in way too deep.

249
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,157
We misjudged her on the Secretary
of State nomination...

250
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,230
That was different.

251
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,755
She blindsided me. Now she
knows my eyes are wide open.

252
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,552
Do you want the Gaffney
bag or regular business?

253
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,750
Regular business.

254
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,241
Tusk can dress
down if he wants to,

255
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,600
but I'm representing
the White House.

256
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,313
And get Walter Doyle onto Tusk.

257
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,113
Let's see if we
can dig up anything.

258
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,714
I'll call him right now.

259
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,200
And keep your eye on Janine
Skorsky while I'm away.

260
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,033
She's been prying into Russo.

261
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,110
What does she know?

262
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,759
She knows the right
questions to ask.

263
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,832
I want to make sure she doesn't
get the right answers.

264
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,910
I'm on it.

265
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,439
McCuddin.

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,034
McCuddin.

267
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,399
What was that?

268
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,034
McCuddin Air Force Base.

269
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,680
BRAC hearing was
there on April 12.

270
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,157
David Rasmussen stepped down
less than a week later.

271
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,509
Womack takes his place.
So maybe...

272
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,994
So wait... Slow down.

273
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,513
McCuddin is in his district.

274
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,154
Is that the shipyard thing?

275
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,714
Janine, call me back. I think it
was Womack who pressured Russo.

276
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,033
Russo was probably just earning
a favor he could cash in later.

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,834
I'm around.

278
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,277
Did you ever have to fight
her to kill a story?

279
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,312
Janine?
Yeah, when she worked for you.

280
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,640
Only when I knew she was wrong.

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,913
She's trying to draw up
this whole conspiracy thing

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,516
with Russo and Frank Underwood
and the whole shipyard closing.

283
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,193
But I'm pretty
sure she's wrong.

284
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,913
Pretty sure isn't
the same as certain.

285
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,394
No, I am certain.

286
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,834
How do you know?
I have sources.

287
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,720
Underwood? No.

288
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,952
No, never mind.
I'll figure it out.

289
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,997
Mrs. Tusk? Jean, please.

290
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,037
You must be Frank. Come in.

291
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,920
So nice to meet you.

292
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,951
The guest room is this way.

293
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,879
It is very kind of you to
have invited me to stay here.

294
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,794
Why waste the taxpayers'
money on a hotel

295
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,071
when we have
a perfectly good bed?

296
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,914
Well, both they and
I are very grateful.

297
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,672
I'm sorry Raymond isn't awake to
greet you, he goes to bed at...

298
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,992
I know, he's an early riser.
I understand.

299
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,390
Would you like a wake-up knock?

300
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,870
No, I have an alarm
on my phone.

301
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,430
Sleep tight.

302
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,716
Thank you so much.

303
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,471
I would say good morning, but
it's the middle of the night.

304
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,998
It's a pleasure to meet you.
And you, too.

305
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,558
Was I making too much noise?

306
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,592
No, I smelled bacon.

307
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,310
Here.

308
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,397
Coffee? Booze? 2:00 a.m.
you can go either way.

309
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,000
Just water for now.

310
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,872
It's filtered.
Your wife would approve.

311
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,513
You ever been
to St. Louis before?

312
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,790
Just the airport.

313
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,314
What do you think so far?

314
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,039
Well, I've only
seen your neighborhood

315
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,112
and whatever I could see out
the window on the interstate.

316
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,032
Good enough. It's all
pretty much the same.

317
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,196
Excuse me.

318
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,350
Listen, I still
haven't showered.

319
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,796
My mind is on China here.

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,311
What do you say you
get a few more z's

321
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,631
and we try this again in a few
hours with our clothes on?

322
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,119
Sounds like a plan.

323
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,432
Meet me at my office at 9:30.
I'll have a driver pick you up.

324
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,594
Can I ask why you do that?

325
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,991
Do what?
Tap your ring
like that.

326
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,560
I've seen you do it on TV.

327
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,156
Two taps every time you get up
from a table or leave a lectern.

328
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,118
Something my father taught me.

329
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,953
It's meant to
harden your knuckles so

330
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,840
you don't break them if
you get into a fight.

331
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,435
It also has the added benefit
of knocking on wood.

332
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,237
My father believed that success

333
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,317
is a mixture of
preparation and luck.

334
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
Tapping the table kills
both birds with one stone.

335
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,430
Your father was a peach farmer?

336
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,632
Yes, he was.
Not a very successful one.

337
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,996
Lack of preparation
or lack of luck?

338
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,070
Lack of both.

339
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,800
He was better at giving
advice than following it.

340
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,870
Hmm.

341
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,320
Miss, your card.

342
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Thank you.

343
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,954
Ms. Gallagher,

344
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,396
<i>my name's Janine Skorsky,
I'm a reporter at Slugline.</i>

345
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,755
I wrote the profile
on Congressman...

346
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,109
I remember.

347
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,350
Do you have a minute?

348
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,439
If this is about Peter, I...

349
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,233
No. It's about Paul Capra.

350
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,754
We know that he
might be running

351
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,360
for Congressman
Russo's old seat.

352
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,596
I can't comment on that.

353
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,513
We're just trying
to do some background

354
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,279
on the shipyard
closing last April.

355
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,670
Listen, I just want
to eat my breakfast...

356
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,520
We have sources that are saying

357
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,592
that the Congressman
was being pressured

358
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,752
by someone to not
fight the closure.

359
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,189
Who?

360
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,913
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

361
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,195
This is completely off the
record, I promise you.

362
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,270
Hi, Christina.

363
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,390
Doug, hi.

364
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,713
How you holding up?

365
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,553
I'm okay. I'm good.

366
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,075
I saw you sitting over
here, you mind if I?

367
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,469
No, please.

368
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,993
Ms. Skorsky, right?

369
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,841
<i>I believe we spoke a few times when
you used to work for The Herald...</i>

370
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,834
Whenever I could get past the
press office gauntlet to you.

371
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,240
We do like to run a tight ship.

372
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,350
Hmm.

373
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,881
So what brings
you to the Capitol?

374
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,200
I was just asking Ms. Gallagher

375
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,795
who's running to fill the vacant
seat in Pennsylvania's 1st.

376
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,915
Well, the honest answer
is we don't know.

377
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,869
Thank you for your time,
Ms. Gallagher.

378
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,032
Anyone starts harassing
you with questions

379
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,072
you don't want to answer,
you let me know.

380
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,475
I'll handle them.

381
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,280
You got enough on
your plate right now.

382
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,634
Thanks, Doug.
I appreciate that.

383
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,112
Hang in there, okay?

384
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,790
Yes.

385
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,670
Ah!

386
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,912
Uganda, Peru,

387
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,633
Nepal, Indonesia,

388
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,154
Nicaragua.

389
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,154
Well, you are quite
the well-traveled man.

390
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,556
No. I'm the man
who stays at home.

391
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,990
Jean brought those back for me.

392
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,312
Mr. Tusk, I am... First names.

393
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,995
After all, we have
broken bacon together,

394
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,755
we can safely assume
that we're familiar.

395
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,389
Raymond, I realize that
you are a very busy man,

396
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,597
so I'm gonna cut
right to the chase.

397
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,598
The President sincerely
would like you

398
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,632
to become
the next Vice President.

399
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,234
That part I already knew.

400
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,672
And I'm here to
convince you to say yes.

401
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,672
Another thing I already knew.

402
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,473
Well, I don't know
that I can tell you

403
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,319
anything you
don't already know.

404
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,120
But perhaps you can tell me
what your hesitation is.

405
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,350
Speak.

406
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,429
Yes.

407
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,996
Now, I understand you
might have some concerns

408
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,720
about the financial
disclosures leading...

409
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,036
Speak.

410
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,195
No.

411
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,714
I have eight people
representing me

412
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,352
at eight simultaneous meetings
in six time zones right now.

413
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,591
I sit here and
answer their questions,

414
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,550
provided they come in the form of
a single yes or no proposition.

415
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,799
Well, then let me
give that a try.

416
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,554
Would you like to be the
Vice President, yes or no?

417
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,160
Hold on a minute.

418
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,118
I am very sorry.

419
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,591
Let me have 20 minutes to
wrap up these meetings.

420
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,554
And then what do you say
we get out of the office

421
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,711
and away from this damn phone?

422
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,196
Meet me at my car. Betty can
tell you where it's parked.

423
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,510
Go ahead.

424
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
He's deflecting.

425
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,277
What I can't tell is whether it's
because he's inclined to say no

426
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,670
or wants to be
wooed to say yes.

427
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,479
Either way I'll
have to ease him into

428
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,353
the conversation,
not be so blunt.

429
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,109
This trip may take
longer than I thought.

430
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,550
We've looked through
all the file cabinets.

431
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,639
They're not on his computer?

432
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,838
Not with the Congressman's
handwritten notes.

433
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,430
All right.
I'll check his office.

434
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,110
Ah!

435
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,475
There's a comfort
to these woods,

436
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,552
like they're my backyard.

437
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,358
Well, they are my backyard in a way.
I own them.

438
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,074
How much land?

439
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,674
6,000 acres.

440
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,995
You think I could get a tour of your
Fulton Plant while I'm in town?

441
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,600
If you like,

442
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,193
but I don't know why you'd want

443
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,913
to be there when you
could be out here.

444
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,032
I've never seen
a nuclear plant.

445
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,759
Not much to see.

446
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,476
Steel, concrete, lot of steam.

447
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,873
The President
hasn't exactly been

448
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,593
a big supporter
of nuclear power.

449
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,996
Is that part of
your hesitation,

450
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,476
that fear that
the Administration...

451
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,637
He's just being savvy.

452
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,399
Nuclear energy is a
tough sell after Japan.

453
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,359
But it's the only
option we have right now

454
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,359
that doesn't completely
trash the planet.

455
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,955
The argument against nuclear
power is an emotional one.

456
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,840
And you don't make decisions
based on emotion.

457
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,511
Decisions based on emotion
aren't decisions at all.

458
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,236
Instincts.

459
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,996
Which can be of value.

460
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,471
The rational and the irrational
complement each other.

461
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,759
Individually,
they're far
less powerful.

462
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,873
And which category
do your thoughts

463
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,753
on the Vice Presidency
fall into?

464
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,990
You hear that song?

465
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,119
It's a hermit thrush.

466
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,279
Can't see him.

467
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,837
"Solitary, the thrush,

468
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,995
"The hermit,
withdrawn to himself,

469
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,557
"avoiding the settlements,

470
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,356
"Sings by himself a song."

471
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,510
Do you know the poem?

472
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,671
No, I don't. Walt Whitman.

473
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,237
It's about the death of Abraham Lincoln.
He's over there, somewhere.

474
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,591
Yes, I know the damn poem. We
studied it at the Sentinel.

475
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,275
I said to my professor, "Why
mourn the death of presidents,

476
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,556
"or anyone for that matter?
The dead can't hear us."

477
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,117
And he asked if I believed in heaven.
I said no.

478
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,760
And then he asked if I
had no faith in God.

479
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,672
I said you have it wrong.

480
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,070
It's God that
has no faith in us.

481
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,993
Deeper into the woods.

482
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,800
I think you're being paranoid.

483
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,918
He came up right after I sat down.
It was creepy.

484
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,554
I'm telling you, it was Womack.

485
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,870
Is that what Underwood said?

486
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,440
He didn't name names,
but who else?

487
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,880
And what's the big deal?
Congressmen trade favors.

488
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,714
One of these congressmen
committed suicide.

489
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,360
I think you're
stretching here, Janine.

490
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,510
To try and connect...

491
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,710
I have gone after
big fish before.

492
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,712
I know what it feels
like to be watched.

493
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,959
Underwood's Education Bill went
to the floor just three days

494
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,753
after Womack
became Majority Leader.

495
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,799
You leaked the Education Bill. And
then there was the Kern article.

496
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,360
Those were two completely
different stories...

497
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,716
Wait, what was the guy?
What was his name?

498
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,393
He's the one who
told that Kern wrote

499
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,193
the article for
the school paper?

500
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,555
Roy Kapeniak.

501
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,909
You should go talk to him.

502
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,229
There's no link.

503
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,629
Except you.

504
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:50,036
Underwood's been using you, Zoe.
Don't you want to know why?

505
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,636
Hi.

506
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,876
<i>Remy Danton's on line two.</i>

507
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,952
<i>He says it's important.</i>

508
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,439
<i>Hello, Remy. Hey, Claire.</i>

509
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,314
<i>I got a call from the
PR team at SanCorp.</i>

510
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,471
<i>They said Gillian Cole
isn't being cooperative.</i>

511
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,871
Hasn't gotten back
to them, you mean?

512
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,278
<i>No, told them point blank she
doesn't want the film crew there.</i>

513
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,555
<i>I'm looking at an email.</i>

514
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,201
<i>She wrote that they
would be "disruptive</i>

515
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,919
<i>"to the project and
local community."</i>

516
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,354
<i>Is that her, or is
that coming from you?</i>

517
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,757
No, I made it very clear that I
wanted her to work with them.

518
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,032
<i>Well, it seems like she's
doing the opposite.</i>

519
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,478
I will speak to her.

520
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,315
And then I'll sort things out
with the PR team personally.

521
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,397
<i>Thank you, Claire. You bet.</i>

522
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,119
Is Gillian at lunch?

523
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,715
She didn't come in yet today.
She's not feeling well.

524
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,993
Let me know when she gets here.

525
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,231
What time is your flight? 6:40.

526
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,993
We should get going.
There's gonna be traffic.

527
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,554
Almost ready.

528
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,233
I've been thinking,

529
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,149
the, uh, older man you were
with, was it Underwood?

530
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,751
So what this is really about
is covering your own ass?

531
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,436
That is not true.

532
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,398
You don't want anybody to know
you were sleeping with him.

533
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,352
Not exactly objective
reporting, is it?

534
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,114
Don't fucking lecture me
on journalistic ethics.

535
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,793
<i>How many of the stories you
brought me at The Herald</i>

536
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,870
were because you were...

537
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:32,996
I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

538
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,355
Fine. Maybe you should
take a cab to the airport.

539
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,760
Don't punish me
for being honest.

540
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,995
You haven't been honest.

541
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,037
I had to ask. And you still haven't
given me a straight answer.

542
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,190
Yes.

543
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,915
It was him.

544
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,510
I...

545
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,920
I don't know if I can do this, Zoe.
Do what?

546
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,997
You fucked a congressman
to get ahead.

547
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm not the first person to ever
do something like that, Lucas.

548
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,194
But I'm not sleeping with
those other people, am I?

549
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,509
What, so you just hate me now?

550
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,671
No, I probably love you.
That's the fucking problem.

551
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,755
Let's go, I'm parked illegally.

552
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,317
So I hear you went stomping
through the woods today.

553
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,671
We did, and then
Raymond was kind enough

554
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,951
to arrange a tour
of the Fulton Plant.

555
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,157
I'm sure you were wondering,

556
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,153
"When is this old fool gonna
get around to brass tacks?"

557
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,398
I'm here to simply
answer questions.

558
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,075
I figured that you would make
up your mind when you're ready.

559
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,752
There are two minds here.

560
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,355
We know all about
the blind trust.

561
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,519
Does it concern either of you?

562
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,430
The words "blind" and
"trust" are not among

563
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,956
my favorites in
the English language.

564
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,229
But I have no
problem with it in theory.

565
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,074
Not managing our
assets for a few years

566
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,277
could unburden us from a
great deal of stress.

567
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,156
Well, then what does your
reluctance stem from?

568
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,237
Why do you think
the President wants me?

569
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,789
Well, I can't speak on his
behalf, but if I were to...

570
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,473
Aren't you here
to do just that?

571
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,280
Speak on his behalf?

572
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,954
If I were to speculate, I
think the President would...

573
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,236
Speculation is
a poor form of investment,

574
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,596
and an equally
poor form of politics.

575
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,034
Tell me what you know.

576
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,640
I don't know what you mean.

577
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,716
Well, what do you
think I should do?

578
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,710
You personally,
Frank Underwood?

579
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,995
My opinion isn't
what matters here.

580
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,310
It does to me.

581
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,472
Should I do it? Yes or no?

582
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,874
Well, there's a great number of
things to consider, Raymond...

583
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,437
And I'm sure you've considered them all.
Yes or no, Frank?

584
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,152
No, I will not
answer that question.

585
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,152
Because you think I shouldn't.

586
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,913
Because it's not relevant.

587
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
All right, then, let me
ask you another way.

588
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,349
Would you take the job?

589
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,954
It hasn't been offered to me.

590
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,076
What if it were?

591
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,272
I have a distaste
for hypotheticals

592
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,511
just the same as you have a
distaste for speculation.

593
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,754
All right, all right.

594
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,274
That's enough business for now.

595
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,834
We can discuss
it more tomorrow.

596
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
Get in there, Bruce.

597
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,680
Sorry. Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
I'm looking for Roy Kapeniak.

598
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,280
I thought his trailer was over here.
Am I in the right place?

599
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,036
You're in the right place a month ago.
He got evicted.

600
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,800
Shooting off his gun
too much in the yard.

601
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,559
Do you know
where I can find him?

602
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,676
Why?

603
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,594
I'm a relative. His niece.

604
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,194
Skipped town is what I heard.

605
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,034
Had a girl living with him.
Maybe she knows.

606
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,279
Name was Echo. Echo?

607
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,752
What she went by, at least.

608
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,600
Works at the titty bar
over on 40.

609
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,319
Highway 40? Mmm-hmm.

610
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,079
Across from the Burger King.

611
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,469
Okay. Thank you.

612
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,920
Girls get in free.

613
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,116
I'm looking for Echo.

614
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,554
Who? Echo?

615
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,632
Roy was a fucking wacko. I was stupid
to live with him as long as I did.

616
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,160
Do you know where he is now?

617
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,634
I don't know and I don't care.

618
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,992
He ever talk about
the article I wrote?

619
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,197
All the time. He had it framed.

620
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,519
Bet it's still in the trailer, if
it's not in a junkyard by now.

621
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,675
Did he say why he called me?
Did he ever tell you?

622
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,240
I was there.

623
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,510
Where?

624
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,756
When the guy showed up.

625
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,830
Who?

626
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,674
I won't name names.

627
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,230
Fuck Roy Kapeniak.
You don't owe him shit.

628
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,113
Some guy who said
he was a congressman.

629
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,351
Was it him?

630
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,998
No, he was younger.

631
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,431
Tall. Not much hair.
Pretty good-looking.

632
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,000
Yeah, that was him.

633
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,355
You're absolutely sure?

634
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,239
He brought bourbon, blow,
stayed the whole night.

635
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,480
The whole thing was his idea.

636
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,029
What, to say that Kern
wrote the editorial?

637
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,755
That guy didn't write anything.
It was all Roy.

638
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,111
Okay, I know I said that
I wouldn't name names.

639
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,072
And I won't,
if that's what you want.

640
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,998
But you could be
famous overnight.

641
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,230
Talk shows, TV,
the whole country...

642
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,476
No way.

643
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,961
You wouldn't have
to dance anymore.

644
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
You could do
whatever you want...

645
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,113
Don't use my
fucking name, okay?

646
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,959
I already said more
than I should have.

647
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,996
Stamper, it's midnight.

648
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,156
<i>Two things, boss.</i>

649
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,352
First, Janine Skorsky ambushed
Christina this morning.

650
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,194
<i>I intercepted her before
she could ask too much.</i>

651
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,396
Should we be worried?

652
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,915
I can keep this contained, sir.
I just wanted you to know.

653
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,599
All right.
What's the other thing?

654
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,434
Doyle came back with his research.
I just emailed it to you.

655
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,750
<i>The President told you he and Tusk
didn't know each other, right?</i>

656
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,636
Yeah, he said they met once,
I think at a fundraiser.

657
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,752
<i>That would appear to be a lie.</i>

658
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,601
All right, I have it
in front of me now.

659
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,677
Doyle cataloged all the
instances he could find

660
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,150
in which the two of them were in
the same city at the same time.

661
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,630
<i>Items in red are events
that they both attended.</i>

662
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,480
<i>And he found something else.</i>

663
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,799
Back in Walker's
private sector days

664
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,559
he was the CEO of
Pioneer Airlines.

665
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,796
<i>Guess who owned a third of the
stock when it was sold to United?</i>

666
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,829
Raymond Tusk.

667
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,754
My guess is that he and Walker
know each other quite well.

668
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,839
All right, let me look this over.
I'll call you back.

669
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,593
I'm being played.

670
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,954
But why?

671
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,756
Did I wake you again?

672
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,830
No.

673
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,434
I'd like to talk.

674
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,440
Give me a moment.

675
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,673
Carolina Parakeet?

676
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,359
You're wrong, but you're close.

677
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,191
This is the Sun Conure.

678
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,069
They look very similar, but the
Carolina Parakeet is extinct.

679
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,072
Was killed off because it
was considered a pest.

680
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,072
Interesting species, though.

681
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,231
Voracious appetite.

682
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,353
And he was poison.
Cats who ate him died.

683
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,957
This bird is not
the only thing you've

684
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,197
misidentified since
you've been in St. Louis.

685
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,349
You and Walker are old friends.
I wasn't sent here to vet you.

686
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,756
Very good.

687
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,718
Tell me why I am here, then.

688
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,479
So I can vet you.

689
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,909
For the Vice Presidency?

690
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,511
The President values my advice,

691
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,557
and he tends to follow it.

692
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,475
Like when I advised him not to
make you Secretary of State.

693
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,075
That was very bad advice.

694
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,600
Yes, it was.

695
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,434
One of the larger
mistakes I've made,

696
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,359
and I rarely make
mistakes of any size.

697
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,151
You've proven yourself
to be quite difficult.

698
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,910
Kern, the teachers'
strike, now Matthews...

699
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,396
You attribute all that to me?

700
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,359
If I had to guess.

701
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,636
A smart man once
said to me that

702
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,877
speculation is
a poor form of politics.

703
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,761
Why don't you stick to
what you know, Raymond?

704
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:32,752
What I know is you are extremely
effective at what you set your mind to.

705
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,791
That is valuable to me,

706
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,873
and I've already told Garrett
that it could be valuable to him.

707
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,313
Somebody at his side with one
foot in the Executive Branch

708
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,959
and one in the Legislative.

709
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,629
He is very open to the idea.

710
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,078
My turn to speculate.

711
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,270
Your recommendation
comes at a price.

712
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,870
Fact.

713
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,674
I have something that you want,

714
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,599
you have something that I want.

715
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,559
Have I said something amusing?

716
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,917
I've just sat too many times
on your side of the table

717
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,038
not to enjoy the irony of finding
myself on this side of it.

718
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,272
Would you like to
hear what I want?

719
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,676
I don't shackle myself
to people I don't know.

720
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,200
What I want is one favor.

721
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,873
One and only one.

722
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,270
Which is?

723
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,511
I need to be certain
you'll grant it before

724
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,871
I'll take the risk of
being more specific.

725
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,720
A blank check.

726
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,274
Of sorts.

727
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,159
You would never grant
anyone a blank check.

728
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,276
No.

729
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,591
But I'm not sitting on
that side of the table.

730
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,032
We still believe in
handshakes where I come from.

731
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,560
Do they still mean anything in Washington?
Who are you calling?

732
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,353
Car service to get
me to the airport.

733
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,153
Frank.

734
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,794
I will tell the President
that I want until Friday

735
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,236
to think things over before
I make my recommendation.

736
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,993
Let me know if you
change your mind.

737
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,793
And let me arrange
the car for you.

738
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,276
Hi, I'd like to
arrange a car, please.

739
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,236
How are you feeling?

740
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,516
Better than yesterday.

741
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,752
But I might take off early
if the nausea comes back.

742
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,997
I find it interesting
that you stay home

743
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,197
the day after you blow
off the SanCorp people.

744
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,075
You weren't
feeling sick,
Gillian.

745
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,351
I find it extremely
offensive that you'd

746
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,517
accuse me of hiding
behind my pregnancy.

747
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,918
You knew what I wanted.

748
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,514
The Botswana project is mine.

749
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,399
Under my umbrella.
Using money I raised.

750
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,800
You promised me autonomy.

751
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,389
Um, excuse us
for a moment, please.

752
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,233
I promised to empower you.

753
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,277
That's not the same
thing as you doing

754
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,272
as you choose
without consulting me.

755
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,840
I'm not going to
allow a project

756
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,274
I've put almost three
years of my life into...

757
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,432
Your project wouldn't be happening
if it weren't for SanCorp.

758
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,201
I didn't ask for their help.

759
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,709
How about consulting me
before you struck a deal?

760
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,197
Let's get something very
clear, I run the organization.

761
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,919
You work for it.

762
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,720
Our agreement is
an affiliation, Claire.

763
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,961
WorldWell isn't your vassal.

764
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,116
Yes, it is.

765
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,755
Entirely. If we're going
to be blunt about it.

766
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,354
That's not what you
proposed six months ago.

767
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:30,318
It's what you signed up for
when you signed the contract.

768
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,711
There was a good faith
understanding that...

769
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,235
And you've dissolved that
good faith by disobeying me.

770
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,560
Disobeying you?

771
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,630
Yes.

772
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,669
I threaten you, don't I?

773
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,917
Nothing about you threatens me.

774
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,400
But maybe you should
take a leave of absence.

775
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,553
Are you firing me?

776
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,080
That's up to you. But right
now, you should leave.

777
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,073
Did you get her on record?

778
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,839
No. She wouldn't
talk to me otherwise.

779
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,833
Well, we need hard proof that
Underwood was behind it.

780
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,355
This whole thing is
making me really nervous.

781
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,193
That you'll be exposed?

782
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,829
Not that.

783
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,633
It's Francis.

784
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,281
If this really goes
as deep as we think,

785
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,874
and he's already
watching you...

786
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,280
You think he's dangerous?

787
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,510
I know he is.

788
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,959
Then that's why we
have to keep going.

789
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,440
He crushes people, Janine.

790
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,079
Hey, Callum. Hey.

791
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,272
Look, if you weren't afraid, you
wouldn't be doing your job.

792
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,591
The only articles
that I have ever written

793
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,996
that truly mattered scared
the shit out of me.

794
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,676
We need to know about anything
that might've happened with Russo.

795
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,514
Something Underwood could
have held over him.

796
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,916
We have to go back to
Christina Gallagher,

797
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,240
see if she'll
give us something.

798
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,549
It can't be me.

799
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,512
If I go back for a second time...
I'll do it.

800
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,870
You honestly had no idea that the
President and Tusk were close?

801
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,310
<i>He never showed up once on
any call sheet, phone log</i>

802
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,393
<i>or schedule during the campaign
or since we've been in office.</i>

803
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,834
I'd love to believe you, Linda,

804
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,241
but I'm finding
it very difficult.

805
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,192
<i>What would I gain by
keeping you in the dark?</i>

806
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,680
<i>I am as shocked
as you are, Frank.</i>

807
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,796
Well, don't let on
that you know.

808
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,956
<i>Of course not.</i>

809
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,759
What's the President saying?

810
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,991
<i>He wants to meet with you Tuesday
to get your report on Tusk.</i>

811
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,150
That's a farce.

812
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,511
<i>Should I come up with a
reason to delay the meeting?</i>

813
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,557
No, maybe we'll learn something.
What time?

814
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,994
<i>2:00 p.m.</i>

815
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,800
All right, I'll be there.
Thank you, Linda.

816
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,080
We have one week.

817
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,600
To accomplish what exactly?

818
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,120
To force Tusk's hand.

819
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,157
He wants me
beholden to him? No.

820
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,272
We have to make him to
come crawling to me.

821
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,679
What's his weakness?

822
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,840
His fortune.

823
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,360
Wouldn't you say
that's his strength?

824
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,954
Not if it's slipping away.

825
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,873
How do you make $40 billion
disappear overnight?

826
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,360
We can't,
but maybe we can create

827
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,874
the illusion
that it's in danger.

828
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,713
The brief you gave
me on his assets,

829
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,636
how much of his total net
worth is in nuclear power?

830
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,070
About a third.

831
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,311
Sixteen reactors here in
the States, 37 worldwide.

832
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,881
Well, that's what
we hit him with.

833
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,281
We go after his
nuclear interests.

834
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,119
Even so, he's got $25 billion
in other investments...

835
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,237
Doug, this is a man who built
his fortune from nothing.

836
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,558
The money doesn't mean anything to him.
It's what it represents.

837
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,596
Which is what?

838
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,875
His life's work.

839
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,476
Get Remy Danton on the phone. Set
up a meeting as quickly as you can.

840
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,712
Tusk understands the difference
between power and money.

841
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,197
That's precisely what
makes him dangerous.

842
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,194
He doesn't measure his wealth in
private jets, but purchased souls.

843
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,632
I've worked too hard to get
within arm's reach of the prize

844
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:47,350
only to have my hand cut off
just before I seize it.

845
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,395
Zoe Barnes, here to see
Christina Gallagher.

846
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm sorry,
I don't see
an appointment.

847
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,751
Oh, there must be a mistake.
I have an 11:30.

848
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,194
One second.

849
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,433
<i>My name is Zoe Barnes,
I work at Slugline.</i>

850
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,273
You spoke to my colleague,
Janine Skorsky.

851
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,350
Miss.

852
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,430
We're fine, thanks.

853
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,600
You can't just come in here...

854
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,592
There are things you
don't know about Peter.

855
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,393
I wrote the article
about Roy Kapeniak...

856
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,318
Please leave. Right now.

857
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
It was Peter who convinced
him to talk to me.

858
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,636
What? I don't understand...
Why would he...

859
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,552
Somebody pressured
him to do it.

860
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,989
The night of January 24. That's
when he went to speak to Kapeniak.

861
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,998
Do you remember
anything strange

862
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,833
around the time of
the inauguration?

863
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,554
Anything that could have
been held over him?

864
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,915
No, I don't.

865
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,753
If he was mixed
up in things that

866
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,513
in any way
contributed
to his suicide,

867
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:40,875
wouldn't you want to know?

868
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm not trying to cause
you any more pain.

869
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,999
I just want the truth.

870
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,637
And you deserve
that more than anyone.

871
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,436
What was the date?

872
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,510
The 24th of January.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
