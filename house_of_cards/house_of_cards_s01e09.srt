1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,754
When the enemy attacked, you ran away.
That's treason.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,674
Now it's time to splatter
your brains everywhere.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,116
Please! Please, don't kill me!

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,993
Shut up! Die like a man!

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,673
But I have a wife and family.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,154
That's what happens to cowards.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,357
Hey. You have to keep it down.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,920
There's an important
meeting going on.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,390
Sorry.

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,119
I'll set you up
in the copy room.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,237
You won't be in the way there.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,630
This is gonna be a close vote.
Most of your colleagues

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,554
are not gonna want to spend this
amount of money in just 25 districts.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,359
Try persuasion first.

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,715
Talking points
are in your packets.

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,237
And if you want more detailed
information, research, statistics,

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,118
you can contact
Gillian or myself.

18
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,197
And when it comes to doling
out favors, talk to Doug.

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,193
If favors don't work, come
to me directly. Peter.

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,680
I'll be campaigning
in Pennsylvania.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,872
All my events this week will be
in counties within the watershed,

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,155
so I'll be working
the media angle.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,311
But if you need me to get
on the phone with anybody,

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,073
reach out to Christina. She'll
work it into my schedule.

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,676
I have to say, Frank, $200 million
is going to be a hard sell.

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,229
The natural gas lobby's already
putting up a big fight.

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,720
We need to make
this about jobs.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,395
But the drilling industry can offer
far more jobs than this bill can.

29
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,800
This bill doesn't
threaten those jobs,

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,713
it just makes sure the
drilling is done responsibly.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,393
It adds more jobs
on top of that.

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,597
I've already been approached by
SanCorp with re-election funds.

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
I have too. They offered
me a donation package

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,073
from eight different
drilling companies.

35
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,879
Remy Danton? Yep.

36
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,879
How many of you been
approached by Remy?

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
Look, I know it's not
easy to turn down money.

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,831
But if the Republicans control
redistricting in Pennsylvania,

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,673
we lose the House
next election,

40
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,434
and all of you lose your
committee chairmanships.

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,352
This is a feather that
we need in Peter's hat.

42
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,599
A loss on this bill endangers
his chance of winning,

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,434
and we are fighting to
keep our majority here.

44
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,840
Any other concerns?

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,030
I want a first vote count
by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

46
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,032
Thank you all very much.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,240
It's brutal. Twenty-two
stops in three days.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,880
It's a lot of sleeping on the bus.
No sleeping.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,801
That bus is the only place
I can get work done.

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,833
You know, Francis did a
big bus tour in 1998,

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,152
and the bus lost its
brakes going down a hill

52
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,674
and we landed in
a tobacco field.

53
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,231
He gets out of the car,
knocks on the farmer's door,

54
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,158
writes a check for
all the damaged crops,

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,557
and then borrows his pickup so
he doesn't miss the next event.

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,160
And it was actually fun.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,517
He was driving. I was shotgun, and they
had the whole staff in the flatbed.

58
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,040
We actually got
there 10 minutes early.

59
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,396
I think I should be here
to help drum up votes.

60
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,960
Careful, sir. It's very hot.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,110
Look, you and
the Vice President

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,276
are gonna get
national coverage.

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,919
That's gonna help us
with the count.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,801
I reached out to him. He
never got back to me.

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,957
I don't know if he even knows the
talking points about the bill.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
I don't think Jim wants to go.

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,113
He's doing it as a favor
to the President and I,

68
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,197
so it doesn't matter if he
doesn't know the talking points.

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,397
People wanna see him
be folksy, you know?

70
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,910
So just humor him. Show
him some degree of...

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,520
Oh, my God.

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
Are you okay?
It was an accident.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,277
Okay, it's time for us to go.
I'm so sorry.

74
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,194
It's all right. I just need to
run it under some cold water.

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,998
I'm not going to lie.
I despise children.

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,554
There. I've said it.

77
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,632
You can't act
like that in here.

78
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,393
You have to be
a big boy.
I know.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,949
Peter, we really
need to get going.

80
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,271
We've already missed one flight
because the meeting went over.

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,033
I booked us another
one at 9:25, but...

82
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,680
We have to drop
the kids off at school.

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,920
It's going to be really tight.

84
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,161
If we miss this plane, we have
to cancel our first event.

85
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,073
Nancy, can you take them?

86
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,959
I've gotta get packets ready
for the lunchtime subcaucuses.

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,790
Peter, I'd do it, but we have a meeting
with Greenpeace in 20 minutes.

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
I gotta get their
rating on the bill.

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,675
Where's their school?

90
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,110
Connecticut and Q.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,112
Oh, I can take them. You sure?

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,353
Yes. It's on the way
to my office.

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,796
This Watershed Act
proves that once again

94
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,159
the anti-capitalist agenda is alive
and well in the Democratic party.

95
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,391
Let me show you
what's really going on.

96
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,310
Here are the Democrats eating
up all of their soft science,

97
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,631
"organically
homegrown" propaganda

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,315
that the eco-fanatics
are force-feeding them.

99
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,359
And over here, at the tail-end
of all those jackasses,

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,312
are middle-class Americans.

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,074
People who just
want to work hard

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,073
and rely on jobs in
the drilling industry.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,991
And what about
the hypocrisy, folks?

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,117
Does Peter Russo
honestly have the gall

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,277
to lecture us on
the purity of our rivers,

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,155
when he has been polluting himself
with chemicals for years?

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,957
He's not just been eating
grass, he's been smoking it.

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,509
It's the only major bill
he's sponsored in six years.

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,160
I know, but they already have national coverage.
What's the angle?

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,276
If it doesn't pass,

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,676
I think he'll lose support from
the Shipbuilders' Association.

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,831
So they lose support.
It's not that juicy.

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,429
They're a huge part of his
get-out-the-vote effort in Philly.

114
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,199
It sounds like inside baseball.

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,509
Not if I get the vote count.

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,478
Black and white numbers.
Nobody has that.

117
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,917
But when I called the campaign,
they stone-walled me.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
Same thing at
the Whip's office.

119
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,270
Do you know anyone over there?
In Underwood's office?

120
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
No, I don't.

121
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,234
Nobody on staff?

122
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,595
Mm-mmm. Oh.

123
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,480
I just figured because you
gave me the Russo profile.

124
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,800
No, that didn't come from them.

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,036
But Underwood
organized the campaign.

126
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,794
I'm sorry.
I don't know
anybody there.

127
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,633
Okay.

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,791
Hey, it's me. I just wanted
to fill you in on something.

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,918
I should be back home at 10:00.
Meet me there.

130
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,073
- Sarah made
this one.
- It's a frog.

131
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,152
And I made this one. Can
you guess what it is?

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,390
A lobster?

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,190
No. It's a scorpion. They're for you.
For the ones you gave us.

134
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,272
Oh, they're beautiful.

135
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,559
But maybe you should bring
them to school, no?

136
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,394
For show-and-tell? Or give
them to your friends.

137
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,200
No. The other kids will
just make fun of us.

138
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,994
Why?

139
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,470
Everybody hates us at school.

140
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,600
They say Dad's a crackhead
and that we're crack babies.

141
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,151
I looked up "crack baby" on the computer.
I don't look like that.

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,312
You know, they say Dad's
gonna OD like Amy Winehouse.

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, you tell them
that your dad

144
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,596
doesn't do that kind of
thing anymore, right?

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
Yeah, we do,
but they don't believe us.

146
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,831
Did you try going
to the teachers?

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,719
We can't do that. Everyone
would just hate us even more.

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,872
Well, you can't worry about
what other people think, right?

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,710
I wish Dad wasn't
running for governor.

150
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,518
You ever been to Allentown before?
I have not.

151
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,920
What do you think?

152
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,680
Compared to New York,
the parking is easier.

153
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,956
Finding a decent bagel,
not so much.

154
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,594
We'd make up for it
with the cream cheese.

155
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,313
Shall we? Ready when you are.

156
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,436
Your Watershed Bill.

157
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,115
You've ticked off the
Republicans, oil, gas...

158
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,998
Sometimes you gotta upset a few
people to do the right thing.

159
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,470
Not just a few. There's
a sizable coalition

160
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,279
that wants to
see your bill fail,

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,431
including environmentalists
from your own party

162
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,510
who don't think
the bill does enough.

163
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,640
We wanted a passable bill.

164
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,074
That's why we aimed
for a middle ground...

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,159
Do you actually care about
the Delaware River?

166
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,913
I don't sponsor legislation
I don't care about.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,595
Until recently, you hadn't
sponsored any legislation at all.

168
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,955
I spent my time in Congress

169
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,281
focusing on things that were
important to my constituents.

170
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,430
The shipyard.

171
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,875
Kept it open
as long as I could.

172
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,475
Okay. That's one thing.
What are the others?

173
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,995
I'd love to
provide you a list of

174
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,673
all the things
I've done in Congress,

175
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,841
but we've got 15 minutes...

176
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,639
Your opponent has
linked your inactivity

177
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,558
to your fondness
for single-malts.

178
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,552
I've been very
open about my past,

179
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,632
and I've done everything
I can to overcome it

180
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,717
in a responsible,
permanent way.

181
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,914
And I preferred
vodka to scotch.

182
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,520
You should get
your facts straight.

183
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,757
Is your Watershed Act just a
ploy to jump into the spotlight

184
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,958
and pad your transcript while
you apply for governor school?

185
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,754
It's real money.
It's real jobs.

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,391
And when the Delaware River is less
polluted than it's been in 50 years,

187
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,030
it's holding up a real glass of its
water and seeing how clear it is.

188
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,560
That's what my
bus tour is about.

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,519
The Vice President is
joining you later? Correct.

190
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,792
Why has it taken him this
long to endorse you?

191
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,598
He didn't think I was worth it.

192
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,231
<i>But then he heard I had a
one-on-one with The New York Times,</i>

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,551
and, boom, he was on board.

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,074
I might print that.

195
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,150
The more of my words,
the fewer of yours,

196
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,230
the better off we'll both be.

197
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,438
If I didn't think you were such a
liability to yourself, Congressman,

198
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,319
I might even like you.

199
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,153
<i>If your circulation was as high
as The Wall Street Journal,</i>

200
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,356
I might like you back.

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,832
Hit me. Next question.

202
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,756
<i>I have to
put up a fight, Frank.</i>

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,320
Tell them they're
wasting their money.

204
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,113
It's gonna pass. Are you sure?

205
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,676
When was the last time
I got a count wrong?

206
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,911
If you were certain, you wouldn't
be trying to neutralize us.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,559
Well, SanCorp has been
good to me.

208
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,597
I'm just trying to do you
and them a favor, Remy.

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,399
Then why propose the legislation
in the first place?

210
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,630
You must've known
they would oppose it.

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,598
The regulatory
restrictions are minimal.

212
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
There's a bigger
battle here, Frank.

213
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,398
SanCorp is against any
step toward regulation,

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,596
no matter how small.

215
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,841
Russo's planted his feet on
the wrong side of the fence.

216
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,838
How much are you
giving his opponent?

217
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,912
Check the FEC filings.

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,514
How much are you
actually giving?

219
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,792
It's a $10 billion industry, Frank.
There's money to spend.

220
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,112
If the Democrats lose Pennsylvania,
you know what that means.

221
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,475
We don't want you
to lose leadership,

222
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,755
but that's up to you, not us.

223
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,475
You don't have the same kind of
relationship with the Republicans

224
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,438
that you have with me.

225
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,950
Then we'll adapt.

226
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,479
We both have votes
to count. Good luck.

227
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,077
You tell SanCorp
they're being foolish.

228
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,429
I'm not gonna do that.

229
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,079
Well, then,
you're being foolish.

230
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,393
Come on, Frank. Let's
not make this personal.

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,750
I can't compete with
SanCorp's war chest.

232
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,599
My only option is asymmetrical.

233
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,674
To pick off the opposition one by
one like a sniper in the woods.

234
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,833
There will come a time to
put Remy in my crosshairs,

235
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,479
but not right now.

236
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,319
As we used to say in Gaffney,

237
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,995
"Never slap a man while
he's chewing tobacco."

238
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,190
Congressman, how are you?

239
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,192
I deeply appreciate you taking
the time out of your schedule...

240
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,919
Hank, I need to eat.

241
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,875
See if you can rustle up a
club sandwich, extra bacon.

242
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,120
Fuck me.

243
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,910
Ta-da.

244
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,998
Thai cuisine again.

245
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,552
The green curry is for you, and
the other green curry is for me.

246
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,074
I was actually
just on my way out.

247
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,958
I bought you dinner.
You have to eat it.

248
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Or at the very least, you
have to watch me eat mine.

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,520
I'm gonna be late
to meet someone.

250
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,637
Who? Like, a date?

251
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
A friend.

252
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,080
The mysterious fuck-buddy who you
get all of your stories from?

253
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,560
Lighten up. I was just teasing.

254
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,390
Not that I would judge.
We've all done it.

255
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,390
I used to suck, screw and jerk anything
that moved just to get a story.

256
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,632
Really? Like who?

257
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,990
You want dish?

258
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,276
No. It's just...

259
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,591
The Comm Director on Ben
Schroeder's Senate race.

260
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,871
A staffer in
the Defense Department.

261
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,872
My very own White House intern.

262
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,351
He was a real blabbermouth when
he wasn't eating me out. Wow.

263
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,876
And I even had a fling
with a Congressman.

264
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,189
Which one?

265
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,193
You tell me yours,
and I'll tell you mine.

266
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,509
I've never been with any.

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,319
Oh, come on. You're hot.

268
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,313
You're telling me that none
of them have come on to you?

269
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,119
I haven't really
been in those circles.

270
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,793
You are now.

271
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,520
I guess I don't really
give off that vibe.

272
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,512
You mean the slut vibe?

273
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,513
Look, I don't
do that shit anymore.

274
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,479
'Cause once word got out,
it was like I hit a wall,

275
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,313
and nobody took me seriously.

276
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,030
So, a piece of advice, as far
as career strategies go,

277
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,119
it's not worth fucking
your way to the middle.

278
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,192
Chopsticks or fork?

279
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,950
Look, if you go, I am gonna
have to eat both of these,

280
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,235
and that is not cool.

281
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,390
No. I'll eat with you.

282
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,590
Good.

283
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,510
<i>Things have gotten underway
in Eastern Pennsylvania</i>

284
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,236
<i>for the governor's seat left vacant
there by Vice President Jim Matthews.</i>

285
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,472
<i>After a political career that
has lasted 42 years so far,</i>

286
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,439
<i>the genial Vice President and the
former Pennsylvania Governor,</i>

287
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,876
<i>faces the most critical task
of his new electoral life</i>

288
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,636
<i>helping his home state fill the vacancy
of his departure from Washington.</i>

289
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,439
<i>However, Matthews
seems reluctant</i>

290
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,353
<i>to hand over the spotlight
to Peter Russo.</i>

291
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,315
Back home, Meechum.

292
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,110
Sir.

293
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,999
Francis...

294
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,953
How's your hand?

295
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,190
Fine.

296
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,520
You should change
the bandage, no?
Later.

297
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,400
I thought you were
gonna be out late.

298
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,800
No.

299
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,278
You seem upset. I'm not.

300
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,477
What happened? Nothing.

301
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,634
Can I get more than
two words out of you?

302
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,032
I'm just trying to relax.

303
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,472
Claire, I love you.

304
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,439
I love you too.

305
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,597
Did Zoe expect me to twiddle
my thumbs until her arrival?

306
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,831
Perhaps she's
making the mistake

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,077
thinking her time
is as valuable as mine.

308
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,551
Proximity to power deludes some
into believing they wield it.

309
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,997
I put an end to that sort of
thinking before it begins.

310
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,391
<i>And if I'm not mistaken, the
last time I was in Tannersville,</i>

311
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,119
<i>Buddy Corcharan pulled me aside</i>

312
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,879
<i>and told me I was
wasting my time,</i>

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,358
<i>because the Republicans were gonna
sweep Monroe County in a landslide.</i>

314
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,915
<i>Well, Buddy had to eat his
hat and both his shoes</i>

315
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,599
<i>when I won the county
in a landslide.</i>

316
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,956
<i>And let me tell you,
that man has big feet</i>

317
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,000
<i>and an even bigger head,
so that was quite a meal.</i>

318
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,990
<i>My daddy used to tell
me a story about people</i>

319
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,151
<i>who count their chickens
before they hatched.</i>

320
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,276
<i>Although, to be fair,</i>

321
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,840
<i>he probably didn't know
what he was talking about,</i>

322
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,832
<i>because he grew
up in Pittsburgh.</i>

323
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,639
<i>And I certainly never saw
a hen around my house,</i>

324
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,915
<i>unless you count my mother.</i>

325
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,201
<i>Do you want me to do something?
But, seriously, folks...</i>

326
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,516
No. Let him talk.

327
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,756
<i>I do love this town.</i>

328
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,633
I don't know if he's ever
going to introduce you.

329
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,275
He will. Just give him time.

330
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,430
It's been an hour.

331
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,796
We were supposed to leave for
Carbondale 10 minutes ago.

332
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,721
I can't interrupt him.
He's the Vice President.

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,237
<i>We're not on the edge
of Penn's Woods.</i>

334
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,560
We need economic development
flowcharts for the Watershed Bill

335
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,001
sent over to
Terry Womack's office.

336
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,070
Hard copies, 20 of them.

337
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,230
I'll do it right away.

338
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,161
How's everything
going with Rachel?

339
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,593
I think she's
a little down in the dumps.

340
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,080
She got a waitressing job last
week, and then they let her go.

341
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,674
Why? She wouldn't tell me.

342
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,797
All she said was
her boss was a creep.

343
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,394
Thirty minutes ago, I
received a text from Zoe.

344
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,637
She intends to apologize,
no doubt.

345
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,871
I respect that she wants
to atone in person,

346
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,357
even though it's taken her over
16 hours to build up the courage.

347
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,073
Janine Skorsky is digging
into Peter Russo.

348
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,269
What in particular?

349
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,834
The Shipbuilder's Association.

350
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,479
She have an angle?

351
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,678
The Watershed Bill is a consolation
prize for them losing their jobs.

352
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,678
That's not
an unfair assessment.

353
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,514
She thinks if the bill fails to
pass, they'll withdraw support.

354
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,353
Not unfair speculation.

355
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,320
Well, I know how hard you've
been working on his campaign,

356
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,995
so I wanted to
give you a heads up.

357
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,875
Well, let me know if she
expands her inquiry.

358
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,235
Into what?

359
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,152
Anything you deem
worth telling.

360
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,360
Well, can I throw her a bone?

361
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,870
She might be more talkative if
I have information for her.

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,150
What sort of bone?

363
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,470
The vote count for the bill.

364
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,393
I don't have a vote count yet.

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,836
Should have a preliminary
one this afternoon.

366
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,910
You'll let me know?

367
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,434
As soon as I have
something solid.

368
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,556
There's one more thing.

369
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,116
About last night...

370
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,839
No need to apologize.

371
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,039
I'm sure you had
a very good reason.

372
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,590
I do.

373
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,352
I think we should end it.

374
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,433
Not professionally,
the other thing.

375
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,350
Why now?

376
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,035
We have a really good
working relationship.

377
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,840
I don't wanna
overcomplicate that.

378
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,315
All right.

379
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,230
You're okay with it?

380
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,430
Completely.

381
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,840
It's over.

382
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,837
And it won't change things
in terms of our arrangement?

383
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,994
Oh, please. I don't punish people
for making adult decisions.

384
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,279
Thank you, Francis.

385
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,037
She was never more than a
faint blip on my radar.

386
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,351
We've served
each other's purpose.

387
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,193
If she wants to be an adult,

388
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,354
let her see how she can fly
once she leaves the nest.

389
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,836
Claire. Hi. Catherine.

390
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,759
Thank you for fitting me in.

391
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,117
I can always find time
for you and Frank.

392
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,193
Well, the reason I'm here

393
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,112
is the CWI has a large shipment

394
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,112
of water filters
stuck in South Sudan,

395
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,193
and they've been in storage
for the past four months,

396
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,112
just sitting there, and the
Sudanese government...

397
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,520
Won't release the shipments
through customs.

398
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,671
My deputy briefed
me on the latest.

399
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,360
Right. And I know that Francis spoke
to you about this not too long ago,

400
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,796
but lately we haven't heard
much from the State Department,

401
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,950
so I was wondering
if you could help.

402
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,476
We've done our best, Claire.
I put my top people on this.

403
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,557
The Sudanese are
just not responding.

404
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,836
Well, is there
anything else we can do?

405
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,674
There's over $200,000
worth of equipment.

406
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,553
I wish I could. I know how
important this is to you,

407
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,996
but we're about to cut
off diplomatic ties.

408
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
It's a directive straight
from the President.

409
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,236
We can't ignore their human
rights violations anymore.

410
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,429
What about back channels?

411
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,510
Well, once we cut ties,

412
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,638
I can't contact their government
officially or unofficially.

413
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,598
Well, is there someone you
could put me in touch with?

414
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,478
I'm sorry, Claire.

415
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,909
My hands are tied.

416
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,994
I would move mountains for you and
Frank, but I've done all I can.

417
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,240
Of course.

418
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,872
Okay. Good to see you. You too.

419
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,959
<i>Congressman,
you have a major bill</i>

420
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,673
<i>going to the floor
later this week.</i>

421
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,989
<i>Are you optimistic it'll pass?</i>

422
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,309
<i>I'm very optimistic.</i>

423
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,834
<i>The Delaware
River Watershed Act</i>

424
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,354
<i>not only protects
large portions of</i>

425
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,954
<i>the state's
freshwater resources,</i>

426
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,918
<i>it also creates
thousands of jobs.</i>

427
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,719
<i>I'm confident that my
colleagues on the Hill...</i>

428
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,359
<i>There's only one way
to create jobs.</i>

429
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,079
<i>I did it during
my administration.</i>

430
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,874
<i>The answer is tax credits
for small businesses.</i>

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,356
<i>You've got to encourage
self-starting entrepreneurs</i>

432
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,591
<i>to start new ventures,
hire employees...</i>

433
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,273
<i>But specifically, about
the Watershed Act...</i>

434
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,589
<i>Small businesses,
that's the solution.</i>

435
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,949
<i>Everything else
is window dressing.</i>

436
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,235
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

437
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,355
Thank you.

438
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,515
Good night, Mr. Vice President.

439
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,915
Hello.

440
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,269
<i>I need to talk about Matthews.</i>

441
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,720
Yes. I've read
the press reports.

442
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,241
He's not being
very helpful, is he?

443
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,757
No, he's doing
more harm than good.

444
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,075
I want to ask him to leave.

445
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,753
Well, that wouldn't make
for a very good story.

446
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,111
It's better than him
torpedoing the whole bus tour.

447
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,236
<i>Have you tried to talk to him?</i>

448
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,800
No, I wanted to ask
your advice first.

449
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,555
Well, maybe there's a way
to keep him on the tour

450
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,869
and inspire his support.

451
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,276
<i>We have fundamentally
different views.</i>

452
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,312
Well, look, you're not going to
be able to change his ideology,

453
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,390
but dig deeper.

454
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,359
<i>Jim is a proud man.
Tap into that pride.</i>

455
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,200
I just wish he was gone.

456
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,794
Well, you do whatever
you think best.

457
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,314
But whatever it is you decide,

458
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,312
be firm and stand up
for yourself.

459
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,198
He'll respond to that at least.

460
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,158
And call me back
if you need anything.

461
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,836
What was the reason he gave you?
Were you messing up?

462
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,709
No. The head waiter said I
was doing a really good job.

463
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,918
He even started letting me take
my own tables on the second day.

464
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,719
And the manager...
What's his name?

465
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,596
Leon.

466
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,269
He propositioned you?

467
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,591
Called me into his office,

468
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,233
said couldn't afford to
start taking anyone new on,

469
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,834
even part-time.

470
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,356
Put his hand on my knee,

471
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,272
said he might be able
to make an exception.

472
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,157
So he starts sliding
his hand up my thigh.

473
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,671
So I stood up and I tell him
I should get back to work.

474
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,473
He says, "Stay."

475
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,880
He unbuckled his belt.

476
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,913
Did you?

477
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,150
No, I walked out of the office
and got back to my tables.

478
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,271
Next day, I came into
work, told me to go home.

479
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,953
I was fired.

480
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,637
Tell me the name
of the restaurant.

481
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,993
You're home early.

482
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,829
I needed a breather. I didn't
have breakfast this morning.

483
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,435
I might head back
in a little while.

484
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,193
The vote count?

485
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,911
It's going to come down
to the wire on this one.

486
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,236
I spoke to
Catherine Durant today.

487
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,996
She's unable to get the
shipment out of South Sudan.

488
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,878
Yeah, we're cutting
all diplomatic ties.

489
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,872
Foreign Affairs is
up in arms about it.

490
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,152
Yes. Which is why she can't lift
a finger, according to her.

491
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,195
It's what she said, anyway.

492
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,509
Anyway, I need you
to talk to her.

493
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,360
I don't think that would
make any difference.

494
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
I thought she owed us, Francis.

495
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,480
She does, but there's limits.

496
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,989
She's Secretary of State. She
can't break diplomatic protocol.

497
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,400
Well, can you make some calls?

498
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,678
If she can't, I can't. Plus I have
to focus on the Watershed Bill.

499
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,955
I'm taking time out of my
schedule to help you with that.

500
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,919
Because you drafted it.
Because you asked me.

501
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,070
I didn't want to do this.

502
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,560
All I'm asking is
that you give me

503
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,000
a little bit of
your time in return.

504
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,040
And how am I supposed to
fix a problem I can't fix?

505
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,190
What about Remy?

506
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,273
Glendon Hill must have
contacts in South Sudan.

507
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,834
He's fighting us on the vote.

508
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,151
Those are two completely
separate issues.

509
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,193
They are not. He does you a
favor, he hangs it over me.

510
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,921
So what you're saying is my
goals are secondary to yours.

511
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,753
That is not what I'm saying.

512
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,234
I think you don't
want to go hat in hand

513
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,840
to somebody who
used to work for you.

514
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,760
I will not be lectured to the
moment you walk in the door!

515
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,312
I called Catherine,
as promised!

516
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,234
Her inability to deliver is
not my problem or my fault!

517
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,710
I cannot control changing
global landscapes!

518
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,113
And I will not be cornered into
making promises I cannot deliver!

519
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,433
I'm sorry I yelled.

520
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,753
I'm under a lot of pressure.

521
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,954
You're right,
I didn't think it through.

522
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,238
I just can't go
to Remy right now.

523
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,720
He's poaching too
many of my people.

524
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,832
I've got two congressmen
who will not commit.

525
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,840
I was hoping you
might speak to them.

526
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,276
Who?

527
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,315
Vanderburgh and Abrams.

528
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,195
What is it you want me
to say to them?

529
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,555
They're big on the environment.

530
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,949
They don't think
the bill goes far enough.

531
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,196
They respect your opinion.

532
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,840
I wanted you to walk them
through the bill step-by-step.

533
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,230
Put them at ease. I need to
get them in the yes column.

534
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,118
I meet with them tomorrow.
I'll deliver the bruises.

535
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,396
You meet with them later
and patch them up.

536
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,836
That might just do the trick.

537
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,959
Of course.

538
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,152
I think I broke the bowl.

539
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,398
We have contacts there
through our oil interests.

540
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,157
I'm going to need
government intervention.

541
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,436
Wherever there's a
government, we know people.

542
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,591
Even when there's only the
illusion of a government.

543
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,356
Will you help me?

544
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,800
I'd like to.

545
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,520
But for something like this, I'm
afraid there's a price tag.

546
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,072
The CWI will endorse
SanCorp as eco-friendly.

547
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,992
They can use our logo on any PR

548
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,992
or marketing
materials you want.

549
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,560
We'll need more than that.

550
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,358
They were willing to donate
over $1 million for that.

551
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,955
These filters are only worth $200,000.
I'd say that's a bargain.

552
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,793
You turned down that offer.

553
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,160
Landscape has
shifted since then.

554
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,356
The Watershed Bill?
That's right.

555
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,275
You want it amended?

556
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,196
I want you to kill it,
the whole thing.

557
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,079
CWI has publicly
backed the bill, Remy.

558
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,200
What you do publicly
is your concern.

559
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,191
Gentlemen. Please, have a seat.

560
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,238
So, have either of you changed
your mind since we last spoke?

561
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,880
We're still undecided, Frank.

562
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,474
Leaning one way or the other?

563
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,791
If Congress is going to
allocate $250 million dollars,

564
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,560
we want to make sure
it goes towards a bill

565
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,636
that does more
to protect the...

566
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,393
We've been through all that.
I know your concerns.

567
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,518
So if the protection
standards don't change,

568
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,479
we would rather see that money
spent more effectively elsewhere.

569
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,549
That sounds like
you're both leaning no.

570
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,713
We've been very clear
about what we're asking.

571
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,516
Okay.

572
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,432
This is you, Abrams.

573
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,876
And this is you, Vanderburgh.

574
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,630
And over here

575
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,431
is the majority of
the Democratic Caucus.

576
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,037
See, you're over there
all by your lonesome.

577
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,032
Now, you don't mind
being the black sheep.

578
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,840
You're the liberal wing
of the liberal wing.

579
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,676
Most of the time you can vote what you
want, we still pass things anyway.

580
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,434
But this time it does matter.

581
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,678
And what the two of you
aren't taking into account

582
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,434
is between this end of the
desk and this end of the desk,

583
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,516
is me.

584
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,957
Now, I'm going to say to you
what I say to every congressman

585
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,401
that sits where
you're sitting now.

586
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,794
Vote your district.
Vote your conscience.

587
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,519
Don't surprise me.

588
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,519
And the most
important one of those

589
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,591
is don't surprise me.

590
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,400
Now, you're both to meet
with my wife tomorrow.

591
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,312
And you're to hear her out.

592
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,040
She will go through your
concerns point-by-point.

593
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,635
And I am certain after that

594
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,760
that the two of you will
make the right decision.

595
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,157
This is the part
where you leave.

596
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,912
I have often found
that bleeding hearts

597
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,560
have an ironic fear
of their own blood.

598
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,433
One drop and they seize up.

599
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,116
But offer them a caring hand
and massage them back to life

600
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,994
and they soon start beating
to the right drum.

601
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,150
Hello.

602
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,038
<i>I've just spoken to
Abrams and Vanderburgh.</i>

603
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,595
Let them toss and turn tonight,

604
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,512
but they're all yours tomorrow.

605
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,430
I'll reach out to their
offices and set a time.

606
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,480
Thank you, Claire.

607
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,355
Of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

608
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,598
Here you go, sir. Enjoy.

609
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,840
Excuse me.
There's a hair on my steak.

610
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,673
I am so sorry, sir. Where?

611
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,953
Right there.

612
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,870
I don't see it.

613
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,434
Are you telling me I'm blind?

614
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,194
No, sir. I'm so sorry.
I'll have the kitchen...

615
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,192
What's your name? Stephanie.

616
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,996
You can leave the plate,
Stephanie.

617
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,360
I'd like to talk
to the manager.

618
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,794
Yes, sir. I'll go get him.

619
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Thank you.

620
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,629
Good evening, sir.

621
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,593
Stephanie tells me there
was a hair on your plate.

622
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,150
No.

623
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,715
There wasn't any hair. Leon, right?
That's your name?

624
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,670
Yes.

625
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,800
Stephanie is a hot little
number, isn't she?

626
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,470
Nice ass.

627
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,921
Did you make her blow you
before or after you hired her?

628
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,154
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

629
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,152
Sit down, Leon.
Sir, I want you to go.

630
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,232
I said sit. Don't make
me call the police.

631
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,800
I'll tell you what.

632
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,440
You call the police, I'll call
the Department of Immigration

633
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,079
about the four
undocumented employees

634
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,839
you have working
in the kitchen.

635
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,910
A felony, Leon.

636
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,318
And I might also mention your
girlfriend, her mother, and her aunt

637
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,518
who are also undocumented and
living in an apartment you pay for.

638
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,154
Prison time for you,
deportation for them.

639
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,840
Not a pretty picture, is it?

640
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,120
Let's talk about Rachel Posner.

641
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,110
How close is it?

642
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,159
I should have the last two
votes I need committed today.

643
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I just want to make sure
no one changes their mind.

644
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,792
I'd prefer not to get embroiled

645
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,952
in environmental
issues at this time.

646
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,117
But it's also
a jobs creation package.

647
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,873
It's antagonizing oil and gas.

648
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,519
We can't afford
that sort of battle

649
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,199
after all the capital
we spent on education.

650
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,313
All I need is one public
statement of support.

651
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,400
I won't do that. How about
you take Linda tomorrow?

652
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,358
You set her up in your offices.

653
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,830
Any meetings or calls you
might need to whip up votes,

654
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,990
you've got her there.

655
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,992
Well, I can't afford to spend a
whole day lobbying on the Hill.

656
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,309
Well, you've got deputies.

657
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,035
Yes, I do.

658
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,680
Well, you're telling me you can't
manage them from 10 blocks away?

659
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,989
Of course I can, sir.

660
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,349
Look, if it's too difficult...

661
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,035
No, no, no. We'll help you out, Frank.
Won't we, Linda?

662
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,880
Yes. If you'll just excuse me,

663
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,429
I have a few things to
rearrange on my schedule.

664
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,513
What else, Frank? Tell
me what Birch is up to.

665
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
No, I know I've
already canceled twice.

666
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,832
They start next week.

667
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,673
Sweetie, I'm trying
to figure this out.

668
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,592
Linda. Excuse me. Yes?

669
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,720
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to pitch in,

670
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,750
I know you have a full plate.

671
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,830
Of course, Frank.

672
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,555
Is everything all right?
It sounds like...

673
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,632
Yes. What time do you want
me to come by tomorrow?

674
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,680
Can we talk?

675
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,075
Can I just call you back in one second?
I will call you. Yes.

676
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,234
Linda, I am so sorry that the
President has forced you into this.

677
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,280
It was not my intention.

678
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,953
If you would like, I can
talk to Congress...

679
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,078
No, it's not that. It's a personal matter.
Don't worry.

680
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,913
Well, what is it?
Maybe I can help.

681
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,632
Just, my son didn't
get into Stanford.

682
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,040
I was supposed to meet
with the Provost tomorrow

683
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,880
to see if I could get
him to change his mind.

684
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,000
I asked the President if I
could go, and he said yes,

685
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,196
but he must have forgotten.

686
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,158
You should go. I'm sure the
President will understand.

687
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,515
No, no. I don't let
personal matters

688
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,915
get in the way
of my job, Frank.

689
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,316
Linda, you can't put your
entire life on hold.

690
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,312
And certainly not at the
expense of your own son.

691
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,471
Well, it has been at
the expense of my son.

692
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,631
It's my fault he didn't get in.

693
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,189
I was on the campaign and
I wasn't there for him.

694
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,114
His grades suffered.
His application was...

695
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,040
I wasn't there, Frank.

696
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,441
But I figured if
I could just meet

697
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,960
with the Provost
face to face...

698
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,430
Okay, look, you are going
to Stanford tomorrow.

699
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,756
If you show up at my office,
I won't let you in,

700
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,880
so don't even consider it.

701
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,758
Frank, the President
wants me to be...

702
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,274
He doesn't have to know.

703
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm going to have one of my
schedulers buy you a ticket.

704
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,474
The bill will be fine.

705
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,914
Frank.

706
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,430
You don't have to do this.

707
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,718
We may have our
disagreements, Linda,

708
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,395
but that doesn't mean we can't
look out for each other.

709
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,279
You tell them you're coming.

710
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,273
Okay. Give that a try.

711
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,350
Test, test, test.

712
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,591
<i>All right, Zoe. This is Dave, the
senior producer in New York.</i>

713
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,757
<i>We'll go live in four minutes.
Sounds good.</i>

714
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,355
<i>The first topic will be the Congressional
agenda for the fall session,</i>

715
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,954
<i>then we'll move
on to the midterms,</i>

716
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,918
<i>then we'll wrap it up with Peter
Russo's race for governor</i>

717
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,559
<i>and his Watershed Bill.
Okay, great.</i>

718
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,871
<i>Taking you off
mic until 30 out.</i>

719
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,191
Hey, Janine, I have to talk
about the Watershed Bill.

720
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,509
Do you have a one sheet?

721
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,074
Yeah. Hold on.

722
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,630
Thanks.

723
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,870
Any word on the vote count?

724
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,229
Still no luck.

725
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,313
I've called every Democrat in the
House to cobble together a number,

726
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,119
but no one's
getting back to me.

727
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,839
So what can I say?

728
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,959
That there's a lot in
flux, and it'll be tight.

729
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,315
Okay. Thanks.

730
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,079
Yeah. Sure thing.

731
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,073
Hey, Francis, it's me.
Call me back.

732
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,355
Yes.

733
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,279
Congressman Russo.
He says it's urgent.

734
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,430
Fine.

735
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,314
Good morning, sir.

736
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,278
I'd like to talk about
how the tour's going.

737
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,431
Well, let's talk on the bus.
Don't we have an event at 11:00?

738
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,193
There won't be any
events until we talk.

739
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,759
You're hijacking
the microphone.

740
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,520
You're contradicting
everything I say.

741
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,512
We need to be promoting
the Watershed Act.

742
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,557
Well, I appreciate your
being so forthright.

743
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,870
Let me tell you what
I don't appreciate.

744
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,312
The DNC is running a man
with zero track record,

745
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,756
except for substance
abuse, to fill my shoes.

746
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,069
I realize you don't
want to be here, sir,

747
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,437
but it seems like you're deliberately
trying to sabotage my campaign.

748
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,796
Despite my better judgment,
I'm trying to save it.

749
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,112
I know the people of this
state better than you, Peter.

750
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,630
They don't want to hear about watersheds.
They want to hear about jobs.

751
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,915
Well, this week,
they need to hear both.

752
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,315
Well, then,
maybe I should just stand

753
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,680
quietly beside
you at the podium

754
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,716
and watch you lose.

755
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,797
You don't think I can win, do you?
I'm not optimistic.

756
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,349
You lost the first two times
you ran for governor.

757
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,671
The third time, nobody
thought you had a chance.

758
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,231
By September, you were 15 points down.
You were out of money.

759
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,390
You had to mortgage
your own house

760
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,630
just to keep your
staff on payroll.

761
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,361
I'm well aware of what I did.
I was there.

762
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,993
My point is you kept going.

763
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,675
You hit 67 counties
in less than 20 days,

764
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,752
and you proved everyone wrong.

765
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,036
Like it or not, it's my name
on the ticket this time,

766
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,635
and I got the shot, and I'm
gonna prove everyone wrong,

767
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,598
just like you did.
Including you, sir.

768
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,799
I would like your support,

769
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,270
but if you won't give it, fine.

770
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,275
It won't stop me.

771
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,835
You think it's easy
for me to be here?

772
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,550
I left the Governor's
mansion right in my prime.

773
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,399
To be what? Vice President.

774
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,392
I thought that was a step up.

775
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,234
But you know what? I don't have a
fucking shred of real influence.

776
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,231
I'm trotted around like a goddamn
mascot, and this is my home state.

777
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,071
I'm offering you
influence, sir.

778
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,598
I'd like your guidance
and your expertise.

779
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,879
But if that's not on the
table, then, well...

780
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,952
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President,

781
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,072
you should head
back to Washington.

782
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,074
<i>Your husband was very explicit.</i>

783
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,993
I would categorize it
as a threat.

784
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,037
What did he say exactly?

785
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,839
Not to surprise him.

786
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,634
Didn't he also tell you to vote
your district and your conscience?

787
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,277
He did, but those seemed far
lower on his priority list.

788
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,794
Well, he would never fault you

789
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,395
if you had a compelling reason
to do what you think is right.

790
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,040
I'm confused.
Aren't you for this bill?

791
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,078
CWI is publicly for it.

792
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,232
Privately, I have my doubts
for the same reasons you do.

793
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,391
I was under the impression
that we were here

794
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,557
so you could
persuade us to vote yes.

795
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm not trying to
persuade you of anything.

796
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,355
I will say this.

797
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,194
If the bill fails, it's
not the end of the world.

798
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,840
We can always
sponsor new legislation.

799
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,833
You know, something with
stricter regulatory standards.

800
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,593
Just to be clear,
you're telling us

801
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,400
you don't mind if we
vote against the bill?

802
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,517
I'm simply saying
what my husband would...

803
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,354
That you should
vote your conscience.

804
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,075
<i>How are we looking?</i>

805
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,756
We're short a vote.

806
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,910
I just got off
the phone with Claire.

807
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,639
Vanderburgh and Abrams
are on board.

808
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,712
Those are definite yeses?
Definite.

809
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,439
We should be good.

810
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,236
Yes?

811
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,121
I've been trying to reach
you since yesterday.

812
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,351
<i>Well, I've been a bit
busy counting votes.</i>

813
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,715
You said you'd
have a number for me.

814
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,593
<i>Well, you should try
my press office.</i>

815
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,791
I did.
They won't return
my calls.

816
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,435
Well, the official word
is it will be close.

817
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm trying to get
the unofficial word.

818
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,794
I can't appear to be playing
favorites now, can I?

819
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,560
This isn't because of
the other day, is it?

820
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,710
What other day?

821
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,716
You said we'd keep our
professional relationship.

822
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,076
Well, this is what
professional feels like.

823
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,159
The Vice President of the
United States, Jim Matthews!

824
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,230
Thank you.

825
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,269
It's good to be
back in Bristol.

826
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,513
Go, warriors!

827
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,070
Now, you all know me.
I'm a windbag.

828
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,193
I can go on until
you all fall asleep,

829
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,273
get eight hours of shut-eye, and
wake up to find me still yapping.

830
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,957
And there's a lot I could say
about this young man to my left.

831
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,560
The truth is, I've had a lot of
doubts about him and his ideas,

832
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,233
about his past,

833
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,989
about his youth.

834
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,918
But if you'll remember,

835
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,311
a lot of you had doubts about
me the first time I ran.

836
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,234
And the second and the third.

837
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,676
But over the last few days,

838
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,434
traveling around
the state with Peter,

839
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,633
I have to admit
he's won me over.

840
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,794
He's smart, he's energetic, and
most important, he's a fighter.

841
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,237
Now, it says "A fresh start!"
on that bus over there.

842
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,397
And that's the real truth,

843
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,392
because this young man
will give our state

844
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,432
the fresh start
it so desperately needs.

845
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,350
Ladies and gentlemen, the next
Governor of Pennsylvania,

846
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,760
Peter Russo.

847
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,433
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

848
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,717
How's it going, Bristol?

849
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,431
Today I'd like to talk to you
about economic recovery.

850
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,000
Now, as many of you
may be aware,

851
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,753
mostly because my opponent

852
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,151
feels the need to spend millions of
dollars on TV ads about my past,

853
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
I know a thing or two
about recovery.

854
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,355
I've learned a great deal
through my personal struggles.

855
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,673
I've learned how to harness
my strength and my resolve,

856
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,234
make them work for me,

857
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,835
much the way your
Bristol watermills

858
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,515
harnessed the power of
your beautiful Otter Creek

859
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,399
and the mighty
Delaware River years ago.

860
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,160
Let me tell you how
the Delaware River

861
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,199
will reinvigorate your
economy for years to come!

862
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,480
We're going to get the
shipment out of Sudan.

863
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,557
That's great.
It might take
a few weeks,

864
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,797
but I think you should start
making arrangements for Botswana,

865
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,315
where you're gonna set up
base camp and the depot.

866
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,677
Just send me a budget as
soon as you've got one.

867
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,990
Claire, is there any way we
can send someone in my place?

868
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,081
I thought you wanted
to be on the ground.

869
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,798
I would, but I can't this time.

870
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,356
Why not?

871
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,117
I wasn't sure how to tell you this,
but I passed the 12-week mark.

872
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,515
You're expecting?

873
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,393
Gillian, that's wonderful.

874
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,240
That... When did this happen?
Who's the father?

875
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,279
There was this guy I met overseas.
Doctors Without Borders.

876
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,517
We had this thing. Then I left.

877
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,117
But he came back to the
States a few months ago,

878
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,351
and that's when it happened.

879
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,313
Anyway, it didn't end well.

880
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,954
But I want to keep the baby.

881
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,759
And does he know?

882
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,076
He's married.

883
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,911
I shouldn't have. It was stupid.
You don't have to explain.

884
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,040
I'll need some time off at
the beginning of March.

885
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,434
Of course.

886
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,954
And absolutely, we'll send
someone else instead.

887
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,838
I appreciate it, Claire.

888
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,155
Sure.

889
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,914
<i>You said medium rare?</i>

890
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,238
Just let me know if you
guys need anything.

891
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,720
Who would you guess
texted me just now?

892
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,712
I thought she'd last
more than a couple days.

893
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,680
Going somewhere?
Just for
an hour or two.

894
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,320
I got one last
hold-out to whip.

895
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,912
What's the vote count
on Russo's bill?

896
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,837
Don't you wanna shower first before
we dirty ourselves with business?

897
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,311
I'll shower after you leave.
What's the vote count?

898
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,278
Your tone doesn't inspire
me to be very forthcoming.

899
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,030
The fuck wasn't enough? You
need a special tone too?

900
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,796
Ooh...

901
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,112
Someone washed her mouth out
with acid this morning.

902
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,393
Whatever it is
you're grappling with,

903
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,312
I am sincerely not interested.

904
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,153
You're almost twice my age.

905
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,280
You said that
didn't bother you.

906
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,555
I lied.

907
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,476
If you had a daughter,
she'd be older than me.

908
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,678
In 20 years, I'll still be
younger than you are now.

909
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,991
Well, I can't argue
with basic arithmetic.

910
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,634
You don't find that disgusting?

911
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,072
I think you want me to.

912
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,073
But I've never considered
this any more or less

913
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,358
than a transaction between
two consenting adults.

914
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,511
If you just want the girl who
will do your bidding for you,

915
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,432
you already have that.

916
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,840
Why do you need to fuck me?

917
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,715
I would remind you that it was
you who initiated our affair,

918
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,077
and it was you who came knocking
at my door last winter.

919
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,119
And it was me who asked that
we stop what we're doing now.

920
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,516
Which I respected until
you picked up a phone

921
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,398
and asked me to
come over tonight.

922
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,160
Because you wouldn't give me
what I wanted unless I did.

923
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,475
So tell me,
why do you need this?

924
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,359
You don't seem to get
any pleasure out of it.

925
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,432
I know I certainly don't.

926
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,555
I seem to always
leave you satisfied.

927
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,517
How do you know
I'm not faking it?

928
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,630
Are you?

929
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,719
Doesn't it say a lot
that you can't tell?

930
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,674
What do you think about when
I'm up against the wall?

931
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,400
A great man once said that
"Everything in life is about sex...

932
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,838
"Except sex.

933
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,240
"Sex is about power."

934
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,992
So you need a whore,

935
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,155
which makes you a pimp.

936
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,870
I'm not a pimp.
Just a very generous john.

937
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,830
Fine.

938
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,074
As long as we're clear about what
this is, I can play the whore.

939
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,160
Now pay me.

940
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,035
The bill will pass. We
have it by two votes.

941
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,350
You can pass that along to
your friend, Ms. Skorsky.

942
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,431
If she must say such things in
order to sleep at night, so be it.

943
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,479
Her loyalty costs me nothing but
the occasional crumb of news.

944
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,234
Her hatefulness
takes no toll at all.

945
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:36,800
You don't compensate a working
girl so you can cuddle after.

946
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,075
<i>Final voting...</i>

947
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,153
A lot of small towns,
some really great crowds.

948
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,080
<i>No buses losing their brakes.
Final call for voting.</i>

949
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,152
Please, no.
When do you head back?

950
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,715
Tomorrow. We wanna do a press
conference when all the votes are in.

951
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,280
<i>Members, please cast
your votes now.</i>

952
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,396
Are you all right?

953
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,641
I'm just a little nauseous.

954
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,512
It'll pass. I'm okay.

955
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,721
You said you're due in March?

956
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,796
March 14th.

957
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,996
It must be so exciting.

958
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,070
How's the morning sickness?

959
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,280
I think I'm over the hump. I
have to pee all the time.

960
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,113
Weird cravings.

961
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,754
It was good
to be on the road again.

962
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,950
Invigorating.

963
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,958
Our internals are showing a
nice bump in the numbers.

964
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,474
You made a big difference, sir.

965
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,916
The President
is grateful,
and so am I.

966
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,992
Well, it's a team
effort, right?

967
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,596
Excuse me. I have yet to say
hello to your better half.

968
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,830
How'd it go at Stanford?

969
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,076
Well, I think.

970
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,595
The Dean's a Republican, so there
was not a lot of small talk.

971
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,200
But he seemed open
to considering it.

972
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,232
We'll know more next week.
That's terrific.

973
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,600
I appreciate
your helping me out.

974
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,841
I didn't do anything. Anybody
could book a plane ticket.

975
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,752
That's not true.
You covered for me.

976
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,151
Well, we have to keep the important
things in perspective, right?

977
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,596
Don't think it's
bought you any favors.

978
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,514
Kindness isn't kindness
if you expect a reward.

979
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,639
The man of the hour!

980
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,552
Not yet. The votes
are still coming in.

981
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,472
Hey, how'd you vote?
I voted yes.

982
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,839
Voting.
I knew I forgot something.

983
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,876
We got this.

984
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,634
There's some sparkling grape
juice there to celebrate.

985
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,915
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

986
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,236
Thirty seconds. Looking good.

987
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,950
<i>Come on, everyone. Let's go.</i>

988
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,793
<i>Everyone's voting
along party lines.</i>

989
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,310
<i>See? This is what happens
when we all stick together.</i>

990
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,834
<i>This is an easy win for us.</i>

991
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,479
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

992
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,236
<i>Vote now.</i>

993
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,549
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

994
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,193
Fuck. This can't be happening.

995
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,312
<i>Members, please cast
your votes now.</i>

996
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:30,400
<i>Voting is closed. H.R.
4913 is defeated.</i>

997
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,871
Doug. I thought we had it.

998
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,152
So this means it's dead?

999
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,119
It's such a shame.
All of that hard work.

1000
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,672
I wanna know who lied.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
