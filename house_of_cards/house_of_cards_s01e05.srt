1
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,330
What do you think of Darren Jarvis?

2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,150
- At CBS?
- He wants me to be a correspondent.

3
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,583
Not worth your time.

4
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,329
What about Greer Fisher at MSNBC?

5
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,170
Stick to writing.

6
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,928
Do TV on the side.

7
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:08,383
You're more than a talking head.

8
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:11,763
- How about Slugline?
- What's Slugline?

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,163
If I said Politico wanted
to hire me, what would you say?

10
00:01:15,263 --> 00:01:17,476
I would say that that peaks my interest.

11
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,478
Six months from now, Slugline will be
what Politico was a year and a half ago.

12
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,790
Everyone at Politico reads it, because
Slugline's breaking stories before they are.

13
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,435
I wonder why I've never heard of it.

14
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:28,645
Everyone's a free agent.
They write whatever they want,

15
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:29,750
wherever they are.

16
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,006
Most people write from their phones.

17
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:34,737
Well, if freedom and exposure
are what they're offering,

18
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:37,375
I would say that is a meeting
worth taking.

19
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:39,640
This Hammerschmidt thing is blowing up.

20
00:01:39,786 --> 00:01:41,615
I think he might get fired.

21
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:43,128
There's gotta be 1,000 tweets here.

22
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,587
People defending me, people trashing me.

23
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,069
There's even a hashtag--
"gozoe."

24
00:01:48,169 --> 00:01:49,691
Mmm.

25
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,840
Mmm.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,858
Hey!

27
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,818
We mustn't leave any trails.

28
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,325
All of my contacts are in there.

29
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:59,470
Then it's time for you
to get some new contacts.

30
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,230
Don't worry. I'll get you a phone.
I'll get you two, in fact.

31
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,382
One for work and a burner for play.

32
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,638
Expect them this afternoon.

33
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:14,186
Oh, and go, Zoe.

34
00:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,057
The reporter?

35
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:24,672
Yes.

36
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:26,960
Just this once?

37
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:32,551
I'm not sure.

38
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:34,673
What does she offer us?

39
00:04:35,506 --> 00:04:37,377
A mouthpiece when we need one.

40
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,011
She's been very useful so far.

41
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:41,019
- What does she want?
- Access.

42
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:42,774
A seat at the table.

43
00:04:42,874 --> 00:04:45,038
Sounds like she's getting
the better side of the bargain.

44
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:47,738
She can be controlled.

45
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:49,412
Are you sure?

46
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:52,114
She can.
I promise you.

47
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:54,957
Okay. If you say so.

48
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:58,157
- The moment you want me to end it--
- I know, Francis.

49
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,072
I should get ready for work.

50
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:17,208
Hey.

51
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,342
Didn't think you'd be in till later.

52
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:20,890
This is your agenda for the day.

53
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,858
Here's your schedule
for the rest of the week.

54
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,023
These are papers that need
to be approved or signed.

55
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:27,672
Over here are your one-sheets
for committee meetings

56
00:05:27,772 --> 00:05:30,231
and briefs on upcoming
legislative action.

57
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,229
I filled Ashley in. She can cover
until you find a replacement.

58
00:05:41,746 --> 00:05:43,657
Christina...

59
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:45,752
What?

60
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,978
Thank you...

61
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:53,156
for getting all this in order.

62
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:01,286
Ashley can call me if you have any
questions about what's on your desk.

63
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:06,176
Is he here yet?

64
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:07,688
I put him in your office.

65
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,638
Marty Spinella, head lobbyist
for the teachers' union.

66
00:06:15,738 --> 00:06:18,273
He wants to rip my head off
and peel it like an orange.

67
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:20,914
Why? Because I lied to him.
But what choice did I have

68
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:24,289
when the truth would've ended the
conversation before it began?

69
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,142
- I'll call you back.
- Marty.

70
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,695
You fucking lied, Frank?

71
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:31,659
No, no. You lied
to my fucking face?

72
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,538
- Marty, I did not lie.
- Did not--

73
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:35,459
We spent the whole weekend in that room

74
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,174
pouring over this bill line by line,

75
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:39,547
and nowhere did it say anything
about collective bargaining.

76
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:42,806
Let's calm down and sit down,
and we will discuss this.

77
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:44,862
I will explain everything
that's going on,

78
00:06:44,962 --> 00:06:47,186
and we will talk it out
no matter how long it takes.

79
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,098
No, no more. This is
gonna be a very short meeting,

80
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:51,018
'cause only one of two things
are gonna happen:

81
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:54,123
Either you assure me right now
that amendment is out,

82
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:57,081
or I'm walking out that door and I'm
gonna start launching missiles.

83
00:06:57,181 --> 00:06:59,306
The amendment was never intended
to stay in the bill.

84
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,219
It was just there for leverage,
that's all.

85
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,568
You threatened to cut federal funding
from union school districts?

86
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,356
That's not a poker chip, Frank.
That's a goddamn dirty bomb.

87
00:07:07,456 --> 00:07:12,567
Look, the amendment
is not staying in the bill.

88
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:15,481
I just need you to work with me
on performance standards.

89
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:19,462
Performance standards?
Are you fucking kidding me?

90
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,256
You agreed that they were already out!
You can't just put them back in!

91
00:07:21,356 --> 00:07:23,995
- Marty, look--
- I have a reputation to uphold!

92
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,410
I am the one that made the
union reps stay here for you

93
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,707
while you were in Gaffney playing
with your fucking Peachoid!

94
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:32,680
- Marty-- - You tell me right now!
Is that amendment in or out?

95
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,477
There is a middle ground here, Marty.

96
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:37,886
We just have to find it.

97
00:07:39,147 --> 00:07:41,232
I take that as a no.

98
00:07:43,467 --> 00:07:45,343
Okay.

99
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:50,650
Marty, do not start a war
you know you're gonna lose.

100
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,504
You fuck me, I fuck back.

101
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:58,846
Stamper!

102
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,105
Marty and I have
a good working relationship.

103
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,181
Or used to.
You can see he has a temper,

104
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,119
but I can usually cut through
that and reason with him.

105
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,672
But I may have pushed him
too far, which is worrisome.

106
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:11,169
Friends make the worst enemies.

107
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:14,542
- How'd it go?
- What did you hear?

108
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:18,093
- A lot of "fucks."
- Well, that pretty much says it.

109
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:19,611
Let's think this through.

110
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,620
We've got the D.N.C.
leadership meeting.

111
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,438
- What? - I'd say you could skip it,
but Birch just dumped it on us.

112
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,788
- When?
- It's here in 12 minutes.

113
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:28,740
Why here and not
the D.N.C. headquarters?

114
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,169
The D.N.C. is doing renovations.

115
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,609
They're gonna be green energy efficient.

116
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:34,846
Oh, that's a charming use
of party funds.

117
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:37,188
We've only been in this space
about three months.

118
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:38,486
It's cool.

119
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,500
Not exactly the Herald, is it?

120
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,337
Have you been to those offices?

121
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:45,566
Yes. Wrist-slitting
was in order.

122
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:48,276
So, who else is courting you?

123
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,996
- A few people.
- You mean everyone.

124
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:53,226
There were a lot of e-mails
this morning.

125
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,261
That's not surprising.
You're having a moment.

126
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,138
People are interested.
I'm one of them.

127
00:08:57,238 --> 00:09:00,530
But if eight minutes passes
on anything, I get bored.

128
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,318
In eight minutes, I can be bored with
you, unless you keep me interested.

129
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,832
I think you can.

130
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:09,495
And I think this is the place for you to
keep the rest of the world interested too.

131
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,501
It's your call.
I won't chase you.

132
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,847
I'm definitely tempted.

133
00:09:12,947 --> 00:09:14,860
Take as long as you want to look around.

134
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,370
E-mail me your figure. I'll
call you back with a counter.

135
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:24,994
This is our top priority--
Ohio,

136
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,145
Florida, and Pennsylvania.

137
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:29,631
We need all of them, or Walker's
a one-term president.

138
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,948
Pennsylvania is why he picked
Matthews as a running mate.

139
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,614
But now we have to find a replacement.

140
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:35,866
The special election is this November.

141
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,555
Patricia Whittaker,
D.N.C. chair.

142
00:09:38,655 --> 00:09:41,112
A rare example of someone
whose head is in the game

143
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:42,855
instead of up their backside.

144
00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,187
Competence is such
an exotic bird in these woods

145
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,221
that I appreciate it whenever I see it.

146
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,139
This also affects the house.

147
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,141
The new governor
will oversee redistricting.

148
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:53,877
We lose seats here, that means we could
lose our majority in Washington.

149
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:57,046
Well, the R.N.C. is backing Jack Swofford,
ex-Mayor of Pittsburgh.

150
00:09:57,146 --> 00:10:00,573
He's got statewide name recognition
and campaign machinery in place.

151
00:10:00,673 --> 00:10:03,521
It's been three months,
and we don't have dick.

152
00:10:03,621 --> 00:10:05,255
What about the A.G.?
Ben Pluckett?

153
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,832
No. Ben's got his eyes
set on the senate in '14.

154
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:10,965
Which he'll lose because he botched
a sex offender sting last year.

155
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,145
- There's always McHolland.
- He's 78.

156
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,508
When's the last time he held
office, when Carter was president?

157
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:17,378
Reagan, but same difference.

158
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,176
He has dignity, he has gravitas.

159
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:21,221
If you need someone
to fill Matthews' shoes--

160
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,670
You can't fill Jim Matthews'
shoes, so we shouldn't even try.

161
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,969
- We need a fresh face.
- The state has a weak bench.

162
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,391
Let's go through all the
sitting Congressmen one by one

163
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:30,809
and see if anybody sticks out
from the crowd.

164
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:32,576
All right.
I got the list right here.

165
00:10:32,676 --> 00:10:34,132
Okay. Go ahead.

166
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:36,182
Pennsylvania's first district,
Peter Russo.

167
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:39,038
Cross him off. He's no good.
No experience, no chops.

168
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,838
Okay, moving on. Second
district, Gwendolyn Pierce.

169
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:44,925
Nah, Gwen's too controversial.
Very vocal on abortion.

170
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,942
- And Caroline?
- She's good.

171
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,860
- And the boys?
- All fucking four of 'em?

172
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,983
You feed 'em.

173
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,553
You got any pictures on your phone?

174
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,990
Come on. Let's cut the shit,
Pete, will ya?

175
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,740
What are we gonna do about the shipyard?

176
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:03,684
BRAC had their hearing.
They slated it for closing.

177
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:05,906
Yeah, and why didn't you testify?

178
00:11:06,006 --> 00:11:08,146
We're talking 12,000 jobs here.

179
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,549
My hands were tied, Paul.
People wanted it closed.

180
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:12,419
- I was under a lot of pressure.
- From who?

181
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,503
People high up the food chain.

182
00:11:14,603 --> 00:11:17,032
- There was nothing I could do.
- That's bullshit!

183
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:18,898
You go back to BRAC.
You talk to the D.O.D.

184
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:21,065
You talk to the Secretary of the Navy.
You do something.

185
00:11:21,165 --> 00:11:22,490
It's not gonna happen.

186
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,910
- Okay. Why not?
- I told you. It's political.

187
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,250
So I'm supposed to go back to the shipbuilders'
association and say what now exactly?

188
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,398
That they're out of work because
Pete Russo's playing politics?

189
00:11:32,668 --> 00:11:34,538
I mean, Jesus, Pete.

190
00:11:34,638 --> 00:11:38,420
We're the ones who got you fucking
elected in the first place.

191
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,993
Now you're gonna turn your back on us?

192
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:43,073
You should go.

193
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:45,979
Seriously?

194
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,373
I just got here.
You're kicking me out now?

195
00:11:51,473 --> 00:11:54,477
Hey, I'm fucking talking to you!

196
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,101
I thought we grew up together.

197
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:02,553
But this guy
sitting behind his big desk...

198
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,809
I don't even know who the fuck he is.

199
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,600
Where's the Pete Russo who knew how to throw
a punch when his back was against the wall?

200
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,093
That guy was my friend.

201
00:12:24,388 --> 00:12:26,668
Every teacher in the country
a month before school ends?

202
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:29,601
Doesn't need all of them.
15, 20 states, that's all.

203
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:31,785
The A.F.T. and the N.E.A.
can't agree on anything.

204
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,915
You underestimate Marty Spinella.

205
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,196
So which one do we target?

206
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:40,264
We have a better chance
with the N.E.A.

207
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:42,303
You think Chuck Sloan will bite?

208
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,955
Cooperate-- we'll give your people
protection and a place at the banquet.

209
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,677
Fight us, we break you. He'll bite.
Get him on the phone.

210
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,212
It's after 2:00.

211
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,507
Spinella is potentially mobilizing

212
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:53,543
the largest teachers' strike
in United States history.

213
00:12:53,643 --> 00:12:56,552
- Nobody's sleeping.
- I'll call him right now.

214
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,542
I'm sorry.
Are we being too loud?

215
00:12:59,642 --> 00:13:02,134
A little.

216
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,141
- What are you working on?
- The gala.

217
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:07,918
There's so much to do.

218
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:10,473
- Did Nancy send you my list?
- She did.

219
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:13,073
- What'd you think?
- It's a good list.

220
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,362
Thanks for inviting them.

221
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:19,666
Is something wrong?

222
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,605
It's still not anywhere near
what Remy brought to the table.

223
00:13:25,628 --> 00:13:27,949
Sancorp offered 1.5 million,
Francis.

224
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:31,453
I'm adding up the numbers, and
we're only at half a million.

225
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:33,626
- I got Chuck on the phone.
- In a minute.

226
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,766
- I can make more calls.
- Enough to raise a million-five?

227
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:38,333
I can at least get us closer.

228
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:42,011
I'm going to bed.

229
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:45,220
Don't move any of this around.

230
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,388
Claire, we made the decision
to turn Remy down.

231
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:52,078
No one forced you.
I thought we were okay on this.

232
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,634
You're right.

233
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,047
Good night, Francis.

234
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,149
This is Adam. Leave a message.

235
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,509
Hi, Adam. It's me.
I know it's late,

236
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:48,340
but, well, I was really just calling

237
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,588
to thank you again for the photographs.

238
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:53,884
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

239
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,197
I hope you're well.

240
00:15:00,828 --> 00:15:04,457
I'm sure they're gonna be
a big hit at the auction.

241
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,730
I hope you're well.

242
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:26,516
Right this way,
Mr. Hammerschmidt.

243
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,371
He's here.

244
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:36,908
Good afternoon, Tom.

245
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:42,328
Legal?

246
00:15:42,428 --> 00:15:45,477
Did you say it, or didn't you?

247
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:51,584
To you and to anyone who asks,
yes, I did.

248
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,258
Do we really need them?

249
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:57,182
Not unless I should expect a fight.

250
00:15:57,282 --> 00:15:58,774
You shouldn't.

251
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,291
Give us a few moments.

252
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,588
It's not what you called her, it's
that you let her leave the building.

253
00:16:16,688 --> 00:16:18,829
I know how to run a paper, Margaret.

254
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,620
What I don't know how to do is run a paper
staffed with people I can't control.

255
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,460
Was she really out of control?

256
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,812
To my understanding, she simply
turned down a new position.

257
00:16:27,912 --> 00:16:30,436
It's her attitude.
It's the way she turned it down.

258
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,831
Did you think to ask her
what she'd rather do instead?

259
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,957
- Is it my job to pander to all my employees--
- My employees.

260
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,662
And if they have something to offer
that you don't, yes, it is your job.

261
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:42,970
We've been through this, Tom.

262
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,268
The paper's operating at a loss.

263
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,487
We need people like Zoe.

264
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,054
I'm very aware

265
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,062
of how much we're hurting, Margaret.

266
00:16:50,162 --> 00:16:52,308
Staff reductions, dip in circulation.

267
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,813
Each one of those faces

268
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,332
and every subscriber we lose,

269
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,852
they keep me awake at night.

270
00:16:56,952 --> 00:17:00,047
Now, I won't argue
the business side of things.

271
00:17:00,147 --> 00:17:02,432
It's neither my place
nor my area of expertise,

272
00:17:02,532 --> 00:17:04,750
but know this--

273
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,704
Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs,

274
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:11,356
enriched media,

275
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:13,507
they're all surface.

276
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,176
They're fads.

277
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:17,305
They aren't the foundation
this paper was built on,

278
00:17:17,405 --> 00:17:20,324
and they aren't what will keep it alive.

279
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,426
We have a core readership

280
00:17:22,526 --> 00:17:24,627
that thirsts for hard news.

281
00:17:24,727 --> 00:17:30,382
Those are the people I work
80 hours a week for.

282
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,354
And I won't be distracted
by what's fashionable.

283
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,021
That's your resignation letter.

284
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,331
Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.

285
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:49,479
I'll give you some privacy.

286
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,366
No, no, stay.
It'll be quick.

287
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,352
We'll get a drink.

288
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:02,142
We're going to launch
right here in Washington.

289
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,735
We'll see how Congress likes it

290
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:04,845
when the streets are teaming

291
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:06,455
with unsupervised school kids.

292
00:18:06,555 --> 00:18:08,953
Then we'll phase out
the rest of the country.

293
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:10,207
Everybody hold on for one minute.

294
00:18:10,307 --> 00:18:11,202
What's up?

295
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:12,856
The N.E.A. is out.

296
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:13,965
- Hang on.
- What?

297
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:15,166
They pulled out.

298
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,162
Why?

299
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:19,367
He wouldn't say.

300
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:20,894
Hold on for one more minute.

301
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,535
Chuck Sloan-- get him
on the phone right now.

302
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,685
I've got him right here.

303
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,211
- Is he muted?
- Yes.

304
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,941
Hey, Chuck.
It's Marty.

305
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,801
Listen, you can't do this.

306
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:38,254
If we don't stay united now,
we don't have a--

307
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:40,183
You hired me to represent
your interests, right?

308
00:18:40,283 --> 00:18:42,347
How can I possibly lobby
for the teachers

309
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:43,731
when Congress sees us splintering

310
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,585
before we even put up
a unite--

311
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,394
All right.

312
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,581
Did Underwood get to you?

313
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,564
Whoa, Frank is dishonest
and manipulative.

314
00:18:54,664 --> 00:18:56,298
You've seen that he's lied
to us already.

315
00:18:56,398 --> 00:18:58,140
Wait-whoa-whoa-whoa, Chuck,
Ch-Ch-Chuck?

316
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,401
Chuck!

317
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:02,678
Son of a bitch!

318
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:07,111
- Where are you?
- I'm at the office.

319
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,409
- False.
- You don't believe me?

320
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:10,669
- Not for a second.
- Where are you?

321
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:12,868
- About to walk into a meeting.
- With who?

322
00:19:12,968 --> 00:19:14,332
Someone I have to punish.

323
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:16,548
- Give me a name.
- No name.

324
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:18,421
What did this person do wrong?

325
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:19,769
Lie to me.

326
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,783
How will you punish him?

327
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,626
What makes you think it's a him?

328
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,663
Hold on.
I have to take this.

329
00:19:29,763 --> 00:19:30,807
Where are you?

330
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:34,251
Me?
I am not at the office.

331
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,092
You're going to give me
a new one of these every week?

332
00:19:41,192 --> 00:19:42,451
Well, I--

333
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:44,463
I can't continue to--

334
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:45,891
Not without protection.

335
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,272
Nobody tells me when to work
and when to play.

336
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,754
I'm not being unreasonable, Zoe.

337
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,670
If you can't trust me,
we should be doing this at all.

338
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,637
Well, then, how do we
establish our trust?

339
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:02,501
I have been very discreet.

340
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,259
Oh, professional discretion, yes,

341
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:07,733
but this is new territory.

342
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,605
You have a camera on your phone.

343
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,916
Pictures...

344
00:20:23,016 --> 00:20:25,371
The kind I wouldn't want
my father to see.

345
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,634
Well, I'm going to need more than that.

346
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,741
Lie back.

347
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,421
Use your imagination.

348
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,869
I want everything packed for tomorrow.

349
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:17,518
- We checked already, dad.
- Oh, did you?

350
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:19,382
Those are my pink Nikes
on the kitchen counter?

351
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:22,365
And you, Autobot, what is Optimus
Prime doing under my bed?

352
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,058
He better transform himself

353
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,574
into your backpack before you
have to leave tomorrow.

354
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,007
Hey, dad?

355
00:21:31,107 --> 00:21:33,556
Is Christina coming back?

356
00:21:33,656 --> 00:21:36,647
Um, I don't think so, buddy.
No.

357
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:38,583
Oh, I liked her.

358
00:21:38,683 --> 00:21:40,585
Me, too.
She's cool.

359
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:43,360
Yeah, she is cool.

360
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,386
And you guys gotta brush your teeth

361
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:47,915
and then check the rooms again,

362
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,496
and then it's time for bed.

363
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:50,973
Got it, pumpkins?

364
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:54,047
Dad, you know I hate it
when you call us pumpkins.

365
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,992
Go before I turn you into a pie.

366
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,327
Peter Russo.

367
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,176
He's a drunk.

368
00:22:14,276 --> 00:22:16,633
He is at the moment,
a very functional one.

369
00:22:16,733 --> 00:22:18,093
Imagine if he was sober.

370
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,859
Even so, you run him for governor,

371
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,374
people are going to dig into his past.

372
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,752
Well, we turn that into
an asset, not a liability.

373
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:27,010
Here's who I was.
Here's who I am now.

374
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,780
You saw how they dismissed him
in three seconds

375
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,967
at the leadership meeting.

376
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:31,862
Patty Whittaker
is very open-minded,

377
00:22:31,962 --> 00:22:33,957
and I am very persuasive.

378
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:38,018
You think Russo even wants it?

379
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:40,270
Any kid who's made it
from the streets of South Philly

380
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,469
to the Capitol Rotunda is ambitious.

381
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,974
We just need to tap into that,

382
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,535
surround him with the best people

383
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:47,749
and then build the machine
and push the go button.

384
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,419
So you think he could win.

385
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:52,347
I think he can be a contender.

386
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,960
Okay, let's say we pull off
a miracle and he wins.

387
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,536
What do we gain by it?

388
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:01,035
Isn't it better to be holding
the reins in this race

389
00:23:01,135 --> 00:23:02,697
than watching from the stands?

390
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:03,969
You wife is on the phone.

391
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:05,903
Put her through in here.

392
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:07,537
I understand that Pennsylvania's
important for redistricting--

393
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,158
No, no, no, this isn't just
about this race, Doug.

394
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:11,981
Expand your thinking.

395
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:16,681
Who else is from Pennsylvania?

396
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:18,093
No, no, no, not in Congress.

397
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:20,447
The executive branch.

398
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:23,408
The vice president.

399
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:28,450
Hello, my dear. Nancy had my tux
dry-cleaned so I won't embarrass--

400
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,017
The Cotesworth cancelled on us.

401
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,098
I'm leaving right now.
I'll come get you.

402
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:35,123
I've got to go.

403
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:36,246
What's going on?

404
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,652
The hotel, for tonight's gala.

405
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:40,442
They refused to let Claire
into the ballroom

406
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:43,691
because their employees are union.

407
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:44,929
Spinella.

408
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,292
Yeah, he can go after me all he wants,

409
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,938
but to go after my wife?

410
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,313
No class.
Meet me at the Cotesworth.

411
00:23:50,413 --> 00:23:51,980
You got it.

412
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,140
Why can't we just move it
to another place?

413
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,696
I looked into that.
Everything's booked.

414
00:23:56,796 --> 00:23:58,501
You have to reserve these
things weeks in advance.

415
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:00,873
I've got Stamper online looking
for another venue somewhere.

416
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:03,151
Francis, the delivery trucks
are already at the Cotesworth.

417
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,472
I can't have people showing
up at a different place

418
00:24:05,572 --> 00:24:06,893
in case they don't get the email.

419
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:08,415
This is my fault.
I feel awful.

420
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,812
There's a half a million
on the line here.

421
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:11,580
I realize that.

422
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,218
And I can't keep having my work

423
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,612
take these hits on behalf of yours.

424
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:16,501
It's more than just an inconvenience.

425
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:18,764
I know.
We'll solve it.

426
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,798
- Hey, I just got your email.
- What did you think?

427
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:30,234
You don't have to send me
things before you post.

428
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:31,979
Oh, I thought you might want
to take a look.

429
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,332
The goal here is
for everyone to post things

430
00:24:33,432 --> 00:24:35,059
faster than I have
a chance to read them.

431
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,842
If you're satisfied with the
article, just put it up.

432
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,234
- Okay.
- Are you satisfied?

433
00:24:40,334 --> 00:24:41,286
I think so.

434
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:43,019
Okay, you are or you aren't.

435
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,352
Whatever hoops the Herald made
you jump through--

436
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:47,181
- I know.
- ...Let them go.

437
00:24:47,281 --> 00:24:49,307
It's okay to be opinionated, Zoe,

438
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,714
and it's okay to go outside
to get your hands dirty.

439
00:24:51,814 --> 00:24:54,523
You're no longer tied to a desk.

440
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:55,688
Or that pillow, for that matter.

441
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:57,052
I'm not going to post it.

442
00:24:57,152 --> 00:24:58,820
Midterm predictions--
they're not news.

443
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,886
They're bullshit.

444
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:01,456
Well, I agree.

445
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:03,851
I can do better.

446
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,456
I think you can.

447
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:08,225
Feel free to blow my mind.

448
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:19,037
If we do this event,
the whole staff walks out.

449
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,658
I've got 300 guests--

450
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,746
You signed a contract with my wife.

451
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,337
We'll refund your wife's organization

452
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:26,222
and pay for whatever the costs
of moving the event

453
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:28,104
to a more appropriate venue.

454
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,718
And we would have to refund a half
a million dollars in donations.

455
00:25:30,818 --> 00:25:32,296
Can you pay for that, too?

456
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:34,428
Because I'm pretty sure there's
cause for damages here.

457
00:25:34,528 --> 00:25:36,589
I truly apologize, sir.

458
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:38,012
Who's your boss?

459
00:25:38,112 --> 00:25:39,494
I spoke with the owners,

460
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:41,138
and they authorized me to do
what I think is best.

461
00:25:41,238 --> 00:25:43,146
And do they realize
that they are shutting the door

462
00:25:43,246 --> 00:25:45,595
on 41 members
of the United States Congress?

463
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,749
Yes, sir, they do.

464
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,032
I had to make a very hard judgment call.

465
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:52,230
Well, I seriously question
your judgment.

466
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,308
You know, word travels fast
in this town.

467
00:25:54,408 --> 00:25:56,592
All those luncheons
and conventions and dinners.

468
00:25:56,692 --> 00:25:59,197
It's going to be a shame to
lose all that work. Isn't it?

469
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:01,554
Congressman, you are absolutely right,

470
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,055
but if my staff walks out,
I--

471
00:26:03,155 --> 00:26:06,332
Please understand
the predicament I'm in.

472
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,488
I got an idea.

473
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:09,056
I know what we're going to do.

474
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:12,046
Honey, they're not going
to let us have it inside.

475
00:26:12,145 --> 00:26:14,515
We're going to have it right here
on their front steps, picnic style.

476
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:15,770
What do you need from me?

477
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,337
I need your manpower.

478
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:18,603
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

479
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:25,070
Okay, everybody, stop what
you're doing, and listen up.

480
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:28,855
Yeah.

481
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:30,833
Oh, hey, Frank.

482
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:36,452
- How soon?
- About three hours.

483
00:26:36,552 --> 00:26:38,467
- How many people we talking?
- Just 300.

484
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,506
The florist is going to send
over whatever he has.

485
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:41,648
Great.

486
00:26:41,748 --> 00:26:43,175
Francis, where are we with food?

487
00:26:43,275 --> 00:26:44,818
I've got hotdogs, pizzas,
and soul food coming,

488
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:46,132
maybe something else.

489
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:47,901
Girls, here's what I want.

490
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:50,559
I want four bars, two on each level.

491
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,036
The food can go there.
The silent auction goes here.

492
00:26:53,135 --> 00:26:55,189
Oh, and cancel the string quartet.
Let's get a DJ.

493
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,287
Doug, how are we on booze?

494
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:57,612
- Kegs are on the way now.
- Great.

495
00:26:57,712 --> 00:26:59,422
Oh, and call Denise at the office

496
00:26:59,522 --> 00:27:01,998
and have her bring every
donation envelope she can find.

497
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,871
Okay, messages, people.

498
00:27:07,954 --> 00:27:09,333
Congressman Russo's office.

499
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:12,162
Yes, can you hold one minute?
Thank you.

500
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:13,983
Congressman, people keep
calling about the shipyards.

501
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,414
We don't know what to tell them.

502
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:16,732
We just say we'll give you the message.

503
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:18,297
- Keep saying that.
- Here they are,

504
00:27:18,397 --> 00:27:19,897
the messages and all the emails
we've gotten, too.

505
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:22,039
You want me to--
Have a good night.

506
00:27:24,952 --> 00:27:26,047
Who did we reach?

507
00:27:26,147 --> 00:27:28,270
Herald, The Times, USA Today.

508
00:27:28,371 --> 00:27:30,429
All right, I want affiliate
stations and cable news.

509
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:31,649
I want satellite trucks out there.

510
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:32,727
I want this on live TV.

511
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:34,011
Okay, I'm on it.

512
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,372
You can't do this here.

513
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:38,694
Zoe, 8:00 P.M. tonight,
Hotel Cotesworth.

514
00:27:38,794 --> 00:27:41,033
Benefit for my wife's charity.

515
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:44,742
No, wash your face
and let your hair down.

516
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:46,298
This is work and play.

517
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,815
See you.

518
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,377
I can tell you right now
I'm going to need two dozen.

519
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,066
Paul, I'm going to need those
by tomorrow, okay?

520
00:27:58,166 --> 00:28:00,720
Your guests are your problem,
not mine, Julian.

521
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,728
I'll close the gate.

522
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:05,256
You know, I'm no expert in fire code,

523
00:28:05,356 --> 00:28:07,183
but I would imagine that
locking your guests in

524
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,472
is a bigger violation than
having them walk around us.

525
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:11,997
This is trespassing on private property.

526
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,169
You're breaking the law.

527
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:14,236
Right, okay.

528
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:19,011
Let me get Barney Hull
on the phone here for you.

529
00:28:20,514 --> 00:28:22,017
Here you go.

530
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,087
It's ringing.

531
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:24,412
Who's Barney Hull?

532
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:26,221
The police commissioner.

533
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,104
No? Okay.

534
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:29,821
You'd rather talk to him
in person, that's great.

535
00:28:29,921 --> 00:28:31,132
He's coming to the party.

536
00:28:31,232 --> 00:28:33,065
I'll be sure to introduce him to you.

537
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,866
Thanks for your hospitality.

538
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,337
Bar comes over here.

539
00:28:39,437 --> 00:28:40,854
Put all that booze that way.

540
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,426
What do you want me to do?

541
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,120
I can't lock the gates, and they've
got the police on their side.

542
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,637
Unbelievable.
Hold on.

543
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:53,890
Cassandra,

544
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,007
I need 200 teachers

545
00:28:55,106 --> 00:28:57,312
at the Cotesworth Hotel right now.

546
00:28:57,412 --> 00:28:58,571
I need a full picket.

547
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,055
200? I don't know
if we can get that--

548
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,821
I don't want to hear it.
Just get it done.

549
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,540
I don't give a fuck if they're
teachers or not, frankly.

550
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,097
Just get me 200 bodies.

551
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:07,025
You know, call the teamsters.
Maybe they'll help us.

552
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,659
We'll give them glasses if we have to.

553
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,768
Tell the guys to look smart.

554
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:11,296
Charlie, get off the phone.

555
00:29:11,396 --> 00:29:13,347
I need signs right now,
at least a hundred.

556
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:14,979
You know what?
Let them set it up.

557
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,742
It's actually better for us that way.

558
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,461
This way they can't hide from us.

559
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:20,684
You've put me in a terrible situation.

560
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:24,220
Oh, you did?

561
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,484
...British accent.

562
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,231
Thank you very much for all your help.

563
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:41,696
Much appreciated.

564
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:43,216
Here, we got
the signs right here.

565
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,614
Let's hand them out fast.

566
00:29:44,714 --> 00:29:47,117
Everybody single file
right down the street.

567
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:51,075
This way, that way.
Okay?

568
00:29:57,473 --> 00:29:59,433
Well, at least he spelled it right.

569
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:01,937
Teachers protesting

570
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:03,661
the education reform and achievement act

571
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:05,952
have descended upon the Hotel Cotesworth

572
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:07,163
in Washington, D.C.

573
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:09,968
Union lobbyist Martin Spinella

574
00:30:10,067 --> 00:30:11,293
organized the demonstration.

575
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:13,348
Teachers deserve respect!

576
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:15,022
Teachers deserve respect!

577
00:30:21,593 --> 00:30:23,097
Now, I knew you'd show up.

578
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,393
You bring that beautiful wife
of yours? Hello...

579
00:30:25,493 --> 00:30:26,775
Pleasure.
Thank you for coming.

580
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:28,950
Come on in.
The drinks are on the house.

581
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,724
Felicity.

582
00:30:31,824 --> 00:30:34,565
Spinella got us shut out by the union,

583
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:36,628
so we had to have the party
out here on the steps.

584
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:38,423
I'll take you up to a bar right now.

585
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:39,569
Thank you for coming.

586
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,505
Thank you. Welcome.

587
00:30:41,605 --> 00:30:43,515
Teachers, yes!
Unions, yes!

588
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,074
Hi. Great.

589
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,231
Thanks again so much for coming.

590
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:43,992
Adam's here.

591
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:48,984
You came.

592
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:52,649
Looks wonderful.

593
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:54,301
You're going to have to move over,

594
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:57,411
because I have to serve
this wonderful couple myself.

595
00:31:57,511 --> 00:31:58,856
This is fabulous.

596
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:00,663
Only Claire could've thought of this.

597
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:02,927
I don't suppose you have
anything single-malt back there.

598
00:32:04,435 --> 00:32:07,856
Frank, it's worth every penny
to see you on keg duty.

599
00:32:07,956 --> 00:32:11,462
Well, then don't you think this is
worth just a few extra pennies?

600
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,227
Oh, let's break out
the checkbook, Charles.

601
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,814
Did you RSVP?

602
00:32:15,914 --> 00:32:17,746
I assumed it didn't matter.

603
00:32:17,846 --> 00:32:19,053
It doesn't.

604
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,762
I'm glad you're here.

605
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:23,625
When I heard your message.

606
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,730
You know, I shouldn't
have left that, Adam.

607
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,966
Why not?

608
00:32:31,194 --> 00:32:33,024
Maybe we should talk at some point.

609
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:36,329
Make that check with
a lot of zeroes, won't you?

610
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:38,727
There we are.

611
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:46,142
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

612
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:48,188
Cheers.

613
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm going to ask a huge favor
of you since you're here.

614
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,970
You want to put me to work.

615
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,579
Yes, please.

616
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,386
- My pleasure.
- Come.

617
00:32:57,486 --> 00:32:59,103
So these are
some wonderful photographs

618
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:02,048
- by an amazing photographer--
- Gillian.

619
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:05,580
Adam Galloway, nice to meet you.

620
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,973
And this is the photographer himself.

621
00:33:09,914 --> 00:33:11,666
Freddy.

622
00:33:13,194 --> 00:33:15,596
I just wanted to thank you so much.

623
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:16,648
Such a success.

624
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:18,545
My pleasure.
My pleasure.

625
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:19,609
He's the best.

626
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:20,973
I see Adam's here.

627
00:33:21,074 --> 00:33:22,538
I didn't know he was coming.

628
00:33:22,638 --> 00:33:24,099
- Well, guess what I got.
- What?

629
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,822
Another check from the Holburns

630
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,545
for $60,000.

631
00:33:31,115 --> 00:33:33,242
Come on, praise me like you should.

632
00:33:34,956 --> 00:33:36,540
If Frank Underwood and
the United States Congress--

633
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,344
Hi, my name is Zoe Barnes.
I'm with Slugline.

634
00:33:38,444 --> 00:33:40,716
...Dismantle the
rights of the American teacher?

635
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:43,607
Unions, yes!
Teachers, yes!

636
00:33:43,707 --> 00:33:46,446
Hi.
Why do you protest here?

637
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:48,346
And Congress has to take this seriously.

638
00:33:48,447 --> 00:33:50,389
We're here for the teachers.

639
00:33:50,489 --> 00:33:51,571
We're here.

640
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:53,179
Thank you.
Thank you.

641
00:33:54,714 --> 00:33:56,136
We're not asking for the world,

642
00:33:56,236 --> 00:33:58,323
and Congress needs to step up
and get this done.

643
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:12,830
Excuse me.

644
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,833
That dress looks familiar.

645
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:19,440
It's the one I wore to the symphony.

646
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,264
Oh, yes, mutual admiration society.

647
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:23,146
That's right.

648
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:25,270
So what do you have for me?

649
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,737
What do you mean?

650
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:28,666
Well, you're surrounded
by Washington's elite.

651
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:30,054
Are you saying you've overheard nothing

652
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:31,742
that could be useful to either of us?

653
00:34:31,842 --> 00:34:33,217
I'm covering the protest.

654
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:35,146
The rest of the world
is covering the protest.

655
00:34:35,247 --> 00:34:36,616
You may not have noticed,

656
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:38,505
but you're the only journalist
inside the party.

657
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:39,896
I've been feeding you plenty.

658
00:34:39,996 --> 00:34:42,561
Information is a two-way street,
Miss Barnes.

659
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,875
- Hello.
- Claire, this is Zoe Barnes.

660
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:46,296
You met her one night at the house.

661
00:34:46,396 --> 00:34:47,327
Yes, I remember.

662
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:49,021
You work for the Herald, right?

663
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:50,129
Not anymore.

664
00:34:50,229 --> 00:34:51,494
I actually work at Slugline now.

665
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:52,692
I've heard of it.

666
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,177
You read it, don't you, Francis?

667
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,657
Religiously.

668
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:58,608
Well, you seem like a very
ambitious young woman.

669
00:34:58,708 --> 00:34:59,730
I like that.

670
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,422
Doing my best.

671
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:03,755
It's good to see you again.

672
00:35:03,855 --> 00:35:05,177
Please enjoy yourself.

673
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,494
I will. Thank you.

674
00:35:06,594 --> 00:35:08,142
Take care, Miss Barnes.

675
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:32,290
...On the steps,

676
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,492
and she looks gorgeous,

677
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:35,019
but really she's thinking,

678
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,746
when can I go the fuck home?

679
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:43,393
- I'm off.
- Already?

680
00:37:43,493 --> 00:37:45,880
I've done my duty, I believe.

681
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,216
Oh, you know me.

682
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:50,128
Always have to be the first
to leave a party.

683
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:51,374
How much did you raise?

684
00:37:51,474 --> 00:37:54,573
$750,000.

685
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:55,732
80 of that was your photographs.

686
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:57,178
Fantastic.

687
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:59,188
Write a check for 250,
we'll break a million.

688
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:03,886
Nice try.

689
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:05,625
Thank you for coming.

690
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:08,514
And everything that you did.

691
00:38:13,356 --> 00:38:15,635
Call me sometime.

692
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,430
I will.

693
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,876
So what does a clean water gala

694
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:22,297
have to do with teachers' unions?

695
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:24,677
Well, we have
over 50 members of Congress

696
00:38:24,777 --> 00:38:26,179
gathered in one place.

697
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:27,862
But the fact that
these members of Congress

698
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:30,605
are promoting pouring money
out of the country

699
00:38:30,705 --> 00:38:32,344
while neglecting their teachers at home

700
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:33,940
is precisely the problem.

701
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,848
But this is private money,
not public tax dollars, so...

702
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,543
But we're not protesting the cause.

703
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:41,652
We're protesting the Congressmen
and women themselves.

704
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,425
Are these even teachers picketing?

705
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:44,653
Well, sure, some of them.

706
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:45,893
And some of them
are people in--

707
00:38:45,993 --> 00:38:47,951
Excuse me.

708
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:49,378
Frank.
What are you--?

709
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:51,675
Don't take the food.
We'll feed you later.

710
00:38:51,775 --> 00:38:53,588
Marty, you know that old saying.

711
00:38:53,688 --> 00:38:55,017
The most dangerous spot in the world

712
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:56,539
is to come between
a teamster and free food.

713
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:58,835
Don't take the food.
We're feeding you later.

714
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:01,973
- I'll take it.
- She'll take it.

715
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,745
Who else is hungry?

716
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:06,689
- There you go.
- Pass it back.

717
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:09,772
Plenty more coming, guys.

718
00:39:09,872 --> 00:39:11,628
I know you've all
been out here for hours.

719
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:12,976
Thank you, Freddy.

720
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:17,318
The best ribs in D.C.

721
00:39:17,418 --> 00:39:18,494
Marty, come on.

722
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:19,571
You said your piece.
You got on the news.

723
00:39:19,671 --> 00:39:21,018
Come and enjoy yourself.

724
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:22,376
I respect you, Claire.
You know I can't do that.

725
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:24,308
Doesn't matter what side you're on.

726
00:39:24,408 --> 00:39:25,533
Everybody's got to eat.

727
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:26,651
You can have a plate of ribs.

728
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:27,648
Yes, you can. Come on.

729
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:28,894
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

730
00:39:28,994 --> 00:39:30,175
Thank you, Claire, but I cannot.

731
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:31,577
You can do it.
Come on, Marty. Come on.

732
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:33,141
Thank you, I can't.
Thank you. Thank you.

733
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,534
Freddy's.
You should go to Freddy's.

734
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,675
Several dozen union sympathizers

735
00:39:45,775 --> 00:39:47,751
led by labor lobbyist Martin Spinella

736
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:49,464
attempted to disrupt the gala.

737
00:39:49,564 --> 00:39:51,225
They need to step up to the plate

738
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:53,312
and take care of our teachers
and our children.

739
00:39:53,412 --> 00:39:56,004
The protest dissipated
when fundraiser attendees

740
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,785
offer food and drink to picketers.

741
00:39:57,885 --> 00:39:59,749
Doesn't matter
what side you're on.

742
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:01,015
Everybody's gotta eat.

743
00:40:01,115 --> 00:40:02,539
Turn it off.

744
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:05,081
It is unclear whether
the protest will continue.

745
00:40:05,181 --> 00:40:07,453
What now?

746
00:40:12,957 --> 00:40:17,074
Call the union leadership
and the chapter presidents.

747
00:40:17,175 --> 00:40:18,826
See if they're ready
to pull the trigger.

748
00:40:18,926 --> 00:40:22,465
If they are, we strike
at midnight tomorrow.

749
00:40:48,557 --> 00:40:50,795
You were extraordinary.

750
00:40:50,896 --> 00:40:52,177
Tomorrow, people who weren't there

751
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:54,966
are gonna lie and say they were.

752
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:57,292
What are you reading?

753
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:03,087
She can write.

754
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,121
She can.

755
00:41:06,396 --> 00:41:09,167
And you can raise money.

756
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:12,212
Always for a good cause.

757
00:41:12,312 --> 00:41:14,699
Thank you.

758
00:41:32,917 --> 00:41:35,686
Wait in the car, please.

759
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:39,306
Hold on.
I know who that is.

760
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:46,972
Hello, Peter.

761
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:52,835
I am starving.
I forgot to eat.

762
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:54,831
Would you like something, Peter?

763
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:56,585
No. Thanks.

764
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:57,692
You should eat.

765
00:41:57,792 --> 00:41:59,138
Don't fight. She'll win.

766
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:00,333
I will.

767
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,514
Okay. Yes.

768
00:42:02,614 --> 00:42:03,775
You want some coffee?

769
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:05,341
Yes. Thanks.

770
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:08,576
Do you have any children?

771
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:13,451
Two.
A son and a daughter.

772
00:42:13,552 --> 00:42:15,146
Married?

773
00:42:15,246 --> 00:42:17,804
Divorced.

774
00:42:17,904 --> 00:42:19,382
What are their names, your kids?

775
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,513
Um, Sarah, she's 11,

776
00:42:21,613 --> 00:42:24,083
and Kevin is eight.

777
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:26,204
Do you have any pictures?

778
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:34,615
Fuck!
I lost my phone.

779
00:42:34,715 --> 00:42:36,630
I--sorry. I should--
uh, I gotta go.

780
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,731
Peter, sit down.

781
00:42:37,831 --> 00:42:39,179
You're gonna enjoy your sandwich,

782
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:41,532
have some coffee, and stay the night.

783
00:42:44,198 --> 00:42:46,885
Milk and sugar?

784
00:42:46,985 --> 00:42:49,647
Black.

785
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:50,773
Some fresh towels.

786
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,731
There should be soap and toothpaste,

787
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:55,139
everything you need in the bathroom.

788
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,946
Thank you so much for doing this.

789
00:42:57,046 --> 00:42:59,335
Oh, it's nothing.
Sleep well.

790
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:09,817
What's going on, Peter?

791
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:14,804
Talk to me.

792
00:43:18,077 --> 00:43:20,913
You think fresh towels changes anything?

793
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:26,693
Changes what?

794
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:30,426
The shipyard.

795
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:32,350
If I was home and you pulled that shit,

796
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,372
I'd beat the fuck out of you.

797
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:38,863
I would crack your skull
on the pavement.

798
00:43:38,963 --> 00:43:40,382
That's why I came over here today,

799
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:43,658
to fuck you up for what you made me do.

800
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:45,426
I don't care how nice
you're being to me.

801
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:46,653
I don't give a shit.

802
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:50,019
I'm gonna wake up tomorrow...

803
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:52,501
and all these people...

804
00:43:57,078 --> 00:44:00,705
all my friends...

805
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:03,570
are still fucked.

806
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:06,603
And I'm still fucked.

807
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:11,457
You fucked all of us.

808
00:44:11,557 --> 00:44:14,533
But I'm gonna get blamed for it.

809
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:17,855
So now I have to carry
that weight on my shoulders.

810
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,790
You fucked me, Frank.

811
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,135
I shouldn't have let you do it,
but I did.

812
00:44:49,998 --> 00:44:52,792
Are you done now?

813
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:56,925
Get up.

814
00:45:00,677 --> 00:45:02,998
- No.
- I said get up.

815
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:06,460
And follow me. Now.

816
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:23,436
Get in.

817
00:45:23,536 --> 00:45:26,126
Take off your clothes and get in.

818
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:28,578
Do it. Now.

819
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:49,003
There was a D.N.C. meeting
earlier this week.

820
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:50,500
About the governor's race.

821
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,146
Your name came up
as someone we might want to run.

822
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,626
Aspirin. Go ahead.

823
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:03,164
Everyone in that room wanted
to cross you off the list.

824
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:04,744
I said no.
I stuck up for you.

825
00:46:04,844 --> 00:46:07,651
I said, "Peter Russo,
he's got potential.

826
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:11,878
He's young. He's capable.
He's going places."

827
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,690
I made them keep you in contention.

828
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:17,734
You're still on that list.

829
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:20,692
You show up at my house
in the middle of the night,

830
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:24,960
drunk, to whine,
to try to shift the blame on me

831
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,707
instead of taking responsibility

832
00:46:26,807 --> 00:46:30,264
for yourself and your own actions.

833
00:46:30,364 --> 00:46:32,926
Maybe they were right in that meeting.

834
00:46:33,026 --> 00:46:36,463
Maybe you are worthless.

835
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:41,547
I'm the only person
who believes in you, Peter,

836
00:46:41,647 --> 00:46:45,065
but maybe that's one too many.

837
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:47,768
The hot water will open up
your capillaries.

838
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:50,242
The aspirin you just took
will make your blood thinner.

839
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:52,282
It's up to you, Peter.

840
00:46:53,958 --> 00:46:56,482
Oh, and if you do decide
to take the coward's way out,

841
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,757
cut along the tracks, not across them.

842
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,427
That's a rookie mistake.

843
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:20,858
Morning.

844
00:47:20,958 --> 00:47:23,485
Morning.

845
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:24,695
You need a lift to the hill?

846
00:47:24,795 --> 00:47:26,385
I should go home and change my clothes.

847
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:28,760
No, no, we'll drop you.

848
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,719
Want some coffee?

849
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:43,292
Frank...

850
00:47:43,392 --> 00:47:45,761
One month.

851
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:47,016
Hmm?

852
00:47:47,116 --> 00:47:49,583
One month sober.

853
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:56,802
I can give you that.

854
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:59,594
Not for me. For you.

855
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:05,554
Has the seed been planted?

856
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:08,533
Only Peter can answer that question.

857
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:10,472
He has a choice.

858
00:48:10,572 --> 00:48:14,025
Will he wither or will he thrive?

859
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:16,835
Only time will tell.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
