1
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,954
What was that?

2
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,633
A faucet.

3
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,995
It wouldn't shut up.

4
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,316
Did you sleep last night?

5
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,630
No.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,032
I'll call Nancy and tell
her to call a plumber.

7
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,671
Absolute discretion.

8
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,080
Can I count on that?

9
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,429
Always.

10
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
Raymond Tusk.

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,469
The President wants to
tap him as the new VP.

12
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,950
You and I cannot
let that happen.

13
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,110
Why not?

14
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,999
Because a third of his fortune
is tied up in nuclear energy.

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,512
SanCorp does not
want a pro-nuclear

16
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,632
businessman in the White House.

17
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,076
Market is shifting toward
natural gas anyway.

18
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,437
But Tusk wants to stall
that shift or reverse it.

19
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,513
Vice President doesn't have
that kind of influence.

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,195
This one would. He and
Walker are very close.

21
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,161
And it's in neither
of our best interests

22
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,441
to see SanCorp's position in
the marketplace diminished.

23
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,832
What's the ask? Tusk won't
accept the nomination

24
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,434
if he thinks
his holdings are at risk.

25
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,719
SanCorp needs to initiate
a hostile takeover.

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,359
He's worth three times
what SanCorp is.

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,801
I'm talking about
the subsidiaries.

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,193
We go after the companies that
refine and ship the uranium,

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,999
the support system that...
Come on, Frank.

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,278
There's stockholders to take into
account, huge financial exposure.

31
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,560
We just need to distract him.

32
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,838
Send a few token salvos and
intimate there's more to come.

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,754
All I'm asking is that
you speak to your client

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,309
and see if this is something they
might be willing to consider.

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,953
The President
announces Tusk on Friday,

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,793
so we don't have a lot of time.

37
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,876
I'll make some calls.

38
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,155
Thank you, Remy.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,960
If he doesn't deliver, I'm
an invader without an army.

40
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,475
If he does,
I've got a fighting chance.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,037
I just didn't feel
that we could work

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,231
together constructively
any longer.

43
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,277
I think that's a perfectly
legitimate reason...

44
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,350
Of course it is.

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,878
But what you can't do is fire
someone for being pregnant.

46
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,390
Is that what she's saying?

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,080
Ms. Cole claims that you said,

48
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,070
quote, I need employees,
not mothers,

49
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,755
and, quote,
go focus on your baby.

50
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,797
Can I see that?

51
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,677
It's completely false. I...

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,232
I never said that.
She claims you did.

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,789
It's her word
against mine, right?

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,952
Well, juries are very sympathetic
with expecting mothers.

55
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,436
This is extortion.

56
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,160
We don't want this
going to trial, Claire.

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,319
You and your husband
are public figures.

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,113
This will result in
some very bad press.

59
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,511
I suggest we go back to them
with a settlement offer.

60
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
We need the arrest record.
There isn't any.

61
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,350
They let him go.

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,000
Then we need to know
who got him off.

63
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,799
If Underwood was involved,

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,793
we are talking abuse of
powers and corruption.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,394
I checked. There's no files,
no mug shot, nothing.

66
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,951
Then we need to find the
cop who pulled him over,

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,033
or somebody who saw him
come into the station.

68
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,157
But D.C. cops?

69
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,994
They look after each other.
We need to be careful.

70
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,355
Do you have any
sources on the force?

71
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,830
Not that I would trust
with something like this.

72
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,639
You know, Lucas started
out on the crime beat.

73
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,632
I can see if he knows anyone.

74
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,558
Would he help us? I don't know.

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,879
Maybe. Help out a competitor?

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,039
We stayed in touch.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,037
You've gotta be kidding me.

78
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,670
This town is way
too incestuous.

79
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,355
I know it's a lot to ask.

80
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,274
I'm still trying to wrap my
head around the affair, Zoe.

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,159
If you could just give me a
contact and maybe vouch for me...

82
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,072
Did you wait to bring this up
until now because you thought

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
it'd be harder
for me to say no?

84
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,915
What do you mean?

85
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,349
In bed, right after we...

86
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,353
You don't actually think I
would do something like...

87
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,635
It sure seems that way.

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,520
This is huge, Lucas.

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,353
I'm trying to avoid
fucking up what we have.

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,274
Whatever that is. And you're
making it really hard for me.

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,716
I don't know that I'll ever be the
kind of person that makes it easy.

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,554
I'm not looking for easy. But I
don't need to be reminded of him.

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,869
I can't erase what I did.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,275
I know you can't.

95
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,116
But this is really
fucking manipulative.

96
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,397
Did you mean what you
said the other night?

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,950
That you probably...

98
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,321
I don't know what to do when
I hear something like that.

99
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,558
That's why I was so quiet when
you drove me to the airport.

100
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
I was angry.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,554
I just blurted it out.

102
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,471
I wish I hadn't.
At least not like that.

103
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm not trying to take advantage
of you because you did.

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,559
He hasn't said a word. And
you haven't brought it up?

105
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,711
I just asked him if he was
still considering Tusk.

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,836
He said yes, but that he wanted

107
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,910
to speak to you first.
That's it.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,276
I wish we knew if
they'd spoken at all.

109
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,114
Well, he has his private line.
I can't track those calls.

110
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,074
Frank. Mr. President.

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,197
Tell me about St. Louis.

112
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,953
He's a hard man to read.

113
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,440
I did my best to probe him,

114
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,274
but I don't think I left any
wiser to which way he's leaning.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,670
I must say, though,
I think he is

116
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,116
by far and away
the best candidate.

117
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,430
Why do you say that?

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,557
Doesn't it make
sense for you to

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,791
nominate someone
you know so well?

120
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,111
I don't know him. That's why
I sent you to St. Louis.

121
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,032
Forgive me, Mr. President.
I didn't mean it that way.

122
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,635
I meant that
the world knows so well.

123
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,076
You, me, everyone
knows Raymond Tusk.

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,277
We don't need to convince
anyone of his worthiness.

125
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
But you said
he still seems ambivalent?

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,309
Which is why I think you should
make a personal overture.

127
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,437
Invite him to the White House.

128
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,670
Well, I don't want
to appear desperate.

129
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,876
I agree with Frank.

130
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,917
Inviting him is
a very good idea.

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,874
If you're serious about Tusk,
you should wine and dine him.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Make him feel very special.

133
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,119
I'm sure we can find
time in the schedule.

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,316
Let's give him a few more days.

135
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,629
We have less than a week, sir.

136
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,632
I wouldn't wait
any later than Friday.

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,951
We can make Friday work, sir.

138
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,679
All right. Well,
see if he's available.

139
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,440
What are you doing?

140
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,320
Give me your phone. Why?

141
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,754
Just give it to me.

142
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Have you noticed
anything weird in here?

143
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,039
Stuff moved around?
Anything missing?

144
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,998
No. Anyone following you?

145
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,077
What did you find out?

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,434
This is serious, Zoe.

147
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,989
It goes way up, as high
as the Commissioner.

148
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,679
I had to beg my contact
at Metro to give me this.

149
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,794
No record of Russo
getting pulled over,

150
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,395
but he remembers there was a
call girl brought in with Russo.

151
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,154
That's a file on one of
her previous arrests.

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,635
I've investigated
police cover-ups before.

153
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,472
I got death threats for a year.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,878
Are you willing
to take that risk?

155
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,795
Yeah.

156
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,110
How long?

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,431
<i>The next board of directors
meeting is three weeks from now.</i>

158
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,034
That is too late. Remy, look,

159
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,240
the President is gonna nominate
Tusk in a week or less.

160
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,440
<i>I've urged Scott Cunningham
to call a special meeting,</i>

161
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,874
<i>but that doesn't
happen overnight.</i>

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,917
<i>There's a lot of machinery in
a corporate attack like this.</i>

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,832
I want to meet
Scott Cunningham myself.

164
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,877
<i>I'm not sitting you down with Scott.
You know the rules.</i>

165
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,077
These are extraordinary
circumstances.

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,591
<i>Frank, SanCorp's officers do not
meet with politicians, period.</i>

167
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,360
<i>You talk to me, I talk
to Scott Cunningham,</i>

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,874
<i>and vice versa.
That's how it works.</i>

169
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,561
All right, Remy.
Whatever you think best.

170
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
<i>I'll call you when I know more.</i>

171
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,035
Nancy!

172
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,433
Of all the things I hold in high
regard, rules are not one of them.

173
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,319
I will not place my fate solely
in the hands of a middleman

174
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,551
if I can go
directly to the supplier.

175
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,394
Book a flight to Atlanta. Tomorrow morning.
Let Meechum know.

176
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,755
Yes, sir.

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,550
She grew up in Lynchburg, Virginia,
went to Lorimer High School

178
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,791
until she dropped out
sophomore year,

179
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,473
and then after that,
there's no public record.

180
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,791
But all it says here is
that she was fined $300

181
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,997
for loitering on April, 2012.

182
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,674
One of us has to
go to Lynchburg.

183
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,991
Parents, classmates, teachers.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,196
I'll do it.

185
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,836
Okay. Well then, you and I
have to call escort services.

186
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,559
I'm willing to
lend a hand,
but not

187
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,313
by making cold calls
12 hours a day

188
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,198
just to get hung
up on by hookers.

189
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,350
Where was she arrested?

190
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,238
Connecticut Ave. 2460.

191
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,594
That's the address of the
District Grand Hotel.

192
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm not a fan
of surprise visits, Frank.

193
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,000
Remy wouldn't
arrange a meeting.

194
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,875
Remy Danton exists so
we don't have to meet.

195
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,280
I needed to speak with you.

196
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,638
There's a congressional
travel report

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,996
that puts you on
a trip to Atlanta

198
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,595
the same day I was pulled out
of an investors' briefing.

199
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,673
Those are the sort of
coincidences we want to avoid.

200
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,116
Were you briefing your
investors on Raymond Tusk?

201
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,830
Meechum can be trusted.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,998
Why would I be speaking
to them about Tusk?

203
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,992
I thought Remy filled you in.
No.

204
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,356
He didn't say anything about the
Vice Presidential nomination?

205
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,035
He didn't. And I have a feeling
I'd rather not be told.

206
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,474
Trust me, you want to know.

207
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,191
I've appeared in front of
grand juries before, Frank.

208
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,556
It's much easier when
you can tell the truth.

209
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,031
Please, don't put me in a
position where I have to lie.

210
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,873
If Tusk has
the President's ear,

211
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,236
you will see this administration
shift its support

212
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,074
toward nuclear energy and
away from natural gas.

213
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,436
His subsidiaries and his suppliers.
Go after them.

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,159
Frank, we should end this
conversation right now.

215
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,152
He will not accept the
nomination if his assets

216
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,118
are in a blind trust and he
can't fight off the threat.

217
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,270
Okay, we're done. Scott...

218
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,999
I don't wanna
hear another word.

219
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,998
Go back to the airport.

220
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,313
Figure out a good reason you
needed to be in Atlanta today.

221
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,834
You can pull over at the next corner.
I'll have my car pick me up.

222
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,755
<i>♪ When Sunny gets blue</i>

223
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,832
<i>♪ Her eyes get gray and cloudy</i>

224
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,513
One last one? Another.

225
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,476
<i>♪ Begins to fall</i>

228
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,474
Can I get
you something?
White wine.

229
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,596
Put that on my tab.

230
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,556
Thank you.

231
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,790
My pleasure.

232
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,758
They're about to
call last call.

233
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,400
That's all right. I don't
have much of a tolerance.

234
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,830
One more?

235
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,110
No. I'm good.

236
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,470
Hey.

237
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,872
You should head upstairs.

238
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,798
I was waiting for you.

239
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,957
Is that the new faucet? Yeah.

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,714
How'd it go?

241
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,358
Not good.
Remy's up to something.

242
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,113
He's not returning
my phone calls.

243
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,714
What can I do?

244
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,079
Tell me what you were dreaming.

245
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,838
Oh, it was so awful, Francis.

246
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,230
He's not letting
me sleep either.

247
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,911
Yeah. It's not him.
It's the kids.

248
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
I was playing with them
in the backyard,

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,390
and the girl was
climbing on the vines,

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,949
and I kept telling her to
stop and get down, and...

251
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,555
The vines just took hold of
her, and they wouldn't let go.

252
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,597
And she was screaming so loud,

253
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,514
and I just kept
pulling harder and harder,

254
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,751
and she just ripped in half.

255
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,670
Come here. Come here. Okay.

256
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,750
Ow!

257
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,995
Jesus!

258
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,041
You wait until after 2:00 in
the morning to return my call?

259
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,753
You trying to get my voicemail?

260
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,436
<i>The conversations we're having we
can't be having on cell phones.</i>

261
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,510
Where are you?

262
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,951
Claire is sleeping upstairs.

263
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,349
You shouldn't have gone
to see Cunningham.

264
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,591
He says you
didn't bring up Tusk.

265
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,717
You really think
he'd admit to that?

266
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,234
If we go through with this,
it's insider trading.

267
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,950
He didn't strike me as a man hearing
the news for the second time.

268
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,679
You want to believe
I'm playing games,

269
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,910
I can walk away
from the whole thing.

270
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,195
But I'm all
you've got right now.

271
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,910
I'm the one doing you and SanCorp a
favor, not the other way around.

272
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,841
I can tell when I'm being used, Frank.
I just want to know what for.

273
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
I don't use people unless I can
throw them away afterwards.

274
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,070
I'm trying to
strengthen our partnership.

275
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,474
Smells an awful
lot like bullshit.

276
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,554
Don't condescend.

277
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,358
Eight years
I worked on your staff.

278
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,361
And never once made it further
than your front doorstep.

279
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,549
Well, now I'm in
your living room, Frank.

280
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,160
It's not because of
what you taught me.

281
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
It's because I finally woke
up to what my value is,

282
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,676
and how undervalued I was,
slaving away for you.

283
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,071
This is business. Keep your
sob story to yourself.

284
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,313
I want to
maintain the influence

285
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,551
that I have worked to
achieve in the White House,

286
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,359
which translates
into the influence

287
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,199
that you have
in the White House,

288
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,634
through me.

289
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,999
I'll get in touch with
Scott again tomorrow.

290
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,912
See if we can push
this forward faster.

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,990
Thank you, Remy.

292
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,958
But you gotta let me
do this my way.

293
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,240
<i>The message was very clear.</i>

294
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,672
She doesn't want a settlement,
no matter what the figure.

295
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,433
Even if we give
her WorldWell back?

296
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,950
She wants to go to court.

297
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,195
They said we can expect a
formal summons next week.

298
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,630
This is ludicrous.

299
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,989
Her lawyers agree.

300
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,600
They'd much prefer a settlement,
too, but she's not playing ball.

301
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,396
I'll keep pushing them.
But in the meantime,

302
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
you should start
gathering all the

303
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,560
correspondence you
ever had with her.

304
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,036
Emails, notes,
every scrap of paper.

305
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,190
Okay. Thanks, Oliver.

306
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,476
All I'm trying
to do is find her.

307
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,959
I've got an arrest
record from April, 2012,

308
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,233
and I know she was pulled over
with a client in January.

309
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,998
That girl.
She had so much potential.

310
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,230
Why did she drop out?

311
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,396
Like I said, it's
an ethical breach for me

312
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,233
to discuss anything
that has to do...

313
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,198
I spoke to her parents.

314
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,480
Her father was very combative.

315
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,436
Was there trouble at home?

316
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,834
The father. Did he...

317
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,798
I won't speak about Rachel.

318
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,871
Can you talk to me about
your job in general,

319
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,796
the sorts of cases you deal
with in an abstract way?

320
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,077
When I'm concerned
about a student,

321
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,196
especially if there's possible
criminal activity involved,

322
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,115
it's my duty to
contact the DA's Office.

323
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,598
Now, if the DA pursues charges,

324
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,878
the student has to testify
against their own parent.

325
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,875
That's a difficult decision
for a young person to make.

326
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,075
Extremely difficult.

327
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,710
It could be easier to run away.

328
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,636
It's set for tomorrow.
Tusk lands at 7:30

329
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,155
and then heads straight to the White
House for dinner with the President.

330
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,192
Is it on
the official schedule?
No.

331
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,993
We need it to be.
Well, I can't do that.

332
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,120
The President specifically
asked that I leave it off.

333
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,350
Actually, that's good.
We can make that work.

334
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,159
Can you set up a meeting between
Birch and the President?

335
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,230
About what?

336
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,318
So he can give him his 2 cents
about who he will nominate.

337
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,629
I don't think we want
Birch getting involved.

338
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,801
He'll never get the chance.

339
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,990
What are you planning?

340
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,439
Can you set up a meeting for later today?
Yes or no?

341
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,994
I'm sure I can squeeze it in.

342
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,276
Good. I'll talk to Birch.
Get him on the phone.

343
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,600
This has to stay off the books,

344
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,880
just like the dinner with Tusk.

345
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,877
Okay. And finally.

346
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,118
Do you have a scheduler
that you can fire?

347
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,270
Janine,
I've got something for you.

348
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,350
What is this?

349
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,750
The President's OTR schedule
between now and Friday.

350
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,993
How'd you get this?
It doesn't matter.

351
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,037
Look who he's meeting
with this afternoon.

352
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,110
Bob Birch.

353
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
And look at Friday night.

354
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,752
Raymond Tusk. These aren't the craziest
meetings for him to be having.

355
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,718
Then why aren't they on
the official schedule?

356
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,441
He's considering them
for Vice President.

357
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,671
I'd say that's reason
enough to keep them secret.

358
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,797
Get this out, right away.

359
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,393
Mr. Speaker, I'm hearing
that you're gonna

360
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,193
be considered for
the Vice Presidency.

361
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,396
<i>Slugline is
reporting that you're</i>

362
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,596
heading to
the White House
right now.

363
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,433
I'm... No. You're not
headed to the White House?

364
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,240
Yes. The President
just wants my input.

365
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,515
But there's
the possibility that you

366
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,915
might be under
consideration yourself.

367
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,719
Not that I'm aware of.
Excuse me.

368
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,000
How did the schedule get out?

369
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,110
It got leaked, sir,

370
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,270
by someone in
the scheduling office.

371
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,555
On purpose? Accidentally.

372
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,757
A wrong attachment to an
email that went wide.

373
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,320
Well, whoever it was,
I want them out.

374
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,680
I already let them go.

375
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,396
Is Birch here yet?

376
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,550
He's waiting outside.

377
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,199
Well, cancel the meeting.
Tell him something came up.

378
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
I don't want to
feed the frenzy.

379
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,795
Yes, sir.

380
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,080
Give me
the private line,
please.

381
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,311
There are three satellite
trucks on my street.

382
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,752
I'm trapped in my own home.

383
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,752
Somebody in the scheduling
office fucked up.

384
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,752
<i>Are you seriously
considering Birch?</i>

385
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,910
Absolutely not.

386
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,878
We are losing control of
the process, Garrett.

387
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,075
Every time I've spoken to you,
you've never spoken back.

388
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,153
Although given
our mutual disdain,

389
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,556
I can't blame you for
the silent treatment.

390
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,550
Perhaps I'm speaking
to the wrong audience.

391
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,670
Can you hear me?

392
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,553
Are you even
capable of language,

393
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,154
or do you only
understand depravity?

394
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,713
Peter, is that you?

395
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,551
Stop hiding in my
thoughts and come out.

396
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,072
Have the courage in death
that you never had in life.

397
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,631
Come out, look me in the eye
and say what you need to say.

398
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,070
There is no solace
above or below.

399
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,796
Only us.

400
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,756
Small, solitary, striving,
battling one another.

401
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,631
I pray to myself, for myself.

402
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,550
Hello?

403
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,195
Who is it?

404
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,197
My lawyer said I shouldn't
be talking to you.

405
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,350
Mine said the same thing.

406
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,194
I'm not gonna
change my mind, Claire.

407
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,154
I made a mistake. I got upset,
and I acted impulsively.

408
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,233
I was the one
who made the mistake

409
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,000
by partnering with you
in the first place.

410
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,833
Well, then,
can we please both admit

411
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,116
that it wasn't meant to be, and
we can find an amicable way...

412
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,714
No, we can't.

413
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,433
What do you want?

414
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,830
To send a message.

415
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,273
Organizations like yours get
90% of the grant money,

416
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,194
then cozy up to corporate sponsors
who destroy the environment.

417
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,239
The things you're
claiming are lies.

418
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,710
I never mentioned
your pregnancy.

419
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,713
I got in touch
with Evelyn Baxter.

420
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,795
Remember her?
We had a long conversation.

421
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,439
It seems that
you have a history of

422
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,040
axing people
who disagree with you.

423
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,199
She'll be
testifying on my behalf.

424
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,114
So will eight of the people
that you made her fire.

425
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,352
If you want an apology, I'm
here to offer you one,

426
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,557
and to give you whatever
you think is fair.

427
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
This case is gonna
get national attention

428
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,994
because of who
you're married to.

429
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll have a platform to
say what I want to say.

430
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,240
That's worth more than
anything you could offer.

431
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,154
Listen, I know we have
different philosophies,

432
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,234
but what we're trying to achieve
is exactly the same thing.

433
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,717
We shouldn't be
fighting each other.

434
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,836
Do you feel that? The kicking?

435
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,319
I won't let
people like you fuck up

436
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,113
the world my child
has to live in.

437
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,953
If I have to tell
a few lies to do that,

438
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,636
at least I learned one
valuable thing from you.

439
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,719
<i>♪ Call me</i>

440
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,915

445
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,476
Glenlivet, neat.

446

<i>♪ Do my foolish
alibis bore... ♪</i>

447
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,913
The lawsuit?

448
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,190
And other things.

449
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,840
What other things?

450
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,835
You know,
I cannot guarantee you

451
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,752
that all of this
is gonna succeed.

452
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,513
Oh, it's not that.

453
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,438
You can tell me,
or I can keep guessing.

454
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,273
You'll roll your eyes.

455
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,070
Not at you.

456
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,629
I was thinking about
when one of us dies.

457
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,756
Whether it's you first or me...

458
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
Well, if it is me, and
I'm sure it will be,

459
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,880
you won't be alone for long.

460
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,437
No. I mean,
what will we leave behind?

461
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,878
We've accomplished
a great deal.

462
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,236
And I intend for us to
accomplish a lot more.

463
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,676
But for whom?

464
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,876
For each other.

465
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,760
But if we're not...

466
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,600
I'm being silly.

467
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,192
Have you ever been published?

468
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,760
Many times.

469
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,673
I guess that's
a stupid question.

470
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,956
You don't seem like
a starving artist.

471
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,759
Don't judge
a book by its cover.

472
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,838
You have a nice laugh.

473
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,310
Really?

474
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,390
It's very attractive.

475
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,796
Are you staying at the hotel?

476
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,840
You want to come up to my room?

477
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
That depends.

478
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,958
Well, how much
would that cost me?

479
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,634
That seems about right.

480
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,079
Close your eyes.

481
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,279
Put out your hands.

482
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,919
Now open them up.

483
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,598
I'm trying to find this woman.

484
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,911
If you make me
pull out my badge,

485
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,878
I have to take you in.

486
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,959
But I don't want to do that.

487
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,672
Let's not make a scene.

488
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,072
I used to see her around.

489
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,799
She left the business, though.
We haven't really kept in touch.

490
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,155
Any idea where she might be?

491
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,951
A friend of mine
saw her waiting tables

492
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,120
at a restaurant in Georgetown.

493
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,520
I guess the question I'm
trying to ask is...

494
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,795
Is it even worth that step?

495
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,716
The bottom line is that for a woman
your age, it's extremely hard.

496
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
Have you ever
had a miscarriage?

497
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,515
No. I...

498
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,274
I've been late before,
but I don't...

499
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,120
You know, I don't know.
I don't know exactly.

500
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,152
Have you had any abortions?

501
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,430
Three.

502
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,280
That can make it
more difficult.

503
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,992
I'm not trying to dissuade you,

504
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,756
but please make sure you think
long and hard before you decide.

505
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,911
But it's possible?

506
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,914
Assuming you and your husband
fit all the criteria?

507
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,673
Yes, it's possible.

508
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,516
Okay.

509
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,719
What? Well,
that's hardly my problem.

510
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,355
No, you get on it. It's...

511
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,714
I have to call you back.
What is it?

512
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,393
SanCorp's stock.

513
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,353
It's up 35% in
the last four hours.

514
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,958
It's all over
the financial news.

515
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,398
Tusk is making a play.

516
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,599
Get Remy on the phone.

517
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,272
Congressman Underwood
on line three.

518
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,234
I was just about to call you.

519
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,392
I need to meet with Tusk before
he sees the President tonight.

520
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,556
<i>He's already here.</i>

521
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,716
At the White House?

522
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,553
<i>He decided to come in
a few hours early.</i>

523
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,599
His plane landed
half an hour ago.

524
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,160
<i>Do you know where he is?
I don't know.</i>

525
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,311
<i>He had his own car pick him up.
I just found out.</i>

526
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,869
Remy's not in his office. I left
word there and on his cell.

527
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,151
Look, you need to call me the
moment you know where he is.

528
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,356
Okay.

529
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,796
It's just the lunch menu right now.
I hope that's okay.

530
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,553
Yeah. That's fine.

531
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,031
Your server will
be with you shortly.

532
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,634
Is Rachel working?

533
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,030
No. I don't think she's
scheduled till Sunday.

534
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,760
Stephanie will be
with you this afternoon.

535
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,995
Thanks.

536
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,001
Should we come back Sunday?

537
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,313
I'll be right back.

538
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,434
Excuse me.
Can I help you
with something?

539
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,151
Yeah. I was just
looking for the bathroom.

540
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,392
The bathroom is out this door,
to your right, down the hall.

541
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,598
That way? Thanks. Yeah.

542
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,832
Unless you want to use the
restroom in the office.

543
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,590
Who are you calling?

544
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,670
Rachel.

545
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
Rachel Posner?

546
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,839
My name is Zoe Barnes. I'm a
reporter at slugline.com.

547
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,710
I know about Peter Russo.

548
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,349
Rachel?

549
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,273
Come on, Rachel.

550
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,600
You shouldn't
have mentioned Russo.

551
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,790
She'll write back.

552
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,036
I wouldn't if I was her.

553
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,920
How much do you know?

554
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,673
That you were with him
when he was pulled over.

555
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,433
Who else knows? Just me.

556
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,673
I can keep it that way,
but I need more.

557
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,272
There is no more. You're lying.

558
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,516
Yeah, I was with him
when he got pulled over.

559
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,954
They took him away
and let me go.

560
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,520
I don't know
what happened to him.

561
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,832
He was never charged.

562
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,513
You know more than me, then.

563
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,671
No one ever came
to talk to you?

564
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,638
About what? To keep you quiet.

565
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,554
You don't kiss and tell
in that business.

566
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,074
Not even when
it's a congressman?

567
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,600
Especially when
it's a congressman.

568
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,478
Frank Underwood
never approached you?

569
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,360
Who's that?

570
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,830
You're too smart to
play dumb, Rachel.

571
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,670
You know who that is.

572
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,076
Name rings a bell.

573
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,391
I try not to follow the news.

574
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,800
Too many familiar faces.

575
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,314
How about Douglas Stamper?

576
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,153
Never heard of him.

577
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,835
I've told you
everything I know.

578
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,118
I know about
what your father did.

579
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,232
If you don't help me,
I'll write about Russo.

580
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,879
I'll write that
you were a prostitute,

581
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,316
and I'll write
about why you left home.

582
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,830
Go to town, bitch.

583
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,350
So?

584
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,352
She mentioned both
you and your boss.

585
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,036
What exactly?

586
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,150
She didn't say.

587
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,038
All she seemed to
know was that I was

588
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,913
in the car with him when
he got pulled over.

589
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,435
And you didn't
admit to more than that?

590
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,398
No. I said everything exactly
like you told me to.

591
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,470
You really think
I'd spill my guts?

592
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,550
Calm down.

593
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,040
Why didn't
you tell me he was gonna

594
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,640
hurt himself?
I never would've done it.

595
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,710
How could I have known?

596
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,836
I just want all this
to go away.

597
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,076
It will.

598
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,470
All of it.

599
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,280
I promise.

600
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,359
Do you want me to
order you dinner?

601
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,556
Where's Doug at?

602
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,915
I don't know. He left early.

603
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,392
Call him for me, will you?
Yes, sir.

604
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,400
Thirteen minutes from now,

605
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,880
Tusk will meet
with the President,

606
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
if he isn't there already.

607
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,756
You've never been an ally,
have you?

608
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,674
Pressing on with your
slow, incessant march.

609
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,910
Time would've killed Russo
if I hadn't,

610
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,837
just as it will
kill me someday.

611
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,274
Kill us all.

612
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,790
Sir, I just
got Doug's voicemail.

613
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,470
I wonder where he's at.

614
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,074
Well, maybe this is him.

615
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,716
Freddy?

616
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,591
Sorry, Frank.
I had to trade up.

617
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,474
SanCorp's a big fish, but
Raymond Tusk is a whale.

618
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,472
Can I get you something, Frank?

619
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,277
Nothing right now.
Thank you, Freddy.

620
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,312
I'll leave y'all to it.

621
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,152
I hope you don't mind
that Remy told me

622
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,237
about this little
secret of yours.

623
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,469
I wanted a place where
you'd feel comfortable.

624
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,311
Shouldn't you be
at the White House?

625
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,678
How could I pass up the chance to
eat the best ribs in Washington?

626
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,230
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

627
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,399
Remy told you about SanCorp.

628
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,998
As of closing bell today,
I own 3%.

629
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,516
By the end of next week,
I'll own over 10%.

630
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,995
Enough to make sure they
can't cause me any trouble.

631
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,036
A valiant effort, though.
I respect that.

632
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,714
So why are we here?

633
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,069
I told you I'd give you until
today to think things over.

634
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,634
I'm a man who keeps my word.

635
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,280
And I'm still not interested.

636
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,113
You wanted me to be more
specific back in St. Louis.

637
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,680
That would be a good start.

638
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,390
Why did Britain go to war
with China 150 years ago?

639
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,994
I'm in no mood for riddles.

640
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,830
Humor me a moment.

641
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,880
Opium.

642
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
It was bigger
than opium, Frank.

643
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,796
That was simply the excuse.

644
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,634
Peking wanted to call the
shots instead of the West.

645
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,712
It's the same problem
we're facing now.

646
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,440
But nobody wants a trade war,
much less a military one.

647
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,389
And what's your opium?

648
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,037
Samarium-149.
I need it for my reactors.

649
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,594
China controls 95%
of the world's supply.

650
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,194
And you're worried
about the imbalance

651
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,794
in our currency,
our foreign debt...

652
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,836
All of it.

653
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,071
You already have
the President's ear.

654
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,152
Trade tariffs are
controlled by Congress.

655
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,994
You have a lot more influence
there than Garrett does.

656
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,356
It's the reason I wanted you to
stay there in the first place.

657
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,080
And what exactly
would you want me to do?

658
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,232
Well,
that part I don't know yet.

659
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,789
We'll have to wait and see how
things play out with Chinese.

660
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,994
I've already told you I
will not do a blank check.

661
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,271
I must say I'm surprised,
Frank.

662
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,511
You have a reputation
for pragmatism.

663
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,152
And I also have avoided a reputation
for indentured servitude.

664
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,194
I never make an offer
more than twice, Frank.

665
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,591
Tell me now if I can count
on your cooperation.

666
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,799
You're not offering cooperation,
you're demanding tutelage.

667
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,033
So let me make you a proposal.

668
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,153
I am absolutely willing to
work together as equals.

669
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,275
I will take your opinions seriously,
just as the President does.

670
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,353
But I will not bind myself
to them in advance.

671
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,397
If that doesn't
interest you, fair enough.

672
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,871
Good luck finding a Vice
President in the next four days

673
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,798
who will prove
as pragmatic as I.

674
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,473
You can't purchase
loyalty, Raymond.

675
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,153
Not the sort I have in mind.

676
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,117
If you want to earn my loyalty,

677
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,311
then you have to
offer yours in return.

678
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,160
And if we can agree to that.

679
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,398
Well, you're a man
with imagination.

680
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,510
Wait.

681
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,511
If Stamper was there himself,

682
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,319
this goes much deeper
than a lost arrest file.

683
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,356
Well, let's think about this.

684
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,031
What did Russo gain him?

685
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,634
A mansion in Harrisburg.

686
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,040
Uh-uh.

687
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,679
Underwood thinks
bigger than that.

688
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,396
Then what?

689
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,676
I don't know.

690
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,035
He controls Pennsylvania.

691
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,793
He has influence
in the White House.

692
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,030
Walker needs the state
for re-election...

693
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,039
No. No,
it can't just be Walker.

694
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,200
The President backstabbed him for
the Secretary of State nomination.

695
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,401
It has to be something else.

696
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,559
The President would owe him.

697
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,473
But what?

698
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,960
They already meet once a week.

699
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,430
The Education Bill? I mean, what?
What specifically?

700
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,233
He could be after
the VP nomination.

701
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,194
That doesn't
make sense, though.

702
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,671
The VP slot is on the table
because Russo tanked.

703
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,390
Underwood wanted him to win.

704
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,238
Unless he didn't.

705
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,876
Maybe he wanted
Russo to self-destruct.

706
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,429
To force Matthews to run.

707
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,593
Exactly. And then next week,
when Matthews wins...

708
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,955
The President taps Underwood.

709
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,680
Mr. President.

710
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,629
Mr. Tusk.

711
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,354
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

712
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,430
Have a seat, Frank.

713
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,594
I have a confession to make.

714
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,192
Raymond and I have known
each other for years.

715
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,917
We don't publicize it, but he's
been a trusted advisor to me.

716
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,513
And I sent you to St. Louis so
he could spend time with you,

717
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,198
give me his 2 cents.

718
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,753
On what, sir, if I may ask?

719
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,240
Offering you
the Vice Presidency.

720
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,956
I told the President that,

721
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,831
in my humble opinion,

722
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,389
both he and the country
would be well-served

723
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,279
by a man as experienced,

724
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,070
intelligent, and loyal as you.

725
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,800
So I'm officially
asking, Frank.

726
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,959
Sir, I...
I don't know what to say.

727
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,749
Say yes.

728
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,630
Yes.

729
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,956
It would be a great honor,
Mr. President.

730
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,995
Meechum.

731
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,435
I take care of my own,

732
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,512
and you've proved yourself
to be very valuable.

733
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,997
I would like you to be
part of my security detail

734
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,958
once I get confirmed.

735
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,919
That's the Secret Service, sir.
I'm Capitol Police.

736
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,037
Then I'll put you
on the Secret Service.

737
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,078
If you're interested.

738
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,879
I'd be more
than interested, sir.

739
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,070
Good.

740
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,600
And I'm extremely grateful.

741
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,035
Keep being valuable.

742
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,873
That's the best way to
show your gratitude.

743
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,390
I will.

744
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,360
Mr. Vice President.

745
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,277
Did the plumber finally come?

746
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,754
No. I fixed it.

747
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,995
Francis.

748
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,393
So proud of you, Francis.

749
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,274
But I didn't do it alone.

750
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,831
I got here as
quickly as I could.

751
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,673
Is something wrong?

752
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,999
I need you to be completely
honest with me, Christina.

753
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,110
About what?

754
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,079
The other day, when I said
that you should tell me

755
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,516
if anyone from the press
started harassing you?

756
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,350
Zoe Barnes?

757
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,797
You said you wanted to talk
about something on the phone.

758
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,155
Oh, no. That can wait.

759
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,959
No. Come on. Tell me.

760
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,792
I... Earlier today...

761
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,237
The rowing machine,
I saw, is broken.

762
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,039
Oh, it's my fault.
The cable broke.

763
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,191
I haven't been able
to replace it yet.

764
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,477
What about going
for a run with me?

765
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,360
She's trying to smear
Congressman Underwood.

766
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,400
<i>It's a coordinated campaign
by everyone at Slugline.</i>

767
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,310
But she knew things.

768
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,950
Like what?

769
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,030
About Peter.

770
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,154
Something to do with Kern
losing the nomination.

771
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,430
And?

772
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,634
Want me to drive
alongside you, sir?

773
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,120
No. You stay here.

774
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,475
Yes, sir.

775
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,120
You ready?

776
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,350
Yes.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
