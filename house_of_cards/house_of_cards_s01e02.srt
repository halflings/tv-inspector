You know what I like about people?

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,852
They stack so well.

4
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:19,814
Let me get this for you.

5
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,735
- Want the paper?
- No.

6
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:27,862
This is too much.

7
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:28,686
It's not half enough.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,753
Thanks for opening up for me.

9
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:32,254
Any time, day or night.
You know that.

10
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,412
In a town where everyone's

11
00:00:34,413 --> 00:00:36,163
so carefully reinventing themselves,

12
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:37,498
what I like about Freddy

13
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:40,585
is that he doesn't even
pretend to change.

14
00:00:40,586 --> 00:00:42,545
Ooh. I'm late.

15
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,755
Every Tuesday I sit down

16
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:45,757
with the speaker and the majority leader

17
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:47,341
to discuss the week's agenda.

18
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:49,677
Well, discuss is probably
the wrong word.

19
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:51,512
They talk while I sit quietly

20
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,472
and imaging their lightly salted faces

21
00:00:53,473 --> 00:00:54,973
frying in a skillet.

23
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:36,200
Vasquez must be shitting herself.

24
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:38,452
Shitting herself,
or Walker is shitting himself

25
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,538
and shoveling his shit on her shit.

26
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:42,080
Bob, I'm planning on eating.

27
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,374
Do we have a backup on the docket?

28
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:44,792
You're on that, right, Frank?

29
00:02:44,793 --> 00:02:46,043
Yeah, I'm working
with my staff--

30
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:47,378
Republicans are gonna ram this

31
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,213
up our ass.
I would if I was them.

32
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:50,715
Why, even if we squeak it
through the house,

33
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,550
watch them mangle it in the senate.

34
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,176
- Or filibuster.
- Why, sure, if it looks anything like this.

35
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:55,636
I don't know why Walker's

36
00:02:55,637 --> 00:02:57,596
trying to tackle a charging elephant.

37
00:02:57,597 --> 00:02:58,848
It's madness.

38
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,516
Congressmen, sorry to interrupt,

39
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:02,100
but I saw you
sitting over here--

40
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,936
Remy. Gentlemen,
this is Remy Danton.

41
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:05,813
Remy, this is Speaker
Birch and Congress--

42
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:07,857
I'm well aware.
Mr. Speaker, Congressman.

43
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:10,150
Remy just made partner at Glendon Hill.

44
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,277
Glendon Hill?
Great team over there.

45
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:13,863
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:15,614
When was the last time
they added a partner?

47
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,115
It's been a while.

48
00:03:17,116 --> 00:03:18,784
Well, they know a winner
when they see one.

49
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:20,661
Remy was the best press
secretary I ever had.

50
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,329
Why did you let him go?

51
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,582
I didn't.
They stole him away.

52
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,000
What accounts do you have?

53
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,002
San Corp Industries is my main one.

54
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,754
I run that account now.

55
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,422
Anyhow, I'll let you get back to it.

56
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:32,423
Sorry again to interrupt.

57
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:33,507
No problem.

58
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,634
Very nice to meet you both.

59
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:38,470
- Nice.
- Lobbyists keep getting younger and younger.

60
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:41,098
He's probably making more
than all of us combined.

61
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:42,433
Gentlemen, this one's on me.

62
00:03:42,434 --> 00:03:44,268
I'm gonna track down that check.

63
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,979
Glendon Hill fronts San Corp Industries.

64
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,773
San Corp is deep into natural gas.

65
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:50,733
I don't give a hoot about natural gas,

66
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:52,276
but I have 67 deputy whips,

67
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,445
and they all need cash to win races.

68
00:03:54,446 --> 00:03:56,530
San Corp helps me purchase loyalty,

69
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,156
and in return they expect mine.

70
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,533
It's degrading, I know,

71
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:00,910
but when the tit's that big,

72
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:02,119
everybody gets in line.

73
00:04:05,915 --> 00:04:07,499
Tell them I'm on top of it.

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,001
I need more than that.

75
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:11,503
You are well aware
that I do not drop the ball

76
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,838
on things like this, Remy.

77
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:15,215
Promises, Frank.
Secretary of State,

78
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:16,592
Argentine and offshore
drilling contracts--

79
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,552
talk to me when I've solved the problem.

80
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,387
Don't waste my time when I'm
working on solving the problem.

81
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:21,513
When there's billions on the line,

82
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,765
I can't not show up.

83
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:24,182
Fine. Thank you
for your diligence.

84
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:26,060
Eight figures to you and the D triple C.

85
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:28,896
6 million to build that library
of yours in your name.

86
00:04:28,897 --> 00:04:31,148
- I know.
- Don't make them throw money

87
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:32,817
at your challenger next cycle.

88
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,318
You've made your point.

89
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,029
Have I? I hope so.

90
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,409
Such a waste of talent.

91
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,787
He chose money over power--

92
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:47,414
In this town, a mistake
nearly everyone makes.

93
00:04:47,415 --> 00:04:50,334
Money is the McMansion in Sarasota

94
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,586
that starts falling apart
after ten years.

95
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,506
Power is the old stone building

96
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:58,134
that stands for centuries.

97
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:01,470
I cannot respect someone
who doesn't see the difference.

98
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,807
What am I looking at?

99
00:05:04,808 --> 00:05:06,058
The Williams register.

100
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,434
- Williams?
- College.

101
00:05:07,435 --> 00:05:08,644
September '78.

102
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,104
And why am I looking at it?

103
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:11,396
The editorial.

104
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:18,029
Not that interesting.

105
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,280
Michael Kern went to Williams.

106
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,949
Check out the masthead.

107
00:05:24,368 --> 00:05:26,411
And then there's this.

108
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,832
It's thin.

109
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,043
The guy's a unicorn.
He pisses rainbows.

110
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,919
- You think we can get traction with this?
- I think you could.

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,379
Linda Vasquez is on the phone.

112
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,256
Ah, I'm surprised it took her this long.

113
00:05:38,257 --> 00:05:39,967
It's only 6 past 9:00.

114
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:41,886
Which means she read
the Herald 3 hours ago

115
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:44,555
and spent the past 2 1/2 getting
reamed by the president.

116
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,515
Tell her I'm on my way.

117
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,767
You were supposed to keep Donald in line.
You assured me that you--

118
00:05:48,768 --> 00:05:51,520
25 years he's been pushing
this particular agenda.

119
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,522
We got between the
mother bear and her cub.

120
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,107
It's a setback.
That's all.

121
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,692
On our first day in office.

122
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:58,485
Linda, I've worked with four presidents.

123
00:05:58,486 --> 00:06:00,487
Setbacks are a dime a dozen
with a bill of this size.

124
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:02,238
Frank, if you
can't control this--

125
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,158
I don't take well to being
micromanaged, Linda.

126
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:06,952
You want to do my job for
me and run the White House?

127
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:09,038
Good luck.
I won't stand in your way.

128
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,374
Okay, Frank. Fine.
This is yours now.

129
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,377
If this thing can't make it to
the floor in the first 100 days,

130
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:16,962
then I'll let you explain
to the president

131
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:18,505
why he lied to the American people.

132
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:20,007
I'm gonna get back to work.

133
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,425
Please do.

134
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,780
Well, we really should be
doing this on a Friday

135
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:43,948
instead of a Wednesday.

136
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:45,783
If we do it on a Friday,

137
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:48,119
- people have the weekend--
- Fine. We'll do it on Friday.

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,620
Is all the paperwork ready?

139
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:51,914
Some of the more senior
people are trickier.

140
00:06:51,915 --> 00:06:53,582
There's severance.

141
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,167
But we shouldn't run into
any legal issues.

142
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:59,004
No, no. We use at-will
employment contracts

143
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:00,296
across the board.

144
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:02,091
Well, get started first thing Friday.

145
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:05,177
I want all of the exit interviews

146
00:07:05,178 --> 00:07:06,470
done by lunch.

147
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:08,639
Claire, I just can't help but think

148
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,224
that this is a mistake.

149
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,934
We've discussed this already, Evelyn.

150
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:14,103
I know, I know,
but I just have to say it

151
00:07:14,104 --> 00:07:16,063
for the sake of my conscience.

152
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:19,108
I think that you are dismantling

153
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,944
what we have built
over the past ten years,

154
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:23,154
and I--

155
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,663
and I think the way you're handling this

156
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,250
is...is cruel.

157
00:07:36,251 --> 00:07:37,751
It's not easy, Evelyn.

158
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,754
But it's necessary.

159
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:44,300
You have always asked me
to be honest with you.

160
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,010
It's how we work together.

161
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,386
I disagree with something, I say it.

162
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:51,723
Well, I disagree 100%.

163
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:54,351
Please, Claire, don't do this.

164
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:56,645
I respect your opinion, Evelyn,

165
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,772
and I appreciate you sharing it with me,

166
00:07:58,773 --> 00:08:01,608
but I'm not going to change my mind.

167
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,529
Friday, then.

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,783
If that's what you want.

169
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,169
This is major reform,
a complete overhaul.

170
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,254
That would usually take months.

171
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:24,173
Well, we only have days, not months.

172
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,757
But think about the process.
We can't just change--

173
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:29,053
When I ask my colleagues, your bosses,

174
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:31,930
who are the smartest minds in education,

175
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,766
out of hundreds,
we arrived at you--

176
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,768
the six of you in this room.

177
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,562
Now, I realize it is a difficult task,

178
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,565
but we have the opportunity
to make history here.

179
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:45,485
And I want all of us
to make it together.

180
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,946
So good luck.
We're counting on you.

181
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:50,532
Page 1.

182
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:51,783
These bullet points

183
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,202
reflect the key planks

184
00:08:53,203 --> 00:08:54,912
at the center of our bill.

185
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:56,788
Get comfy.
This is your home

186
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,498
until we have a presentable first draft.

187
00:09:02,002 --> 00:09:03,962
Donald, what a morning.

188
00:09:03,963 --> 00:09:05,714
I have no idea how they got this.

189
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:07,174
I specifically told my staff

190
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,800
to destroy everything.
I can't imagine--

191
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,427
It doesn't matter how it happened.

192
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,596
We can't make it unhappen,
so we have to adapt.

193
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:14,681
Don't they realize
that this is a first draft?

194
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:16,516
All we have here really
is a perception problem.

195
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:19,103
We don't get a second chance
at a first impression, Donald.

196
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:21,772
You know that. Now,
look, I'm on your side,

197
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,982
but Linda is furious.

198
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:25,442
What's she saying?

199
00:09:25,443 --> 00:09:27,403
They want to point fingers.

200
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:28,570
At me?

201
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:30,155
I told her we cannot do that.

202
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,032
I mean, you are vital to this process.

203
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,659
I'm up to here with them,
Donald--

204
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,746
for lying, for turning
their back on you.

205
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:40,249
You know, I'm of a mind to say screw it.

206
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,293
I'll fall on this grenade myself,

207
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,544
just to piss them off.

208
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,255
Give me John king at CNN.

209
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:47,965
Wait, Frank.
This is not your fault.

210
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:50,008
No, we have to protect your reputation.

211
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,927
But you're the man that needs to
get the bill through the house.

212
00:09:51,928 --> 00:09:54,721
I will-- hang on.
I will assign it to one of my deputies,

213
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:56,974
quietly manage it, and help
guide you through the process.

214
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,683
I am not comfortable with this.

215
00:09:58,684 --> 00:10:01,353
Well, then what do you suggest we do?

216
00:10:03,189 --> 00:10:05,607
What a martyr craves more than anything

217
00:10:05,608 --> 00:10:07,109
is a sword to fall on,

218
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,902
so you sharpen the blade,

219
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:10,654
hold it at just the right angle,

220
00:10:10,655 --> 00:10:13,449
and then 3, 2, 1--

221
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,574
It should be me.

222
00:10:14,575 --> 00:10:15,826
It was my bill.

223
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:17,369
No. Impossible. Donald,

224
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,580
education has been your life's work.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,211
The truth is my heart
is not in this fight.

226
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:29,214
You know me. I'm not
a wheeler dealer.

227
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:30,882
I can put my mind to policy,

228
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,635
but I'm no good at this
brand of politics.

229
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:36,221
Well, if not you, then who?

230
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:43,854
It should be you, Frank.

231
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:46,231
You're formidable.
People respect you.

232
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,150
They will follow your lead.
Let me--

233
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:50,068
let me be on the sidelines for this.

234
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,908
Well, I could only
consider that as an option

235
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:01,163
if I knew that I could still
come to you for counsel.

236
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:04,416
Of course.
Whatever you need.

237
00:11:06,252 --> 00:11:09,921
Part of me is glad this got leaked.

238
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:13,758
Well, it would have been
better if it hadn't,

239
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,137
but at least people know where I stand.

240
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,224
Thank you, Donald.

241
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:21,850
Happy to do it, Frank.

242
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,984
He has no idea we've got
six kids in the next room

243
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,403
already working on a new draft.

244
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,905
Stamper! But why dampen
his mood by telling him?

245
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:36,407
We just gave him
a great gift--

246
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,367
a chance to fulfill his destiny.

247
00:11:38,368 --> 00:11:40,202
Write up a statement
for Blythe--

248
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,828
stepping aside, fresh ideas,

249
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,747
et cetera, et cetera,
and make it dignified.

250
00:11:43,748 --> 00:11:44,998
He's a good man.

251
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:47,543
Oh. And bring me
that Williams editorial.

252
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:54,508
After careful thought
and discussion with my staff,

253
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,676
I am relinquishing my management

254
00:11:56,677 --> 00:11:58,136
of the education reform act.

255
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:00,264
I hope to remain a part of the process,

256
00:12:00,265 --> 00:12:01,306
but I won't be working--

257
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:02,724
Why did you leak the draft?

258
00:12:02,725 --> 00:12:04,893
I'm not exactly sure how it got leaked,

259
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:06,853
but, uh,
it does represent--

260
00:12:06,854 --> 00:12:08,604
it came from your office,
though, correct?

261
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:10,107
Uh, we wrote it,
but I don't--

262
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:11,691
Who'll be managing the bill now?

263
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:12,692
Frank Underwood.

264
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,069
Was that your choice,

265
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,404
or did
the administration--

266
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:16,447
I feel very confident

267
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,573
placing the bill

268
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:18,990
in Frank's capable hands.

269
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,238
Ms. Barnes.

270
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,906
How very deep throat of you.

271
00:12:59,907 --> 00:13:02,826
Well, I can't help you
dispatch a president.

272
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:04,244
How about a senator?

273
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,079
The editorial on the Camp David accords.

274
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,373
"It is the opinion of this newspaper

275
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:10,501
"that President Carter demand Israel

276
00:13:10,502 --> 00:13:12,002
"withdraw all its citizens

277
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:13,629
from the Gaza Strip
and West Bank."

278
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,590
"Which it has illegally
occupied since 1967."

279
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:18,550
Illegally occupied.

280
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:20,010
That's quite an incendiary
quote, don't you think?

281
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,761
For an administration that says

282
00:13:21,762 --> 00:13:24,181
that the Middle East is its
top foreign policy priority.

283
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,474
Michael Kern?

284
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:27,767
Did he personally write the editorial?

285
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:29,685
He was the editor.

286
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,438
But did he write it himself?

287
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,192
Then there's no story.

288
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:38,694
I'm saying it's a question worth asking.

289
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,656
And if he denies involvement?

290
00:13:40,657 --> 00:13:42,199
He will. Let him.

291
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,409
This is a man trying to be confirmed

292
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,036
as Secretary of State.

293
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:47,745
Everything is a story.

294
00:13:47,746 --> 00:13:49,164
There's no direct link.

295
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:52,708
I can't get this past Messerschmidt.

296
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,421
Remember this moment
when you resisted me,

297
00:13:56,422 --> 00:14:00,676
when you said the words
"Then there is no story."

298
00:14:02,386 --> 00:14:04,596
Get a good night's
sleep, Ms. Barnes.

299
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:06,598
You have a big day tomorrow.

300
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:30,706
Francis?

301
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,302
What is this?

302
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,387
What does it look like?

303
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:47,138
But the basement is mine.

304
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,600
I know. It's not for me.

305
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,850
So who's it for?

306
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:52,060
For you.

307
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:53,811
There's a gym in the Capitol.

308
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,230
Which you never use.

309
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,274
Because I'm a tad busy
running the country.

310
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,484
But not at home, so now
you have no excuse.

311
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:00,652
I want it out.

312
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:02,028
Give it a try first.

313
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,238
Is this your subtle way

314
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,949
of saying that I'm out of shape?

315
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,284
No, it's my way of suggesting

316
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,868
you could be in better shape.

317
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,704
That sounds
both passive-aggressive

318
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:12,122
and condescending.

319
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,248
Just plain aggressive and true.

320
00:15:13,249 --> 00:15:14,666
Don't wait up for me.

321
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,126
Are you going running now?

322
00:15:17,377 --> 00:15:18,795
Yes, because I couldn't this morning.

323
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,171
I had an early meeting.

324
00:15:20,172 --> 00:15:22,924
Use the monstrosity.
It's freezing out.

325
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,718
You break it in.

326
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,265
It looks positively
medieval, doesn't it?

327
00:15:30,266 --> 00:15:33,310
And to turn my only sanctuary
into a fitness dungeon.

328
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:34,645
I won't have it.

329
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,105
It's a stretch.

330
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,856
We're not misleading anyone.

331
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:40,984
- He was the editor.
- Did you call for a comment?

332
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:43,111
I tried three times. The press
secretary said he'd get back to me.

333
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:45,113
- He didn't.
- What about research?

334
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:46,782
You couldn't find anything
to echo the editorial?

335
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,325
No quotes, no op-ed pieces?

336
00:15:48,326 --> 00:15:50,076
Don't you think if something
like that existed,

337
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:51,787
someone would have printed it by now?

338
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:53,204
Nobody else has this, Lucas.

339
00:15:53,205 --> 00:15:54,956
I don't think there's a story here.

340
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,833
I'm not saying there's a story.
All I'm saying

341
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,960
is that there's a question
that needs to be answered.

342
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,673
This is a nominee
for Secretary of State.

343
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:04,924
We have an editorial
on Palestine and Israel.

344
00:16:04,925 --> 00:16:06,343
Which he didn't write.

345
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,345
Which we don't know he didn't write.

346
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:09,805
Exactly.

347
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:11,014
We don't have to print it.

348
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:12,349
I could just scan the thing,

349
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,058
stick it on a site, and tweet the link.

350
00:16:14,059 --> 00:16:15,602
But if I did that,
some other paper might--

351
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:17,979
Whoa, whoa.
Don't be a bitch.

352
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,857
I'll talk to Tom.

353
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:22,734
That's all I was asking.

354
00:16:22,735 --> 00:16:24,611
We simply can't afford
to allow the--

355
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,154
We got a guy who's almost perfect.

356
00:16:26,155 --> 00:16:28,198
He's a libertarian drug fiend

357
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,741
- marinating in a mobile home.
- Shh.

358
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,493
I didn't agree with President Reagan

359
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:32,703
on many things,

360
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,162
but there was some merit

361
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,789
to the notion
of trickle-down economics,

362
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,332
and I feel there is much merit

363
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:40,752
to the idea
of trickle-down diplomacy.

364
00:16:40,753 --> 00:16:42,337
Those are my lines.

365
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:43,921
Vasquez must have given them to him.

366
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,799
...stalemate between
Israel and Palestine,

367
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,593
that success will trickle down

368
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:50,094
to a hundred other diplomatic dilemmas

369
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,971
between Muslims,
Jews, Christians--

370
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,807
I'm glad you brought up
Israel and Palestine

371
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:55,559
because just before we came on the air,

372
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,227
I received an advance copy of an article

373
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,895
that's going to be in tomorrow's

374
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,438
Washington Herald's front page

375
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,190
and was written by Zoe Barnes,

376
00:17:02,191 --> 00:17:04,150
and in it she quotes an editorial

377
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,152
that ran in the Williams
college register

378
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:09,197
when you were editor
back in September 1978,

379
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:10,574
which called the Israeli presence

380
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:12,033
in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,

381
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,828
quote, an illegal occupation.

382
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,663
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

383
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:18,832
Did you write those words,
"illegal occupation"?

384
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,792
No. I have
no memory of this.

385
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,627
But you were the editor of the paper.

386
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:24,087
Yes, but--

387
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,463
So it couldn't have gone out

388
00:17:25,464 --> 00:17:26,757
without your approval.

389
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:29,008
No, of course not,
but my staff--

390
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,719
somebody else usually wrote the, uh,

391
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,804
the, uh-- and then
we'd vote, and if--

392
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:34,222
Did you vote for it?

393
00:17:34,223 --> 00:17:35,390
Honestly, George, I can't remember.

394
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,558
It was 35 years ago.

395
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,059
So you're not sure

396
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,728
whether or not you
supported these words--

397
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:41,688
I can tell you without
a shadow of a doubt

398
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:43,565
I did not write these words.

399
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:46,234
But were they in line with
your thinking at the time?

400
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:48,820
This is ludicrous.

401
00:17:48,821 --> 00:17:51,281
That's all we need--
him laughing.

402
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:53,032
I know it was
a long time ago--

403
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,701
Nancy, get me Dennis Mendel of the ADL.

404
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:57,245
The Middle East is a vital
American interest.

405
00:17:57,246 --> 00:17:59,289
What you think about
the Middle East is relevant.

406
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:01,499
You can look at my voting record.

407
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,085
Every single vote has been
in defense of Israel--

408
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:06,087
So when did your views change?

409
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:07,422
What I'm saying to you
is my--

410
00:18:07,423 --> 00:18:08,590
What's important now, George,

411
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,341
is how I have voted

412
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,510
while I have represented
the great state of Colorado--

413
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,554
I understand that's your position,
but a lot of other people

414
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:16,139
are going to look at it
and think what you thought then

415
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,432
is relevant as well.

416
00:18:17,433 --> 00:18:19,016
Have you ever changed your views

417
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:21,102
- since college?
- I'm not the nominee

418
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,437
for Secretary of State.

419
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:24,773
Uh,
even if I did have--

420
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,065
It's golden.

421
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,358
This has not been my views--

422
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,777
It's a bull's eye.

423
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:30,821
What were you saying when you came in?

424
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,573
So, ahem, I found a guy

425
00:18:33,574 --> 00:18:35,283
who was on the college editorial staff

426
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:36,493
when Kern was there.

427
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:37,828
This burnout,

428
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:39,621
still pumping mimeographed manifestos

429
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:41,289
out of a trailer park in the Berkshires.

430
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,958
You're not planning on talking to him.

431
00:18:42,959 --> 00:18:44,542
Peter Russo.

432
00:18:44,543 --> 00:18:46,503
Good.

433
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:48,296
Sounds like a perfect match.

434
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,426
Dennis.

435
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:56,053
Any chance you're watching
Stephanopoulos?

436
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:07,315
You look sexy when you're improving

437
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:09,818
the lives of hardworking Pennsylvanians.

438
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,152
Is it the improving lives,

439
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:12,696
or is it these fetching sweat pants?

440
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:14,823
Move that computer out of the way.

441
00:19:14,824 --> 00:19:16,574
Let me see what that looks like.

442
00:19:19,744 --> 00:19:21,245
Yeah, it's better with the laptop.

443
00:19:21,246 --> 00:19:22,914
Fuck off.

444
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:24,457
You're not paying
enough attention to me.

445
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,669
I pay attention to you
all day at the office.

446
00:19:29,504 --> 00:19:30,922
Hey, you know, I don't think

447
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:32,716
I've ever seen you
brush your teeth before.

448
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:34,384
- Sure you have.
- No, I don't think so.

449
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:36,553
I know that you do brush,
but I don't think

450
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:38,013
I've ever actually witnessed it before.

451
00:19:38,014 --> 00:19:40,015
Well, here it is in all its glory.

452
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:41,808
Is that my toothbrush?

453
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:42,934
I don't know. Is it?

454
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:44,143
Yes, it is.

455
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:45,979
- You left it here.
- Peter, gross.

456
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,271
Oh, come on.

457
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:49,315
We've exchanged plenty of fluids.

458
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,360
Ohh. Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

459
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:53,653
No. Toothpaste.

460
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:56,155
It's not toothpaste.
I'm ravished.

461
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:57,448
No.

462
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:58,700
Mm.

463
00:20:00,912 --> 00:20:03,329
Go get it.

464
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,165
- I have to take this.
- Ohh.

465
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,501
This is Russo.

466
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:18,344
Yeah.
Right now it's 12:53.

467
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,519
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

468
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:31,858
I have to go.

469
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:33,443
Is everything okay?

470
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:34,903
It's work stuff.

471
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,487
What kind of work stuff?

472
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:38,531
Congressman Wallinski.
He wants to go over

473
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:41,242
the tax incentive stuff we sent him.

474
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:42,702
Peter,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

475
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,663
Hey, Peter.

476
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,090
I have meetings tomorrow.
I have a committee hearing.

477
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:57,550
Congress will survive without you.

478
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:00,386
Address, directions.

479
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:03,056
There's an e-ticket
in your name.

480
00:21:07,018 --> 00:21:08,937
Your flight leaves
at 6:30.

481
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:11,481
- You should head to the airport.
- This is coming from Frank?

482
00:21:11,482 --> 00:21:13,691
No. This is coming
from no one.

483
00:21:13,692 --> 00:21:15,819
You have the flu,
and you're calling in sick.

484
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,363
- What's that?
- What's what?

485
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:22,033
Is that a hickey?

486
00:21:22,034 --> 00:21:23,827
Are you whoring around again?

487
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:26,245
- No. I have a girlfriend.
- Mm.

488
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:29,082
You mean your little office romance.

489
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:30,959
What do you know about that?

490
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,753
When it comes to your life,
Peter, and what I know about it,

491
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:37,423
you should assume that there's
no such thing as a secret.

492
00:21:37,424 --> 00:21:39,300
Stay in touch.

493
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:42,137
You call me on my cell,
never at the office.

494
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:45,348
Good luck.

495
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,519
Knock 'em dead, tiger.

496
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,705
How are we?

497
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:12,042
Overtired, under-caffeinated,
but we're making progress.

498
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:14,961
- Less than a week to go.
- Yeah. We'll do our best.

499
00:22:14,962 --> 00:22:17,338
- You'll what?
- We'll get it done.

500
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,050
Somebody open a window.
It's rancid in here.

501
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:22,135
That is what happens when six people

502
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,554
don't shower for half a week.

503
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:26,305
Anything you need other than deodorant?

504
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:28,058
Yeah, this performance standards thing.

505
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:30,476
- The teachers unions are gonna--
- Leave it in.

506
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:32,937
- But we could delete it.
- I'll handle the unions. What else? Anything?

507
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:35,065
Conjugal visits?

508
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,566
I'll get back to work.

509
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:40,486
Nancy.

510
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,655
- Coming.
- What do I have next?

511
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:45,158
Constituent calls
from 2:10 to 2:35,

512
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,994
- fundraising until 3:50, deputy caucus at 4:00.
- The call list?

513
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:50,038
- It's on your desk.
- My briefing for the caucus?

514
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,165
- Next to the call list.
- Have you been in the conference room?

515
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,167
Have it steam cleaned over the weekend.

516
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:56,293
In the meantime, get those poor
kids some Febreze or something.

517
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:57,336
It's like a petting zoo.

518
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,799
You gotta see this.

519
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,802
But were they in line
with your thinking at the time?

520
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:08,139
We do not consider the issue of Israel

521
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,265
and Palestine a laughing matter.

522
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,227
And he calls Israel illegal.

523
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:14,854
Well, he's an anti-semite,
and he is wrong.

524
00:23:14,855 --> 00:23:17,232
We would have grave, grave concerns

525
00:23:17,233 --> 00:23:20,235
about appointing such a man
our next Secretary of State.

526
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:24,906
It's too easy.

527
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,307
Roy, hi.

528
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:34,892
My name is Peter Russo.
Congressman Russo.

529
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:38,271
I'd like to just
speak to you for just a...

530
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,730
Sir?

531
00:24:39,731 --> 00:24:42,566
Either you're lying,
and you can fuck off;

532
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:46,154
or you're telling the truth,
and you can absolutely fuck off.

533
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:48,739
I saw your web site.

534
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,867
I'm a fan.

535
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,912
And I brought you something.

536
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:08,676
Hey, babe, put some clothes on.

537
00:25:08,677 --> 00:25:10,678
- What?
- We got a guest.

538
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,305
So? Hey.

539
00:25:12,306 --> 00:25:14,098
Put some clothes on.

540
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:18,435
Ice or no ice?

541
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:20,313
- Uh, no ice.
- Good.

542
00:25:20,314 --> 00:25:22,857
We don't have any.

543
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:31,157
Fuck. Echo, I told you
to put the--

544
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,910
It's okay. It's okay.

545
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,829
I'll keep your secret if you keep mine.

546
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,665
A congressman, you say?

547
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:42,085
Right now,
I'm just a drinking companion.

548
00:25:42,086 --> 00:25:43,711
Well, all right, companion.

549
00:25:43,712 --> 00:25:45,420
Have yourself a drink.

550
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,395
Come on in.

551
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,996
$10,000.

552
00:26:18,997 --> 00:26:21,665
What will that get me?

553
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:25,336
I mean, I'm kinky, but I don't know
if I'm the girl you're looking for.

554
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:29,257
You're definitely the girl
that I'm looking for.

555
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,719
Excuse me.

556
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,180
All I want for that money
is your silence.

557
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,057
My what?

558
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:39,850
The guy you were with the other night,

559
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:42,395
the one who was arrested,
do you know who he was?

560
00:26:43,313 --> 00:26:44,855
You mean the congressman?

561
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,233
There was no congressman.
There was no arrest.

562
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:48,943
None of that exists.

563
00:26:48,944 --> 00:26:50,778
All that exists

564
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,072
is the money sitting right there
in front of you.

565
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:55,325
Do you understand?

566
00:26:56,993 --> 00:26:58,493
Yeah.

567
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,122
Good.

568
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,670
Open your mouth.

569
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,064
Last little bit's for me.

570
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,246
You're scolding me.

571
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,623
Am I?

572
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:47,542
You are, silently.

573
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,631
- Is it the rowing machine?
- You tell me.

574
00:27:52,632 --> 00:27:54,342
It's the rowing machine.

575
00:27:54,343 --> 00:27:57,303
- You haven't used it.
- How do you know I haven't?

576
00:27:57,304 --> 00:27:58,595
Francis.

577
00:27:58,596 --> 00:28:00,681
You know I don't like to be managed.

578
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:02,808
I'm not trying to manage you.

579
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,062
I just don't want
to outlive you by 25 years.

580
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:08,398
I must walk three miles a day
around that Capitol.

581
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,066
I'm constantly on my feet.

582
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:13,069
And do you know how many
calories the brain burns?

583
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,112
I'm not worried about your brain.

584
00:28:15,113 --> 00:28:18,573
It's your heart we're talking about.

585
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:23,287
Use the machine.

586
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,418
She's right.

587
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:30,503
I should take better care of myself.

588
00:28:30,504 --> 00:28:32,088
But it's the principle.

589
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:34,507
I won't be a slave
to anybody or anything

590
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:37,718
you can order
with a toll-free number.

591
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:51,607
We share the wealth in this republic.

592
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:02,034
I thought the whole
editorial team pitched in.

593
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:04,745
Sometimes.
Not that time, though.

594
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,747
But he must have written some of it?

595
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:10,751
No. That was all me.

596
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:14,838
What if people thought he wrote it?

597
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,966
Oh, fuck that.
He's a fraud.

598
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:20,428
Nah, he's worse than a fraud.
He's a fucking farce.

599
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:22,012
I'll tell you something.

600
00:29:22,013 --> 00:29:25,015
He used to be even more
of a maniac than I am.

601
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:27,684
- Chemicals?
- No. Politics.

602
00:29:27,685 --> 00:29:30,187
Oh, we had some nights, man.
Long conversations,

603
00:29:30,188 --> 00:29:32,398
dangerous fucking notions.

604
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,691
- Like what?
- You name it-- OPEC,

605
00:29:34,692 --> 00:29:37,278
Pinochet, the fucking Food Stamp Act.

606
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,364
Then the motherland
sang her mating call.

607
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:42,866
♪ O say can you-- ♪

608
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,328
Next thing, he's cramming
for the bar at Bryn Mawr

609
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:46,829
and snapping on a flag pin.

610
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,872
Does Bryn Mawr have a law school?

611
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:52,209
My point is, he started goose-stepping
in the marionette parade.

612
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,753
Left, right; red, blue;
Democrat, Republican.

613
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:57,340
We're all dangling
from the same strings.

614
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,843
Take a sledgehammer to the whole
fucking Punch and Judy show.

615
00:30:00,844 --> 00:30:03,720
- That's what's required.
- Thought you were a patriot.

616
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,681
Fuck, yeah.
One of the few.

617
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:08,476
- So what's wrong with public service?
- Public service?

618
00:30:08,477 --> 00:30:11,646
Come on. You gotta get a grip
on who your masters are.

619
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:16,108
The I.M.F., the World Bank,
the Rockefeller Trilateral Commission.

620
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:19,028
You bankroll their fucking death squads.

621
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:22,573
It's called FEMA;
it's called alcohol, tobacco, and firearms;

622
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:24,492
NATO; Border Control.

623
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:26,327
You think Katrina was incompetence?

624
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:28,412
That was highly orchestrated negligence.

625
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:32,041
Look at Waco, Amnesty
International, the A.C.L.U.

626
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:35,461
Smokescreens-- all of them.
Blood on their hands.

627
00:30:35,462 --> 00:30:37,254
Well, exactly.

628
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,799
You want me to lie to the people.

629
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,719
I want you to spare the people
another hypocrite.

630
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,347
What's in it for you?

631
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:48,891
Poetic justice.

632
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,394
Oh, come on.
You're one of them.

633
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:55,606
Can a corporate sellout
roll a joint like this?

634
00:30:55,607 --> 00:31:02,279
♪ Lord knows, I can't change ♪

635
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,199
If I wanted to do this thing,

636
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,910
how might I go about that, precisely?

637
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,047
How did it go?

638
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:22,717
There were a few tears here and there

639
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:25,010
and some anger,

640
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:27,680
but nothing unexpected.

641
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:34,437
I'm going to need you to
leave us today, too, Evelyn.

642
00:31:34,438 --> 00:31:36,355
I'm sorry.

643
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:39,066
I just can't have any doubt
about the direction I'm taking.

644
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,658
You just had me fire 18 people.

645
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:49,577
I know.

646
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:51,662
I sat across from them in this room,

647
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:54,206
and I had to tell
each and every one of--

648
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:55,874
I know.

649
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,211
I am 59 years old.

650
00:31:59,212 --> 00:32:01,255
Nobody hires anybody my age.

651
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:03,466
I will write you
any kind of recommenda--

652
00:32:03,467 --> 00:32:05,842
To do what, bag groceries?

653
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:08,011
What am I supposed to tell my daughter?

654
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,306
I'm sorry, Evelyn.
I truly am.

655
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:12,349
No, you're not.
You don't give a fuck.

656
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:17,020
Eighteen people, Claire.

657
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:23,444
Nineteen, if you count me.

658
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:27,573
I have to...

659
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:31,243
I have to call my daughter.

660
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:15,912
I know today has been tough.

661
00:33:15,913 --> 00:33:18,374
A lot of your colleagues have left,

662
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,126
and I owe you an explanation.

663
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:24,921
Many of those who left us today

664
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,090
helped build the C.W.I.
from the ground up,

665
00:33:27,091 --> 00:33:29,301
and I'm grateful to them.

666
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:32,429
But it is time for us to evolve,

667
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,930
and to accomplish this,

668
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,309
we had to make hard choices

669
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,729
and bring in new people.

670
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,314
That's what today was about.

671
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,776
You have any questions,

672
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:48,529
my door is always open.

673
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,658
I'm all good for national and metro.

674
00:33:52,659 --> 00:33:55,369
We've got space for political
if we need it.

675
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,913
Janine, anything new on Michael Kern?

676
00:33:57,914 --> 00:33:59,456
The White House is dodging.

677
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:02,209
You can't get anyone on record?

678
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,753
Not just me.

679
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:05,796
They're shutting all of us down
in the briefings.

680
00:34:05,797 --> 00:34:08,632
No one is giving an inch,
even on background.

681
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,426
In the meantime,
I'm working on a feature

682
00:34:10,427 --> 00:34:12,344
about the administration's
foreign policy agenda.

683
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:14,388
How it shifted
from the start of the campaign,

684
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,348
- increased D.O.D. spending, and--
- Received, Zoe.

685
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:19,935
I can link Kern directly
to the Williams editorial.

686
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:22,271
- What?
- I've got a guy named Roy Kapeniak

687
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,565
who was on the editorial staff
when Kern was there.

688
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:26,358
Hey, Twitter twat,
W.T.F.?

689
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:28,569
- Wait, wait, wait. Roy what?
- Kapeniak.

690
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,153
A classmate of Kern's.

691
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,615
I have him on record saying
Kern wrote every word

692
00:34:32,616 --> 00:34:35,033
- of the editorial.
- Let's move this into my office.

693
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:36,410
Zoe, Lucas.

694
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,501
Janine.

695
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,757
Let me-- let me,
once and for all,

696
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:51,133
say this definitively:

697
00:34:51,134 --> 00:34:53,469
I didn't author that editorial.

698
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:56,722
Not a single sentence,
word, comma, or period.

699
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:59,642
If memory serves me, it was
Mr. Kapeniak who wrote it.

700
00:34:59,643 --> 00:35:03,103
Why on earth he's trying to
claim that I did is beyond me.

701
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:06,732
Let me further say that I'm a strong
supporter of the state of Israel.

702
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:08,901
As the most stable country in the region

703
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:12,822
- and our strongest ally...
- It's Frank Underwood for Cathy.

704
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:14,406
...in any peace process,

705
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,909
because without the stability of Israel,

706
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,744
there can be no Palestine.

707
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:21,497
CNN right now.

708
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,418
"Without Israel
there can be no Palestine"?

709
00:35:26,419 --> 00:35:29,045
- I've got it on.
- I would remind Senator Kern

710
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:32,257
that there was a Palestine long
before there was an Israel.

711
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:35,511
His comments are not only
ignorant, they are racist.

712
00:35:35,512 --> 00:35:38,889
Get ready, Cathy. Things are
about to move very quickly.

713
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,933
- ...his understanding of the Middle East--
- Okay.

714
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:43,059
- ...is so out of sync with reality...
- I'm ready.

715
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,312
Hey.

716
00:35:45,313 --> 00:35:47,439
- Peter? No. Stop.
- Uh, not now.

717
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,900
Hey. Hey,
where have you been?

718
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:53,696
Oh, God, you're fucking high.

719
00:35:53,697 --> 00:35:55,739
- No. I--
- Yes, you are. Look at your eyes.

720
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,241
Oh, please, just lay off.

721
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:02,204
You promised me
it wouldn't be like this.

722
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,624
Cancel whatever I have
for the rest of the day.

723
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:44,496
Kern is out.

724
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,456
They're tossing him?

725
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:49,376
Technically, that would
draw himself, but yes.

726
00:36:49,377 --> 00:36:51,545
Can I say "A source
close to the White House"?

727
00:36:51,546 --> 00:36:54,089
No. You let this story
play out on its own time.

728
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,799
They'll announce in the morning.

729
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,844
I'm sorry. If not that,
what story are we talking about?

730
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:00,763
Catherine Durant.

731
00:37:00,764 --> 00:37:04,433
As soon as Kern withdraws, you
say she'll be the replacement.

732
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:07,477
- Is that true?
- It will be after you write it.

733
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:10,731
Roy Kapeniak was you.

734
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:14,443
You might very well think that.
I couldn't possibly comment.

735
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:16,361
You found him.
You had him call me.

736
00:37:16,362 --> 00:37:19,031
Kapeniak and Kern were
appetizers, Miss Barnes.

737
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,825
Catherine Durant is the meal.

738
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:26,789
Say that name:
Catherine Durant.

739
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,874
Say it over and over.

740
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:31,501
Tomorrow afternoon, write it down,

741
00:37:31,502 --> 00:37:34,296
and then watch that name
come out of the mouth

742
00:37:34,297 --> 00:37:37,716
of the President of the United States.

743
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:40,677
This is where we get to create.

744
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,269
Don't miss your train, Miss Barnes.

745
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,647
It's the last one tonight.

746
00:37:53,523 --> 00:37:56,234
Zoe Barnes with the Washington
Herald now reporting,

747
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,736
quoting a source close to the president,

748
00:37:57,737 --> 00:37:59,613
as saying that Senator Catherine Durant

749
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:02,240
will likely be the new nominee
for Secretary of State

750
00:38:02,241 --> 00:38:05,119
after Michael Kern's withdrawal
earlier this week.

751
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,412
The White House has remained
silent on whether the president

752
00:38:07,413 --> 00:38:09,039
will tap Durant for a nomination,

753
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,707
but a national Zogby Poll

754
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:13,293
shows wide support for Durant
across party lines.

755
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:16,005
Catherine Durant has served ten years on
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

756
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:18,757
made numerous diplomatic
missions to South America...

757
00:38:18,758 --> 00:38:21,677
We can place our faith in her,
knowing that we have a responsible,

758
00:38:21,678 --> 00:38:24,721
experienced, brilliant woman
representing our interests abroad.

759
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:28,183
Middle of the road, team
player, strong in defense.

760
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:30,769
If there's a woman that can work with
the joint chiefs, she's the one.

761
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,022
Durant is the way to go.
It's a no-brainer.

762
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:35,607
The president should stop this
pageant and simply make the call.

763
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:38,360
Why are we still talking about, if
they're going to nominate Durant?

764
00:38:38,361 --> 00:38:39,987
Why don't they just do it already

765
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:42,156
so we can all stop talking about ifs

766
00:38:42,157 --> 00:38:44,033
and start talking about when and what

767
00:38:44,034 --> 00:38:47,911
and how Durant's going to
shape up foreign policy...

768
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:16,314
So, history?

769
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,735
History.

770
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,533
I'm very impressed, Frank.

771
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,284
Good. With your go-ahead,
I'll start the mock-up.

772
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,079
Have Birch and Rasmussen seen this?

773
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,164
Not yet. I wanted you to be
the first to have a look.

774
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:34,208
I'll schedule a time for you
to fill in the president.

775
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:37,293
Oh, no, no, no. That is your turf, Linda.
You should do that.

776
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:40,547
- Thank you, Frank.
- My pleasure. Thank you.

777
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:43,926
- I so apologize for everything--
- No, no, no, n--

778
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:46,428
it's not necessary.

779
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:48,513
Now for the real meeting.

780
00:39:48,514 --> 00:39:51,892
So what is happening with Michael Kern?

781
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:53,977
Oh, it's a total nightmare.

782
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:56,312
You know who you're gonna tap next?

783
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,648
Frank, we still need you
in the house--

784
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:00,734
No, no, no.
I wouldn't dream of it.

785
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:03,237
We've got our education bill.
I was just curious.

786
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:05,155
Somehow the rumor is flying around

787
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:06,990
that we're gonna nominate
Catherine Durant.

788
00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:09,743
- I'm sure you've noticed.
- Is the rumor true?

789
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:11,453
Well, we weren't
considering her at first,

790
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:13,163
but the president asked me
to have her vetted

791
00:40:13,164 --> 00:40:15,582
in case we wanna go that route.

792
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:18,376
- Interesting.
- What do you think?

793
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,590
Well, she wouldn't be
my first choice--

794
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,217
Who would be your first choice?

795
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:27,510
She campaigned hard against us
in the primaries.

796
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:31,181
- That's my reservation.
- But you'd show yourself above party politics,

797
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,391
and I know she'd work
all the harder for it.

798
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:36,019
Decent experience,
respect across the aisle.

799
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,147
So you think we can
seriously consider her?

800
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,734
It's not the worst idea in the world.

801
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:05,381
- Where are you getting this shit?
- What?

802
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:08,844
- Your stories. Who are you fucking?
- I was just--

803
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,763
- Nobody.
- Oh, come on.

804
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:15,017
You're a metro scrub,
and now look at you.

805
00:41:15,018 --> 00:41:16,935
You'd have to be fucking
somebody important.

806
00:41:16,936 --> 00:41:19,896
I'm just doing my job, Janine.

807
00:41:19,897 --> 00:41:21,815
Excuse me.

808
00:41:27,362 --> 00:41:29,823
All set.

809
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:34,328
- Is this your first remote?
- Yeah, it's my first time.

810
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:47,216
Right into the camera,
don't shift in your seat,

811
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:49,843
and there's no reason to speak
above a conversational volume.

812
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:52,095
- The mic will pick you up. You all ready?
- Yeah.

813
00:41:52,096 --> 00:41:54,348
All right.
Don't forget to breathe.

814
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:00,478
Five, four...

815
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:08,570
We'd like to welcome Zoe
Barnes from the Washington Herald.

816
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:10,697
Zoe, thank you for joining us.

817
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:13,408
I'm very glad to be here.
Thank you for having me.

818
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:16,912
You broke the education bill, the
Kern editorial, and now Durant.

819
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:19,539
I'm just thrilled to be
reporting news that matters.

820
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,457
And it's truly been a team effort.

821
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:23,459
Everyone at the Herald pitched in.

822
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:27,547
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

823
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,841
First national story, first...

824
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,769
Thank you.

825
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,522
Calling it a night.

826
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:48,277
See you tomorrow, sir.

827
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,743
But, yes, a lot of firsts.

828
00:42:56,744 --> 00:42:59,371
First national story,

829
00:42:59,372 --> 00:43:01,539
first front-page byline,

830
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,167
first TV interview.

831
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:09,005
I would wave to my mom, but the
cameraman said not to shift in my seat.

832
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:15,011
What a roller coaster.

833
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,932
It really is too bad.
Kern was a good man.

834
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,226
- And now Catherine Durant.
- Yes.

835
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:23,603
Right place, right time, I suppose.

836
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,522
- We like her, don't we?
- Very much.

837
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,692
Question is, does she like San
Corp as much as we like her?

838
00:43:29,693 --> 00:43:32,279
I would say that
that is a very good bet.

839
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,239
But then again, I'm not a betting man.

840
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,908
- No. You always like a sure thing.
- When it avails itself.

841
00:43:36,909 --> 00:43:38,952
- Good night, Remy.
- Good night, Frank.

842
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:42,414
- See you around.
- Hopefully less and less now.

843
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,963
Oh, no.
I charged the wrong thing.

844
00:43:49,964 --> 00:43:52,799
- What did you have again?
- A medium decaf latte.

845
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,345
Med lat, dec.

846
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:03,101
I don't know how to get it to go back.

847
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:05,728
- This one and this one.
- This one?

848
00:44:05,729 --> 00:44:07,897
No. Let me do it.

849
00:44:21,037 --> 00:44:23,163
I have to ask you
to stay back, congressman.

850
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:25,790
- What's going on?
- Some guy was trying to get into the building.

851
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:29,002
When we said no, he started
tearing his clothes off.

852
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:54,819
Nobody can hear you.
Nobody cares about you.

853
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,905
Nothing will come of this.

854
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:03,786
Why don't you let these nice
gentlemen take you home?

855
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:13,963
Cover him up.
It's cold out here.

856
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:16,174
You heard the congressman.

857
00:45:16,175 --> 00:45:18,260
Cover him up.

858
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:42,284
Francis?

859
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:42,029
