1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,800
The whole reason we do
these meetings, Frank,

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,997
is so I can get accurate
information from you.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,992
I always said it
was going to be close.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,878
Then why did every
article I read yesterday

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
say the leadership was
confident the bill would pass?

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,954
Do you know Janine Skorsky?

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,952
<i>She used to be The Herald's
White House correspondent.</i>

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,360
I remember Janine.

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,113
<i>She wrote
an article for Slugline</i>

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,953
reporting
a verified vote count.

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,120
Once the media got ahold of
that, it went everywhere.

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,356
I don't know where she got that number.
Maybe she made it up.

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,920
It doesn't matter
if she made it up.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,469
The Democrats seem divided. The
leadership looks incompetent.

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,234
But compared to the budget
and our Education Act,

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,720
why, this was
a minor bill, sir.

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,871
That happened to be in
the national spotlight,

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,189
which is what you wanted.

19
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,919
I got the count wrong.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,880
It rarely happens,
but it happens.

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,792
See, what worries me is that
the White House's influence

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,633
isn't translating into
support on the Hill.

23
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,837
Linda's involvement
had no effect?

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,758
I wouldn't say that
that's the case, sir.

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,400
Did you sense any pushback, any
fallout from the education battle?

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,797
Sir, the truth is
I wasn't there.

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,518
I had to make a trip
to California to meet

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,552
the Provost of Stanford,
for my son.

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,869
I told you about it last week.

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,634
It was my decision, sir.
I made a judgment call

31
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,480
that we could pass the
bill without her help.

32
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,716
But, look,
tight votes like this,

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,154
you can analyze them to death,

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,879
but at the end of the
day, we came up short.

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,556
That's my fault, no one else's.
Certainly not Linda's.

36
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,155
I shouldn't have gone. The
meeting didn't even work.

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,072
I thought you said they
were reconsidering.

38
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,719
No. I got an email
this morning.

39
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,235
They decided not to overturn
the admissions decision.

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,640
Oh, Christ. I'm sorry, Linda.

41
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,989
Yeah. Not a great day so far.

42
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,640
But I appreciate your
covering for me in there.

43
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,433
There may be a way to turn Linda's
bad luck into my good fortune.

44
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,638
But first, I must deal with
treason within the ranks,

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,235
the two renegades who
voted against the bill.

46
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,118
I have zero
tolerance for betrayal,

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,192
which they will
soon indelibly learn.

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,319
I know why you lost the vote.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,720
Somebody got to
Vanderburgh and Abrams.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,790
Remy Danton.

51
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,110
Your wife.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,960
I've got contacts
on both their staffs.

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,997
There was a meeting between
the three of them.

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,679
I know. I arranged it.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
She told them to vote no.

56
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,120
No, not true.

57
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,160
Sources on two different staffs
saying the exact same thing?

58
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,510
That makes no sense.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,150
I'm not telling you what makes
sense, I'm telling you facts.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,515
This is a juicy story, Francis.

61
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,994
Carly will love it.

62
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,915
The Majority Whip's wife
stabs him in the back.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,956
Be careful, Zoe.

64
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,317
I'm feeding you.
Now you have to feed me.

65
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,870
So give me something better.

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,356
Are you going to
answer my question?

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,231
Did she or didn't she?

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,913
Tell me now, or so help me God,

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,673
I will make it
my mission in life

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,559
to not only
destroy your careers,

71
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,554
but to obliterate all hope and
happiness that you manage to cling to.

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,561
She said it would be okay...

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,590
To backstab me?

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,353
To do what we
thought was right.

75
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,477
So she did tell you to vote no.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,871
She said it wouldn't be the end
of the world if the bill failed.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,440
Those were her exact words.

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,590
You discuss this with no one.
Is that understood?

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,675
Do you blame
yourself for not being

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,995
in Washington to
secure the votes?

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,390
A bill this size is a team effort.
There were a lot of sponsors.

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,119
But you were the chief sponsor
and the bill manager.

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,594
That's true.

84
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,955
So shouldn't you
have been in Washington?

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,076
I'm running for governor.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,961
I have a commitment to
the people of my state.

87
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,601
Are you aware that
the Swofford campaign

88
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,592
is putting out a new
commercial today that says,

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,911
quote, if Peter Russo can't
follow through in Congress,

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,514
can he follow
through with sobriety?

91
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,875
That's all.
Thank you very much.

92
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,474
Do you want to comment?
Thanks, guys.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,199
Congressman!

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,949
All I said was what you always
say, to vote their conscience.

95
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,077
You encouraged them to defy me.

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,674
I met with them. That's
what you asked me...

97
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,353
No, that is not what you did.

98
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,831
I specifically told you I needed
them to vote yes on this bill.

99
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,559
There was no room
for interpretation.

100
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,155
It's a deliberate lie, so don't
try to sugarcoat it, Claire.

101
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,880
I needed Remy's help.
You wouldn't offer any.

102
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,355
Oh, wait.

103
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,874
You did this for Remy?

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,634
No. For myself. To get my
shipment out of Sudan.

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
He provided assistance.

106
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,271
In exchange for
defeating the bill.

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,955
No. In exchange for not
helping it succeed.

108
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,997
Which is the same
goddamn thing.

109
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,070
Do you realize
you have endangered

110
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,992
everything that we have
been working toward?

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,992
There was
a timetable here, Claire.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,800
We needed strong momentum right
up until the last minute.

113
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,236
I can't operate based on plans
you haven't shared with me.

114
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,634
Then you should've
asked me first.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,554
No, I'm not going to
ask for your blessing

116
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,160
on every decision
I make, Francis.

117
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
We make decisions together.

118
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
Yeah, well, it hasn't felt like that.
Not for the past six months.

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,794
I don't feel as though
I'm standing beside you.

120
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,160
Other people know, Claire.

121
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,358
This could become
a story about us.

122
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,200
And that's something you
do not recover from.

123
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,919
Who? That's something that
follows you for life.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,354
Who knows?

125
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,390
Zoe.

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,193
I thought you said
she could be trusted.

127
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,754
What about our trust?

128
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,280
You can't control her,
can you, Francis?

129
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,953
She wouldn't have been a
problem if you hadn't lied.

130
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,156
No, she wouldn't
have been a problem

131
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,396
if you hadn't
dropped your pants.

132
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,957
And you come in here, to
my office, and berate me

133
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,838
when you're the one
who's exposed us?

134
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,560
Don't you try to
turn this around on me.

135
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
I fired half of
my staff for us.

136
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,433
I have turned down
donations for us.

137
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,000
I drafted Peter's bill for us.

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,312
I diverted time and energy
away from my goals for us.

139
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,076
Okay, I don't wanna have to say this,
but maybe you need to hear it.

140
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,513
CWI is important, yes,

141
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,839
but it doesn't come close to what
we are trying to accomplish.

142
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,434
You must see that!

143
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,192
I'm just being honest.

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,119
Then be honest about how
you've been using me

145
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,793
just like you
use everybody else.

146
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,633
That was never
part of the bargain.

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,995
Is it the hot flashes?

148
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,069
Get out.

149
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,715
Get out.

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,999
I'll see you back at the house.

151
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,910
I'm on my way to the office.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,990
Let me call you
when I get there.

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,110
No, no. We need to talk now.

154
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,510
<i>I know you're upset, Peter, but
that's not going to achieve anything.</i>

155
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,195
I am more than upset, Frank.

156
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,795
Change your tone.
I'm in no mood.

157
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,836
<i>I don't give a fuck!</i>

158
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,910
Goodbye, Peter.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,789
You hang up on me now, you're not
gonna appreciate who I call next.

160
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,155
Excuse me?

161
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,600
<i>I promised my people jobs.</i>

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,316
You promised me you could
get this bill passed.

163
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,199
You failed on your promise.
I'm not gonna fail on mine.

164
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,239
So however you need to fix
it, you figure it out.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,032
Otherwise, I go public with
Kapeniak and the Kern editorial.

166
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,555
You need to cool down and think very
carefully about what you just said.

167
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,553
You don't understand. I'm not
afraid of you anymore, Frank.

168
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,790
Then you're misguided.

169
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,036
<i>My past is out in the open.</i>

170
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,313
You don't hold that
over my head anymore.

171
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
They don't know
everything, Peter.

172
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,429
You destroy me,
you destroy yourself.

173
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,235
<i>Fix it.</i>

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,030
What do you want me to do?

175
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,280
We have to accelerate things.

176
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,472
Isn't it too early? It's almost two
full months into the election.

177
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,279
That gives the White House too
much time to vet somebody.

178
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,476
Peter's crossed the line.

179
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,359
We built up his confidence, and
now we're losing control of him.

180
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,590
Maybe he was just
blowing off steam.

181
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,871
No. He's determined.
We have to act now.

182
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,561
You have everything
you need in your end?

183
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,194
Give me a when and a where.

184
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,078
Some sort of social
setting is preferable.

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,038
Anything else? I'll need cash.

186
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,520
About 3 grand.

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
It'll be in your top drawer
by tomorrow morning.

188
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,510
Sir.

189
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,510
Once we do this,
we're committed.

190
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,590
Understood.

191
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,719
I can't predict
how he's gonna react.

192
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,479
Well, I won't be blackmailed.

193
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,030
Hello?

194
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,080
Zoe Barnes?

195
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,473
Yeah. Who is it?

196
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,919
Claire Underwood.

197
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,516
Zoe?

198
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,679
I apologize for not buzzing.

199
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,001
Somebody was coming in the
building when I was downstairs,

200
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,560
so I just figured...

201
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,194
This is nice. Fire escape.

202
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,793
Hey, could you please not
go through my things?

203
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,360
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I intruding?

204
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,875
Yeah, actually. You are.

205
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,152
Well, that makes it a
two-way street, I suppose.

206
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,470
Okay, if you... If you
came here to punish me.

207
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,074
Fine. I get it.

208
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,240
Such a shame.

209
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,114
How naive you are.

210
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,674
I'm not naive.

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,989
No?

212
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,236
I've known everything
from the beginning, Zoe.

213
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,630
My husband and I tell
each other everything.

214
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,118
Don't you believe me?

215
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,639
Is there a spider I can trap?

216
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,595
I'm not here to punish you
or to tell you to stop.

217
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,151
I just thought I should
open those big bright eyes.

218
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,152
I think you should leave.

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,439
I think I should, too.

220
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,469
Maybe you're not that naive.

221
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,274
A lesser woman wouldn't
have opened the door.

222
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,518
Union Station, please.

223
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,715
<i>This is Claire. I'm unavailable
to answer the phone,</i>

224
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,075
<i>but if you leave a
message, I'll be sure</i>

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,640
<i>and get back to you shortly.
Thank...</i>

226
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,475
<i>Hello? Zoe.</i>

227
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,551
You don't have to tiptoe.

228
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,478
I thought you fell asleep.

229
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,956
No. Just thinking about work.

230
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,760
I don't have anything for you yet.
I will soon.

231
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,314
I know you will.

232
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,956
You can spend
the night if you want.

233
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,360
Early meetings.

234
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,194
Wouldn't have time to
get home and change.

235
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,600
You seem distracted.

236
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,074
I have a lot on my mind.

237
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,833
Like what?

238
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,956
Work, just like you.

239
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,156
No Claire?

240
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,954
Or maybe she qualifies as work.

241
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,749
She didn't mention anything?

242
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,516
About...

243
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,436
I thought you didn't keep
things from each other.

244
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,391
Look, just say
what you want to say.

245
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,831
She came by here
a few hours ago.

246
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,477
We had a nice little talk.

247
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
Don't let me keep you.

248
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,998
You should go home,
get some rest.

249
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,754
Tell Claire I said hi.

250
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,310
Claire!

251
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,080
<i>This is Claire. I'm
unavailable to answer...</i>

252
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,513
The lights in the Wartons' house
will go on in a few moments.

253
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,398
They always get up
precisely at 6:45,

254
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,073
which is just the time that Claire
would be going for her run,

255
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,117
if she were here.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,639
Rebellion on all fronts.

257
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,439
Claire, Zoe, Russo.

258
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,831
I must not lose my resolve.

259
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,033
I will march forward,

260
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,271
even if I have to do so

261
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,510
alone.

262
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,878
See? Told ya.

263
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,755
Good morning.

264
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,439
Hi, Frank.

265
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,550
How are you?

266
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,670
I'm good.

267
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,955
Have you heard from Claire?

268
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,194
Yeah, I got her message.

269
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,600
How's she feeling?

270
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,995
A lot better.

271
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,390
Good. She said she'd be gone
for the rest of the week.

272
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,432
Is it the flu or something?
Something like that.

273
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
I just came over to pick up a
few things from her office.

274
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,710
Oh.

275
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,836
I could've sent somebody over.

276
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,950
No. It's no big deal.

277
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,272
In fact, I also came
here to ask you a favor.

278
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,192
You went to Stanford, correct?

279
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,873
Valedictorian? Yeah.

280
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,472
Do you know the Provost?

281
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,630
Warren Tynsdale.

282
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,280
He flies me out to
do fundraising events.

283
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,070
Supposedly I'm the
poster child for alumni.

284
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,879
Making the world
a better place.

285
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,077
Well, that is good, because
this is important.

286
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,757
Linda Vasquez, the
President's Chief of Staff,

287
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,354
her son, Ruben, applied.

288
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,796
I'd love for you to get on
the phone with Tynsdale

289
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,481
and tell him that
they should accept him.

290
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't know. I... I've
never recommended anyone.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,878
All the better.
It'll carry more weight.

292
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,592
Can I meet Ruben first?

293
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,359
I would really
prefer that Linda not know.

294
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,274
In fact, it would be better
if both she and Ruben

295
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,113
believed he got
in on merit alone.

296
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,195
Will you please do this
favor for Claire and me?

297
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,195
And for the President.

298
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,874
Thank you.

299
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,874
More contrast.

300
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,111
We need to catch
the edge of his face.

301
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,080
Let's re-crop it. Bring it in a
quarter of an inch on the left.

302
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,110
Would you?

303
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,990
Somebody named Claire?

304
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,116
Remy.

305
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,274
You hungry?

306
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,272
I don't eat pork.

307
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,999
When did that happen?

308
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,356
When we started lobbying for
the meatpacking industry.

309
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,720
Freddy, half a rack for me,

310
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,917
and some collard greens
for my friend here.

311
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,593
I'm good. I already ate lunch.

312
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,034
Half a rack coming up.

313
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,913
I don't usually do business here.
This is my little secret.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,601
I'd love it if we
could keep it that way.

315
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,956
I don't think you have to worry
about me bringing clients by.

316
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,760
You seem tense, Remy.

317
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,312
I assume you're upset
about the Watershed Bill.

318
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,357
Not with you. You were
just doing your job.

319
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,671
But now I have to do mine.

320
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,956
I'd like to propose
a partnership.

321
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,311
I'm always open to
partnerships, Frank.

322
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,319
If Peter Russo were a
pro-natural gas candidate,

323
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,390
how valuable would
that be to SanCorp?

324
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,359
The Watershed Bill
is anti-drilling.

325
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,909
Peter's pro-employment,
not anti-drilling.

326
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,880
He just wants to bring
employment to his people,

327
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,750
and SanCorp is
building refineries.

328
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,990
Mostly on site.

329
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,590
Do you think they would be open
to considering Philadelphia?

330
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,798
I can talk with them, but I
can't make any promises.

331
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,191
I don't want any promises.
Just engage with Russo.

332
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,040
You know, give him a
glimmer of good fortune.

333
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,955
Ah, Frank, here you go.

334
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,029
Come on. Smell that.

335
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,277
You sure you don't want to
reconsider your stance on pork?

336
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,840
Brain food, brother.

337
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,753
I love it. $850.

338
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,436
You can afford that?

339
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,955
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

340
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,350
First and last
month are taken care of.

341
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,114
So is the security deposit.

342
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,396
That's to buy some furniture.

343
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,553
I'll pay you back. I promise.

344
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,393
It's not necessary.

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,310
But I do need you to
do one thing for me.

346
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
I'd come across as a hypocrite.

347
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,396
You need jobs.

348
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,153
Do you really care
how you deliver them?

349
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,630
First, I advocate for more
regulation for the watershed,

350
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,518
then I cozy up to
the drilling interests?

351
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,399
Yeah, but natural gas
is the future, Peter.

352
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,314
This is an industry that
could bring 100,000 jobs

353
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,278
into your state
over the next decade.

354
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,273
I agree with Peter. It
seems like flip-flopping.

355
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,429
SanCorp's lobbying efforts is
why we lost the Watershed Bill.

356
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,309
But they can also be
a very powerful ally.

357
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,798
Our message is "A fresh start."

358
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,712
This makes you look like
"Business as usual."

359
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,836
This is politics.

360
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,478
There are seized opportunities
and missed opportunities.

361
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,152
Seize this one, Peter.

362
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,195
SanCorp can commit to building
new refineries in Philly?

363
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,000
SanCorp will commit to
discussing it with you.

364
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,150
I need more than that.

365
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,356
Look, you asked me
to fix a problem.

366
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,274
I've come to you in less than
24 hours with a solution.

367
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,635
Can you meet me halfway?

368
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,596
What would be the first step?

369
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,199
All right.
You remember
Remy Danton?

370
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,438
Oh, come on. He led the charge
against the Watershed Bill.

371
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,680
I know. That's not the point.

372
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,039
One of his other big clients is
the McNeally Cancer Institute.

373
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,753
They're having
a big gala tonight,

374
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,439
a cocktail party
for their donors.

375
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,795
Remy will be there.

376
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,360
We have events in
Haverford and Gladwyne.

377
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,954
Yeah, well,
this is more important.

378
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,633
You also have
a radio interview tomorrow

379
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,321
morning with a local
Pittsburgh station?

380
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,470
Yes. All right.

381
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,710
Meet with Remy tonight.

382
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,437
And if it goes well and
if you're comfortable,

383
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,831
tomorrow morning on the radio, you
support their drilling efforts.

384
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,312
And Remy has assured me
if you do that,

385
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,392
he can push SanCorp in
the right direction.

386
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,310
Cancel the events tomorrow.

387
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Head back to Philly, do
some damage control.

388
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,593
I'll see you
tomorrow afternoon.
Peter...

389
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,000
Please.

390
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,516
Okay.

391
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,396
I'm gonna go make some calls.

392
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,279
Peter, have you mentioned anything
to her about Kapeniak or...

393
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,912
No. I haven't
mentioned it
to anybody.

394
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,431
All right. Stamper will
come by in the morning

395
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,876
and brief you on
the talking points.

396
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,599
When did you take this?

397
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,037
Oh, it was about
7:00 in the morning.

398
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,959
The sun had just come up.

399
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,951
You were asleep right here.

400
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,994
The light was perfect.

401
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,993
I had no choice.

402
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,715
I always slept so well
in this apartment.

403
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,994
How long are you in town for?

404
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,400
I don't know.

405
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,193
I haven't decided.

406
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,720
You have no luggage.

407
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,954
It smells the same.

408
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,199
Feels the same.

409
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,279
I think SanCorp is missing out,

410
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,875
not having a significant
presence in Philadelphia.

411
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,714
There are advantages to centralizing
in a major urban center.

412
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,440
But the disadvantages are
commercial real estate prices,

413
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,233
city taxes, political pipeline.

414
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,640
It's all very costly.

415
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,040
So they'd have to
reduce costs elsewhere.

416
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,395
Significantly.

417
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,835
How can I help with that?

418
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,957
Statewide permitted use zoning.

419
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,315
No more conditional zoning.

420
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,471
The municipalities are
slowing down development.

421
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,880
That's the state legislature.

422
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,439
You come out in support of permitted
use, and you get elected governor.

423
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,796
That'll put pressure
on the legislature.

424
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,314
SanCorp is very
interested in having

425
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,874
a powerful friend
in Harrisburg.

426
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,555
My opponent's pro-drilling.

427
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,075
Your opponent isn't asking for
refineries in Philadelphia.

428
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,079
We prefer friends
we can count on.

429
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,397
Have your clients listen
to WZPZ tomorrow at 7:45.

430
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,672
It's a Pittsburgh station.

431
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,681
It's been a pleasure,
Congressman.

432
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,515
I look forward to
talking again soon.

433
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,080
You got a light?

434
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,191
This is a cancer
research event.

435
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,592
I know. I helped organize it.

436
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,801
You work for the institute?

437
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,830
No. The hotel.

438
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,634
And they let you smoke here?

439
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,710
No. The manager would kill me.

440
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,078
Well, at least
it got you talking.

441
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,916
Are you having a good night?
You look happy.

442
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,276
Ah, I am. I am.
I'm having a great night.

443
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,635
Why?

444
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,035
I just got some very good news.

445
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,359
We should celebrate.
What are you drinking?

446
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,033
You know,
I was just leaving, actually.

447
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,634
You haven't even
asked my name yet.

448
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,991
I apologize, but I have to go.

449
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,190
It's Rachel.

450
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,033
I'm not trying to be rude, but
I got a big meeting tomorrow.

451
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,396
Then don't be rude. Just
stay a few more minutes

452
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,756
and keep me from
having to mingle.

453
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,876
My date ditched me.

454
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,435
So if you abandon me now,
that would be very rude.

455
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,280
These heels are killing me.

456
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,149
Feel that. Feel that blister.

457
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,640
Hey, I...

458
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,830
I have a girlfriend.

459
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,433
I'd be surprised if you didn't.

460
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
Why'd your date ditch you?
Mmm...

461
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,840
Very scandalous.

462
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,196
Mmm-hmm? What happened?

463
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,158
Clink glasses with me.

464
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,676
Wow.

465
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,716
Oh!

466
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,639
I'm petite,
but I can hold my liquor.

467
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,040
Obviously.

468
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,632
When I do get drunk, though...

469
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,630
What then?

470
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,399
I get undressed.

471
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,950
What about you?

472
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,356
What are you like
when you get drunk?

473
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,675
It's not pretty.

474
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,075
Pretty's overrated.

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,716
I like it when things
get a little bit ugly.

476
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,640
When I work late nights, they
let me stay at the hotel

477
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,313
so I don't have to drive home.

478
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,516
This one is yours.

479
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,240
Room 1121.

480
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,679
Sir? In here.

481
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,474
You wanted to see me?

482
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,718
I need you to locate somebody.

483
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,870
Who?

484
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,669
My wife.

485
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,519
Do you have
a way of doing that?

486
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,800
I do, sir.

487
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,713
I know a guy, Missing Persons.

488
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,315
She's not missing. I just

489
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,790
don't know where
she is at the moment.

490
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,154
I trust him.

491
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,274
We can do this off the books.

492
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,510
Good.

493
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,677
I'll get on it right away.

494
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,681
Come on. Give us another one.

495
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,756
No. I'll tell you why.

496
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,833
Because my mother always used
to tell me to smile more.

497
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,320
Always drove me crazy.
She'd say,

498
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,756
"Claire, why have you
that scowl all the time?

499
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,038
"You look so much more
beautiful when you smile."

500
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,190
It was never
a real conversation.

501
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,358
There was never, "Oh, what do you
feel?" Or "What are you thinking?"

502
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,352
Just so long as I looked
beautiful and happy.

503
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,033
That's all she cared about.

504
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,598
So you want me to ask you what
you're thinking and feeling?

505
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,520
All the time.

506
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,357
I actually do wanna know what
you're thinking and feeling.

507
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,556
How sad am I?

508
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,676
Okay, so tell me first.

509
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,438
What? Tell me first.

510
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,070
I think I'd better get dressed.

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,316
What? Why?

512
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,397
Ah, because...

513
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,870
I've got friends coming over,

514
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,953
and as a host, I should
probably wear clothes.

515
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,110
Really? Yeah.

516
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,435
Why do you do that?

517
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,789
Well, you know.

518
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,115
It's proper?

519
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,390
Kind of.

520
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,075
Oh, fuck.

521
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,759
Thought you might have bailed.

522
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,675
Sit down.

523
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,439
Vodka or whiskey?

524
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,239
Ah, you go ahead.

525
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,711
Come on. You can be a good
boy downstairs, not up here.

526
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,439
Seriously, I'm good.

527
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,193
Whiskey, I think.

528
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,157
So what's your good news?

529
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,197
I wanna know what
we're celebrating.

530
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,559
Why did your... Why did
your date ditch you?

531
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,999
I asked you first.
I did, downstairs.

532
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,633
He works on the Hill.

533
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,632
Some staffer or something.

534
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,518
I don't know. I think
he's a glorified gofer.

535
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,320
A friend set me up with him.

536
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,869
So I said he should come
tonight, keep me company.

537
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,872
But all he wanted
to do was schmooze.

538
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,199
So I brought him into
the women's bathroom,

539
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,112
told him he was
being an asshole.

540
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,473
He told me I was being childish.
So I slapped him.

541
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,630
You slapped him?

542
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,394
Yeah. Big red hand mark
right across his face.

543
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,950
I think he was embarrassed to
be seen by the schmoozerati.

544
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,554
So he left.

545
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,916
And that is the last
time I go on a date

546
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,350
with a guy who wears
a flag pin to work.

547
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,797
I'm one of those guys who
wears a flag pin to work.

548
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,752
This isn't
really a date, is it?

549
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,351
I really shouldn't be here.

550
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,832
That's what makes it fun.

551
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,558
Tell me your good news. I wanna
know what we're toasting to.

552
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,353
Let's toast to you.

553
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,031
I'm your good news? Okay,
I'll toast to that.

554
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,036
Hey.

555
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,356
What are you...

556
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,833
<i>I didn't wanna
wait at The Herald.</i>

557
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,157
I was gonna call you, but...

558
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,596
Can I stay at
your place tonight?

559
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,356
Uh, stay with me?

560
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,632
Well, just on your couch
for a night or two.

561
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,116
Uh...

562
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,520
Why?

563
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,869
I can't be in my apartment.

564
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,517
Did something happen? No. I...

565
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,194
I'm sorry.

566
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,070
Zoe.

567
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,789
Come on.

568
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,073
What time is the interview?

569
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,038
7:45. I'll be with him.

570
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,240
And where's Peter now?

571
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,434
Are you sure you
want the details?

572
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,510
Mmm.

573
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,551
Just tell me, is it going well?

574
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,552
Hasn't been any updates.

575
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,040
But if it does go well,
you'll be ready?

576
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,874
I'm ready.
I've been ready. I'm ready.

577
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,030
Anything else?

578
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
We never played
chess before, have we?

579
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,030
I don't know how.

580
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,270
You want me to teach you?

581
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,399
I should really get some rest.
Be fresh for the morning.

582
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,109
Yeah, another time.

583
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,515
1160, WZPZ, 7:45. Good night.

584
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,391
I hate being kept in the dark.

585
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,680
Waiting.

586
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
Speculating.

587
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,400
Useless.

588
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,839
Oh, come on! Let's dance.

589
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,239
This is really nice.

590
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,358
Do you want anything?
Water? Juice?

591
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,238
No, thanks. I'm good.

592
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,595
Uh, you can have the bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.

593
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,716
No. No.

594
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
It's fine.

595
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,512
Please, Lucas, let me sleep on the couch.
I'll feel bad.

596
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,880
All right.

597
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,953
Could I help? I got it.

598
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,520
So...

599
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,717
You know, we don't have to
talk if you don't want to.

600
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,996
But I haven't
seen you in, like,

601
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,554
six months.

602
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,839
Except for when I drunkenly
stalked you at your...

603
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,396
Right.

604
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,630
That was kind of adorable.

605
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,918
It was either psychotic or sad.

606
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,156
Not adorable.

607
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,030
Yes, it was.

608
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,233
Can you hand me that pillow?

609
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,720
So, why do you need to get
out of your apartment?

610
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,874
It just felt small.

611
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,755
Well, it can't be
smaller than my place.

612
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,718
No. I don't mean size.
I mean...

613
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,714
I felt trapped.

614
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,075
Like I was in a place that
I didn't actually live.

615
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,319
Does that make any sense?

616
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,149
I guess.

617
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,590
Okay.

618
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,240
There you go.

619
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,870
Um...

620
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,680
Any time you need
to get up? Or...

621
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,434
Um, I'll just set
an alarm on my phone.

622
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,591
All right.
Well, feel free
to watch TV.

623
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,876
I can sleep through anything.

624
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,358
Hey, thank you, Lucas.

625
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,796
Hey, that's the last of it.

626
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,230
Better make it count, then.

627
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,400
Drink up.

628
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,196
Do I look familiar to you?

629
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,672
Familiar? No.

630
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,032
My face? My body? No.

631
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,469
How about my voice?

632
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,156
Have we...

633
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,796
No.

634
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,481
No. I was just
wondering if you had

635
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,000
a thing for brunettes
with blue eyes.

636
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,389
Hey, where you going?
Come back here.

637
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,840
I wanna see you better.

638
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,036
Shit. The sun's up?

639
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,036
Has been for a while.

640
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,793
Oh, fuck. What time is it?

641
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,870
7:15.

642
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,759
Fuck. I have an interview
in half an hour.

643
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,194
Skip it.
I can't. I gotta do it.

644
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,235
You can keep
the room till noon.

645
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,591
<i>Hello? I'm at your building.</i>

646
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,359
<i>The front desk keeps calling
up, but there's no answer.</i>

647
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,079
I'm not there.

648
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,833
<i>Then I'll come to you.
Where are you?</i>

649
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,311
I'm at the Park Highmore Hotel.

650
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,198
<i>Are you okay? You sound drunk.</i>

651
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,512
It was...
Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.

652
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,954
<i>You have the interview.</i>

653
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,514
I know!

654
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,080
<i>Have you been drinking, Peter?</i>

655
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,870
Uh, what? No. I just decided
to spend the night here.

656
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,235
<i>What room are you in?</i>

657
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,918
11... 1121.

658
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,233
<i>Stay there.
I'm coming right now.</i>

659
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,716
Jesus, Peter. What happened?
You're drunk.

660
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,036
I'm fine.

661
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,230
I can smell it on you.

662
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,597
Okay, I had a drink or two.
It was nothing crazy.

663
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,834
We can't do this interview.

664
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,758
I'm sober. I can handle it.

665
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,593
You're slurring your words.

666
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,955
I'm good.

667
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,320
I think we should cancel.

668
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,232
I'm gonna do the interview.

669
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,152
Just give me
the talking points.

670
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,040
Sorry.

671
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,520
Sorry. I...

672
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,959
It's all right.

673
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,874
The couch had a spring in it
or something, and my back...

674
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,996
Stop.

675
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,479
It's all right.

676
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,714
I don't mind.

677
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,752
Sir, I heard from my friend.

678
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,360
Missing Persons.

679
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,670
And?

680
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,955
She's in New York.

681
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,309
What hotel?

682
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,993
Not a hotel, sir.

683
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,753
So she's not alone?

684
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,675
No, sir.

685
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,679
Adam Galloway?

686
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,080
Yes, sir.

687
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,432
I have more information.
I don't need to know.

688
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,472
Turn on 1160 AM.

689
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,195
<i>He's running to fill Jim Matthews' old
post as Governor of Pennsylvania.</i>

690
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,954
<i>Glad to have you with us, sir.</i>

691
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,872
<i>It's good to be here, Jim.</i>

692
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,872
<i>It's Mark.</i>

693
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,878
<i>Sorry. Right. Mark.</i>

694
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,599
<i>That's okay, Congressman.
It happens</i>

695
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,359
<i>all the time this
early in the morning.</i>

696
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,397
<i>So, Congressman,
the Watershed Act.</i>

697
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,276
Yes. Uh, I'm ashamed of the...

698
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,438
Well, I'm not ashamed.
That's not the right...

699
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,399
I'm disappointed,
because, you know...

700
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,112
The water is...

701
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,635
It's... Actually, what I'd
like to discuss is...

702
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,792
We all know that natural gas...

703
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,510
That it's... It's a growing...
In our state...

704
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,990
It's a...
It's a big part of, um...

705
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:50,152
Economically,
the way things are going.

706
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,711
And I'd like to say...
To announce...

707
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,473
In terms of...

708
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:59,637
Are you familiar with
drilling regulations?

709
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,717
Permitted use
versus conditional use?

710
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,391
<i>Are we still talking
about the Watershed?</i>

711
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,278
<i>No. Drilling. Natural gas.</i>

712
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,431
<i>Sir, you supported
increased regulation.</i>

713
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,591
<i>Well, no. I... I...</i>

714
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,751
<i>It may have
looked that way, but...</i>

715
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,991
<i>In fact, to be clear,
I'm for less...</i>

716
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,680
Regulation.

717
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,952
<i>Yes, sir. In the Watershed Bill,
the language clearly stated...</i>

718
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,997
It didn't pass.

719
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,549
<i>Well, right. That's
what I'm asking about.</i>

720
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,994
What about it?

721
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,440
<i>Why it didn't pass?</i>

722
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,795
I just said.

723
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,712
<i>No, sir. I don't think you did.</i>

724
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,273
It just didn't.

725
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,800
<i>Sir, three days ago,
you predicted...</i>

726
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,599
I'm talking about
fucking natural gas.

727
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,236
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

728
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,516
<i>Congressman, I have to
ask you a question,</i>

729
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,796
<i>and it may come
across as indelicate,</i>

730
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,712
<i>but are you drunk right now?</i>

731
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,634
<i>What? No. No.
I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

732
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,240
<i>I'm just... I'm really
tired, you know?</i>

733
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,800
<i>I've been on the campaign
trail for a few weeks now...</i>

734
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,552
<i>Congressman?</i>

735
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,553
<i>Congressman? Congressman?</i>

736
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,796
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have let you.

737
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,519
I'm fucked.

738
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,831
Okay. Listen. We sober you up.

739
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,596
We'll make some kind of
announcement as soon as possible.

740
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,270
There's nothing I can say.

741
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,477
We'll figure this out.

742
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,630
Come on.

743
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,677
You're gonna take a shower.

744
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,194
Come on.

745
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,597
There you go. Come on.

746
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,270
<i>How bad is it?</i>

747
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,790
It all depends
on whether it gets

748
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,115
picked up by
the mainstream press.

749
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,276
<i>Well, shall I fill
in the President?</i>

750
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,470
No. Hold off on that.

751
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,721
I need to speak to Peter,
coordinate with his campaign.

752
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,040
You'll be
the first call I make.

753
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,914
Uh, Frank, before you go, I
got an email this morning.

754
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,480
Stanford reversed
their decision.

755
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,880
That's wonderful.

756
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,634
The Provost said Gillian
Cole reached out to him.

757
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,315
I googled her.
She works for Claire.

758
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,116
<i>Thank you.</i>

759
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,276
No reason to thank me.

760
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,353
<i>Ruben was just ecstatic. I don't
know how I'm gonna repay you.</i>

761
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,671
The fact that your son is
happy is more than enough.

762
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,000
You'll keep me posted on Peter?

763
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,190
<i>You bet.</i>

764
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,476
Okay.

765
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:35,360
Hey, boss.

766
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,194
<i>Are you still with him? Yeah.</i>

767
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,236
<i>He's taking a shower.</i>

768
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,310
How're we looking?

769
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,471
Zoe Barnes
posted 10 minutes ago.

770
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,240
<i>It's already on The New
York Times website.</i>

771
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,519
<i>The kid is done.</i>

772
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,552
Have Nancy set up a meeting
with the Vice President.

773
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,835
Today if possible.

774
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,110
Will do.

775
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,550
<i>And keep an eye on Peter.
He's done his duty.</i>

776
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,558
<i>Let's get him back on his feet.
You got it.</i>

777
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,316
And now Jim Matthews comes to the
fore, though he doesn't know it yet.

778
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,040
He will find solace in his
beloved Pennsylvania,

779
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,589
though Peter Russo will
find solace nowhere.

780
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,997
It only takes 10 seconds to
crush a man's ambitions.

781
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,878
I need to take care
I protect mine.

782
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,110
Peter.

783
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,150
Peter!

784
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,315
Peter?

785
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,556
Hey!
