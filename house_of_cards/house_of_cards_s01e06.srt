1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,076
<i>We're almost a month
into the strike,</i>

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,280
<i>and we've got millions of
kids stuck home from school.</i>

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,357
<i>Do you blame the White
House or Congress?</i>

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,079
<i>I personally have very little
sympathy for the teachers.</i>

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,431
<i>We're over three weeks
into this strike.</i>

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,876
<i>It's costing the country
billions of dollars,</i>

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,076
<i>and instead of
offering solutions...</i>

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,356
<i>There's a big
difference between</i>

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,238
<i>taking a stand and
sitting on your hands.</i>

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,874
<i>I don't know whether to
call it cowardice...</i>

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,030
<i>It's his agenda.</i>

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,233
<i>And the problem is that he stole
sound, conservative ideas.</i>

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,198
<i>The only smart thing
he's done is lift</i>

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,238
<i>his platform from the
Republican platform.</i>

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,158
I admit it, Linda.
This got away from me.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,039
But we can't turn back time.
We have to hold our ground.

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,589
While our approval ratings
continue to nosedive?

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,281
Spinella and I
worked together for years

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,919
on dozens of
labor-related bills.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,911
I thought he'd be reasonable.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,996
Well, you were
wrong about that.

22
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,833
Well, I didn't think he'd be
insane enough to go on strike,

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,752
and I didn't think the
strike would last this long.

24
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,320
So you've been
wrong twice about this.

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,033
Why should I believe you're
right about holding out?

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,157
We threatened collective
bargaining in order to get

27
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,594
performance standards
and charter funding.

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,354
That's the deal that we made.
We took that stand.

29
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,716
We lay down now,
we lose it all.

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,712
There'll be no reform,
just an empty bill.

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,476
I understand the logic, Frank,
but we're in damage control now.

32
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,155
But we can't close one
wound by opening another.

33
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,230
But we're the Democrats.

34
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,152
We're the ones who are supposed
to be defending the teachers.

35
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,674
But you can't have
it both ways, Linda.

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,558
You can't have
the reform you want

37
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,836
and keep the teachers
happy at the same time.

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
You knew that when we started.

39
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Okay, then if we
have to choose,

40
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,200
we choose to keep
the teachers happy.

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,560
That is a mistake, Linda. We've
already crossed the Rubicon.

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,960
I'm telling you this. The President
wants to change the bill.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,320
We should've done
it three weeks ago.

44
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,278
We didn't.
So you have to do it now.

45
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,636
Give me more time,
Linda, please.

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,279
If I can break
this strike and get

47
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,033
everything we
want in this bill,

48
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,351
can we agree that's
preferable to folding?

49
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,476
Of course.
If we can count on that...

50
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,791
Then count on me for
just one more week.

51
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,356
If the strike isn't over by
then, I'll change the bill.

52
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,556
Frank...

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
No. One more week. That's all.

54
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,194
This is the worst possible
position to be in.

55
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,239
If I water down the bill, the President
will still see me as a failure.

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,720
If the strike
doesn't end in a week,

57
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,280
I've forced
myself into a corner.

58
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,671
Only total victory will put
me back in his good graces.

59
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,194
The alternative is exile,

60
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,237
which would mean the last
five months were for nothing.

61
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,994
I cannot abide
falling back to square one.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,199
Does the Congressman
need me, ma'am?

63
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,795
No. I just was wondering if
you wanted a cup of coffee.

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,633
I just brewed a fresh pot.

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,915
I'm good, ma'am. But thanks.

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,230
Are you sure?

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,112
My shift's done in a couple hours.
I'll be fine.

68
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,520
You know, come on.
Stretch your legs.

69
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,239
I won't take no for an answer.

70
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,596
What did you do before you
joined the leadership detail?

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,673
I was a cop here in D.C.

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,150
Before that,
I was in the
Marines, ma'am.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,560
Thank you.

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,955
Did you serve overseas?

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,430
I did, ma'am.
Bahrain, then Afghanistan.

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,598
Served most of my second
tour in the Korengal Valley.

77
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,636
You wanna know if
I killed anyone?

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,351
I think I know the answer.

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
I got a dinner meeting with Birch.
I'll be...

80
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,192
I invited him in for coffee.

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,841
Well, drink it fast.
We leave in five...

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,955
Get down!
Stay away
from the windows!

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,390
Stop!

84
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,077
You'll have six of my best men
covering you around the clock.

85
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,391
I guess I'm wondering why
we didn't at least have

86
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,233
one of your best
men covering us now.

87
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,834
He'll be disciplined, sir.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,310
He shot a gun in a
residential neighborhood.

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,470
I want him fired.

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,710
There will be
a full investigation,

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,553
and we'll take
the necessary action.

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,673
Steve never
would've let
this happen.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,119
Is he better yet?
Because I would

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,799
feel a lot safer
if he was with us.

95
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,237
Unfortunately, he won't
be coming back, sir.

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,789
I thought he just had a
gallbladder infection.

97
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,678
He did, they found more.

98
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,070
His pancreas, stage four.

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,839
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
That's awful.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,240
How much longer does he have?

101
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,277
Not long. A few weeks.

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,599
At least that's
what his wife told me.

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,036
We have to go see him. Can you
get the information where he is?

104
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,961
Of course. I'll make sure
you get it right away.

105
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,320
Thank you, Captain. Thank you.

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,352
You're welcome. Good night.

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,000
Front door. Yes, sir.

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,595
Your weapon.

109
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,033
Your badge, too.

110
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,830
Am I suspended, sir?

111
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,072
You had a suspect on foot,
and you fire your gun?

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,071
Sir, I realize that...

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,156
Do you know how
this reflects on me?

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,311
That one of our men
could be so careless?

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,393
Not only do you abandon
your post for coffee.

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,279
You could've
killed a bystander.

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,161
That slug was found on
somebody's front stoop.

118
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,072
What if it went in their house?

119
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,633
Your badge, Meechum.

120
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,000
Two reasons, which are
really the same reason.

121
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,232
I was sick of
working for
other people,

122
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,710
and I knew I could do a
better job than my bosses.

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,712
They kept trying to suppress
me, shutting me out.

124
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,439
So I said, "Fuck it.
I'll do it my way."

125
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,795
And then you just quit?

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,280
Not like you did.

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,398
<i>I slaved away until I lined up
the money to start Slugline.</i>

128
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
<i>Once Slugline gets big
enough, what's the plan?</i>

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,919
Are you gonna
sell it like Arianna?

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,354
Probably. And then who knows?

131
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,400
Whatever the next adventure is.
Maybe Shanghai.

132
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,597
So I shouldn't expect to
have a job in two years?

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,910
Do you ever wanna have any
job for more than two years?

134
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,438
What about you?
What's your big plan?

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,510
Uh, I don't know yet.

136
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,559
<i>Come on. Slugline is just
a stepping stone for you.</i>

137
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,274
You know what?
I should take this.

138
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,840
Go. Do your thing.

139
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,196
Hey. Do you have proof
Spinella was behind it?

140
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,954
Put it in context. Three weeks into
a national teachers' strike...

141
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,600
At the home of Francis Underwood,
who has led the charge on...

142
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,512
There you go.
Now post that
before one of

143
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,472
my neighbors calls
a local 11:00 hack.

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,152
<i>When do I see you next?
I'm background on this.</i>

145
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,913
<i>I'm not your source.
You can't talk now?</i>

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,990
<i>No. When?</i>

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,793
Soon, with bells on.

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,991
What about "more school
books, less bricks"?

149
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,031
No, it's too broad. We
need a better sound bite.

150
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,191
Something specific,
something that

151
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,391
points the finger
directly at Spinella.

152
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,358
He'll deny any involvement.
Well, of course he will.

153
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,794
So how do we get around that?

154
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,281
We say he can't
control his troops.

155
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,476
There's no evidence
it was a teacher.

156
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,710
Who else could it be?

157
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,872
Look, he's gonna shift blame for
the strike back on Congress.

158
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,714
No. We need something
clear, something clean,

159
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,031
something that
sticks in your head.

160
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,552
"Teachers need a lesson
in self-restraint."

161
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,758
No. You're not hearing me.
People like teachers.

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,554
No. We need something that
makes Spinella the villain.

163
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,080
His lack of control,
his inability...

164
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,560
Disorganized labor.

165
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,318
<i>It's disorganized labor,
plain and simple.</i>

166
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,313
<i>When you've got angry
teachers throwing</i>

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,113
<i>bricks through
congressmen's windows,</i>

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,998
<i>you've gotta blame the
union leadership.</i>

169
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,239
We'll be beefing up the security
for the entire leadership.

170
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,673
And I strongly encourage Marty
Spinella to keep his people in line.

171
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,675
<i>This is starting to look
like disorganized labor.</i>

172
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,991
<i>Do you really think Marty
Spinella is to blame?</i>

173
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,916
<i>Whether Mr. Spinella
is behind this or not,</i>

174
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,838
<i>he might wanna tone
down the rhetoric,</i>

175
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,197
<i>before disorganized labor
turns into organized crime.</i>

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,872
No one can prove anything. So
that's the most cogent response.

177
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,073
Well, go on TV and say that. You
deplore violence in any form.

178
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,879
It's Congress that should
take responsibility.

179
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,191
I don't want to degenerate
to Frank's level.

180
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
We need to kill
this brick thing.

181
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,320
It's distracting
people from the issues.

182
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,470
She's right.

183
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,478
It'll eat up one cycle,
and it'll disappear.

184
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,597
No. This story is
getting traction.

185
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,121
Support for
the strike is dipping.

186
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,720
So is the President's
approval ratings.

187
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,280
But he gets to stay
in the Oval Office

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,720
another three years,
no matter what.

189
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,400
We can't afford
another three weeks.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,039
When I told
the unions to strike,

191
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,714
I told them to
prepare for the long haul.

192
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,156
All right? Their accounts
dry up, we keep going.

193
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,799
We figure it out.
I am not going

194
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,559
to blink over
something like this.

195
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
Fine. But if we lose the
public relations battle,

196
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,794
none of that does us any good.

197
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,116
Frank wants us
on the defensive.

198
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,318
I think this story
is going to blow over.

199
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,437
If I'm wrong, we'll reevaluate.

200
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,558
But I wanna give it another
day or two first. Okay?

201
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,195
Hi, Adam.

202
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,517
You all right? I saw the news.

203
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,590
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

204
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,593
<i>That's gotta rattle the nerves.</i>

205
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,678
<i>Brick coming
through the window.</i>

206
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,639
It did, some.

207
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,119
<i>So are you
staying in the house?</i>

208
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,032
<i>We've got extra
security now, so...</i>

209
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,914
Well, it made me think of you,
so I figured I'd just check in.

210
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,919
I appreciate that.

211
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,798
<i>We still haven't
talked, have we?</i>

212
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,233
There's no need to.
I think we should.

213
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,392
<i>Here's how I see it.</i>

214
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,518
<i>You asked me to
come down. I did.</i>

215
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,310
<i>We both had ideas about
what that could mean.</i>

216
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,477
Probably very similar ideas.

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,033
But then you changed your mind.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,559
<i>So be it.</i>

219
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,434
There's no reason we can't be
in touch or remain friends.

220
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,277
Let's not fool ourselves, Adam.

221
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,953
So I won't call again.

222
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,994
<i>Done. I'm not saying that.</i>

223
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,873
<i>What are you saying?</i>

224
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,199
I just called because
I care about you.

225
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,836
No agenda.

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,351
<i>If you wanna
talk again, call me.</i>

227
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,035
<i>If not, I understand.
It's up to you.</i>

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,594
You think I'm
being unreasonable?

229
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,752
I think you're doing whatever
it is you need to do,

230
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,069
and I'm not gonna question it.

231
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,279
It was sweet of you to call.

232
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,636
<i>Listen, you probably need
to get back to work.</i>

233
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,560
I know I do. I should go.

234
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,636
Yeah. Okay.

235
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,074
<i>Take care. Okay.</i>

236
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,039
Frank, you got a minute?

237
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,753
I'll see you inside.

238
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,194
I wanna be governor,
and I want your help.

239
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,915
Am I still on the short list?

240
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,275
You are.

241
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,393
I haven't had a drink in over a month.
I'm clean.

242
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,916
Is that because I asked, or
because it's what you want?

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,310
It was about time I took
responsibility for myself.

244
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,472
Taking responsibility is one
thing, and it's admirable.

245
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,273
But running for
governor of a major

246
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,073
state is a whole
nother ball game.

247
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,117
Let me tell you something, Frank.
I got elected to Congress

248
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,590
'cause I seized the moment
that opportunity struck.

249
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,673
You kept me on that list. I
wanna seize that opportunity.

250
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,074
If you help me out, I'll
give you everything I got.

251
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,157
Well, that's all I've
been waiting to hear.

252
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,389
All right. I'll tell you what.

253
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,199
I need to make some calls,
check in with some people.

254
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,509
Give me a few days.
I'll get back to you.

255
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,239
Of course. And, Peter...

256
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,995
I feel like I've met the real you
for the first time just now.

257
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,590
Janet.

258
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,273
Is this a bad time? No.

259
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,074
No, not at all.

260
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,032
I'm sorry. I didn't
know you were coming.

261
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,038
Here. Take my chair.

262
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,310
Oh, no. I'm fine.

263
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,590
I'll take these.

264
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,034
Thank you.

265
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,317
Hello, Steve. Hey.

266
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,995
These could use some water.
I'll be right back.

267
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,153
Francis and I were so
upset when we heard.

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,075
I'm sorry I
haven't come sooner.

269
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,152
I didn't want too
many people knowing.

270
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,310
Yes.

271
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,353
Francis wishes
he could be here.

272
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,393
He wants you to know
he's praying for you.

273
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,470
Couldn't make it, huh?

274
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,519
No, there's a big teachers'
strike going on right now,

275
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,752
and he's been stuck in
his office for weeks.

276
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,638
I get it. I saw the news.

277
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,510
The brick.

278
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,756
Right.

279
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,759
I told Francis
that probably wouldn't

280
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,519
have happened if
you were there.

281
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,593
No. Probably not.

282
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,838
I never seen him pray.

283
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,513
Not in eight years.

284
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,799
You said he was praying for me.

285
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,192
You've seen us in church.

286
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,040
Yeah, but I never went inside.

287
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,795
They're just gorgeous.

288
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,314
Mrs. Underwood,
thank you so much.

289
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,710
Please, call me Claire.

290
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,790
I know you got things to do.

291
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,870
Of course.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,676
If you need anything at all, call me.
You have my cell.

293
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,151
Anything at all. And I'm
sorry to have surprised you.

294
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,438
No. It was so
nice of you to come.

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,955
Thank you. I know
Steve appreciated it.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,836
Check this out.

297
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,150
It's foam.

298
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,320
How many of these we have?

299
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,874
200. But I can get more.

300
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,280
Get more.

301
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,440
Bring it on!

302
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,191
<i>You need to give the teachers
the respect they deserve.</i>

303
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,760
We can't back
away from this, Marty.

304
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,921
We've gotta face it head-on.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,116
They provoked us.

306
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,441
They were throwing foam. Our
guys were throwing punches.

307
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,079
We're gonna come
off the bad guys here.

308
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,470
Okay. Okay. I get it. I get it.

309
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,912
But I wanna be
smart about this.

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,640
I wanna do something definitive
that'll put this to bed

311
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,760
and get us back on message.

312
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,790
CNN.

313
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,193
One-on-one, you and Underwood.

314
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,555
8:00 tonight.

315
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,994
Frank is excellent in debates.

316
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,232
Go strong against him. Address
the brick right to his face.

317
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,310
End of story.

318
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,754
Underwood says
he's in if you are.

319
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,829
Okay. But I want as much
prep as possible, okay?

320
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,355
I want to run questions.

321
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,511
You moderate,
you play Underwood.

322
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
Wear this one.

323
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,754
Then come in here. I
wanna put powder on you.

324
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,991
Well, there's somebody at
the studio can do that.

325
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,914
Yes, and they always cake on too much.
I'm doing it.

326
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,392
War paint.

327
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,437
How bloody do
you think it'll be?

328
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,797
I think I oughta be able to
dispatch with him easily enough.

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,469
You remember Peter Russo?

330
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,677
He's doing well. He hasn't
had a drink in a month.

331
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,752
Good for him. I like him.

332
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,275
Good, because he
could use your help.

333
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,350
How?

334
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,470
We're running him for governor.

335
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,119
Ambitious.

336
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,920
Mm. We wanna create
jobs in his district.

337
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,798
It's on the Delaware River.

338
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,793
I thought we might be able
to put a bill together.

339
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,633
Something with
an economic upside.

340
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,951
This has to do with
the shipyard closing?

341
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,953
We need the shipbuilders'
support for his campaign.

342
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,078
You think you might be able to
draft a bill that he can sponsor?

343
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,994
I'm really trying to focus on
international projects, Francis.

344
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,719
Not domestic legislation.

345
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,599
I understand, but I could
really use your help, Claire.

346
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,239
Does Catherine
Durant still owe us?

347
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,080
When you make someone Secretary
of State, they owe you for life.

348
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,312
We're having trouble getting our water
filters through Sudanese customs.

349
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,436
I'll call from the car.

350
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,630
Tomorrow's fine.

351
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,710
I would have done that anyway.

352
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,870
I know.

353
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,195
I'm ready for battle.

354
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,555
You wanna come watch?

355
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,756
No. You go on ahead.

356
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,990
Come on.

357
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,470
Watch me put the final
nail in Spinella's coffin.

358
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,755
It'll be fun.

359
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,435
Marty.

360
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,790
Frank.

361
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,000
Come on, people.
Take your marks.

362
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,999
Congressman, would you
like to respond to that?

363
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,110
Yes, I would.

364
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,876
<i>$2 billion of taxpayers'
money being wasted.</i>

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,560
<i>And Congress should be ashamed
of itself for that, Frank.</i>

366
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,474
<i>What? Did Congress force the
teachers to go on strike, Marty?</i>

367
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,159
<i>No, we didn't. Really, Frank?</i>

368
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,517
<i>When you threaten teachers'
ability to negotiate as a union,</i>

369
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,512
<i>when you threaten
their job security,</i>

370
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,239
<i>you threaten their livelihood,</i>

371
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,039
<i>of course you
force them to strike.</i>

372
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,679
<i>And did we also
force them to start</i>

373
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,359
<i>throwing bricks
at people's houses?</i>

374
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,400
<i>You know what, I'm really
glad you brought that up,</i>

375
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,120
because you know there's
absolutely no proof that

376
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,237
that incident had anything
to do with this strike.

377
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,795
<i>And I wanna take the
opportunity to say publicly</i>

378
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,837
<i>that we categorically condemn</i>

379
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,230
<i>any use of violence
whatsoever, or intimidation.</i>

380
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,560
<i>What you're saying,
essentially,</i>

381
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,552
<i>is that you can't control
your own people.</i>

382
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,393
<i>That's not what I'm saying.
That is what you're saying.</i>

383
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,516
<i>You're disorganized.</i>

384
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,273
Disorganized labor.

385
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,398
You know what, you could keep trotting
out that phrase all you like,

386
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,075
but you know what I'd like to do, Frank?
I would like to get back

387
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,152
to the issue here of
educating our children

388
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,392
<i>and the fact that Congress is not
living up to their commitment.</i>

389
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,760
<i>Well, you know what
I would like?</i>

390
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,670
What?

391
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,753
<i>An apology.</i>

392
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,832
<i>If not to me, then to my wife.</i>

393
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,640
When that brick came through
our window, it was terrifying.

394
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,231
She's standing
right over there.

395
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,080
<i>Claire? We need camera
two on the wife.</i>

396
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,833
Now, why don't you
look her in the eye

397
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,834
and tell her that your people had
nothing to do with that brick.

398
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,279
<i>Are you serious? Yes.</i>

399
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,870
<i>Okay.</i>

400
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,592
<i>Mrs. Underwood, Claire,</i>

401
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,631
<i>I am sincerely sorry</i>

402
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,634
<i>that you had to go through
that ordeal, truly.</i>

403
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,639
<i>And it actually sickens me</i>

404
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,997
<i>that someone made you feel
unsafe in your own home.</i>

405
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,993
<i>And I give you my word that
to the best of my knowledge,</i>

406
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,596
<i>none of our people had
anything to do with it.</i>

407
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,320
<i>But you know what
sickens me more?</i>

408
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,517
<i>That right now, your
husband is using you</i>

409
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,355
as a prop on national television
to try and win a debate.

410
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,558
So I think you're the one that
owes your wife an apology, Frank.

411
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,960
And when you're
done apologizing,

412
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,878
can we please get
back to the issue here

413
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,314
of educating our children?

414
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,754
No. You've got
this wrong, Marty.

415
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,356
There is no "you"
and "I" in education.

416
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,035
Well, I mean,
yes, there's the letters,

417
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,793
"U" and "I" are in
the word education.

418
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,475
<i>But education
with a capital "E"...</i>

419
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,591
<i>You know what
I'm talking about.</i>

420
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,311
I don't think I do.

421
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,039
Yes, you do, Marty.

422
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,360
<i>"U" and "I", education.</i>

423
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
<i>So, we're gonna
waste the rest of</i>

424
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,115
<i>this debate naming
all the vowels in...</i>

425
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,714
<i>I'm happy to
play the vowel game.</i>

426
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,029
<i>You wanna play the
vowel game with me?</i>

427
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,919
<i>All right."U" think "I"</i>

428
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,600
<i>"O" "U"</i>

429
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,717
<i>"A" apology?</i>

430
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,513
But no, no, no.

431
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,594
"U" "O" "I."

432
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,713
Interesting. You left out
"E" for "Education."

433
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,280
<i>So let... Defecation.</i>

434
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,431
Edification. I'm sorry.

435
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,795
LOL. Uh...

436
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,999
<i>You like Sesame Street so much?</i>

437
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,560
Why don't you give the kids
the money they deserve?

438
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,553
<i>What I'm trying to say
about education...</i>

439
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,314
<i>Well, I guess school's
still in session.</i>

440
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,278
<i>I guess you schooled
me there, Marty.</i>

441
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,517
Let's move on. Please.

442
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,274
Humor aside, there are more
important issues out there.

443
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,595
I had no intention of
bringing you into this.

444
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,231
It wasn't part of a plan. I
would've told you if it was.

445
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,993
I know.

446
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,515
The idea just struck me,
and I went with it.

447
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,233
I don't mind
that you improvised.

448
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,551
I just wish
you'd done it better.

00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,520
Sit down. You want some coffee?

467
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,472
No, thanks. I'm good.

468
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,313
<i>Hey, did you see Bill
Maher last night?</i>

469
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,669
No, I didn't.

470
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,989
It was about the CNN thing.

471
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,912
I have to admit, Frank,
it was kind of funny.

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,151
Well, I'll have to
catch a rerun.

473
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,636
How you doing? You holding up
all right with the strike?

474
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,949
Let's talk about Pennsylvania.

475
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,114
I have your candidate.

476
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,591
Peter Russo.
1st Congressional District.

477
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
We crossed him off.

478
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,680
I know. It's a mistake.

479
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,797
He's young, he's
handsome. He's bright.

480
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,519
Nobody knows who he is
outside of Philadelphia.

481
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,990
There's no donor base,
no infrastructure.

482
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,231
You start me off with
funding from the DNC

483
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,840
and I'll raise
an army around this guy.

484
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,230
I will personally
oversee his campaign.

485
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,515
Is that the best we can do?

486
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,155
What's better than a blank
slate in the right hands?

487
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,035
Ed, you need to go.

488
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,077
Congressman,
do you have a moment?

489
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,150
Thank you, Patti.

490
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,469
Have him call me.

491
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,869
I will.

492
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,030
Ed? Please.

493
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,520
What is going on?
I'm taking care of it.

494
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,512
One second, sir. Please.

495
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,159
All right.
Make it fast, Meechum.

496
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,596
It's not easy
for me to ask this,

497
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,796
but I was
wondering if you could

498
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,160
put in a good
word with my boss.

499
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,390
A good word?

500
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,994
They're going to
discharge me, sir.

501
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,272
I messed up. I'm fully aware.

502
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,317
But my job,
it means
everything to me,

503
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,552
and I know a good
word from you would...

504
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,393
Look, I have nothing against
you personally, Meechum,

505
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,517
but I can't get involved
in these sort of affairs.

506
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,915
There's protocols and rules.

507
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,832
Sir, please,
if you spoke to Cardiff...

508
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,752
There is nothing that I can do.

509
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,117
If anyone could convince the Captain,
it would be you, Congressman.

510
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,514
I'm sorry. I wish you
all the best, Meechum.

511
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,796
Doug.

512
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,795
What did Barney Hull say?

513
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,314
That we'd be the first to know.

514
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,909
I can't believe there hasn't
been a single 911 call.

515
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,437
There's been plenty. It's just
not the sort we're after.

516
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,560
We got that kid in Atlanta.

517
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,831
No, it's got to be here. I
can't be getting on a plane.

518
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,280
It looks too opportunistic.

519
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,510
Maybe if we open
it up a little bit?

520
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,273
No, we cannot
lower our standards.

521
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,999
We just have to be patient.

522
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,759
<i>New rule. Now that
the debate's over,</i>

523
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,480
<i>Frank Underwood has to tell
us what the hell that was.</i>

524
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,111
<i>Seriously, Congressman,
was that a joke?</i>

525
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,272
<i>I haven't seen something just
lay there like that since...</i>

526
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,120
<i>I gotta go all the way
back to my prom night.</i>

527
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,831
<i>Can we just settle
this strike please?</i>

528
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,832
<i>Teachers have been out of
the classroom for so long,</i>

529
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,355
<i>middle-schoolers are starting
to have sex with each other.</i>

530
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,720
Enough.

531
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,076
I don't know why you had
it on in the first place.

532
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,553
I love you, Francis.

533
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,710
I know.

534
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,599
We should say that more
often to each other.

535
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,477
I need to clear my head.

536
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,192
North and east of the airport.

537
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,397
I'm gonna need that in
time for that meeting.

538
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,153
Peter, let's talk.

539
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,709
So. I've spoken to Patricia Whittaker.
She's on board.

540
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,078
You'll be getting $4 million in
start-up funding from the DNC.

541
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,231
I'll pick the team. You
announce in August.

542
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,233
But the campaign starts today.

543
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,674
Are you ready?

544
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,353
I've already put
together a platform.

545
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,352
It's mostly broad strokes,
but we can hone it.

546
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,877
Good. The first thing we need
to address is your sobriety.

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,150
You don't need to
worry about that.

548
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,391
Have you been
going to meetings?

549
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
You mean AA?

550
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,990
Yes.

551
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,241
That's not really my thing.

552
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,911
If you want my help,

553
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,993
then going to meetings
is my one requirement.

554
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,998
I know I had a problem, Frank.

555
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,639
I accept that.

556
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,240
And I've taken
responsibility for that,

557
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,312
but I don't think going
to meetings is necessary.

558
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,160
You cannot white-knuckle
your recovery, Peter.

559
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,153
This campaign will be the hardest
thing you've ever done in your life.

560
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,509
I realize that.
I'm prepared for that.

561
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,239
You think you are.

562
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,232
But we can't take any chances.

563
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,198
The party's investing in you.

564
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,792
I need to make sure you're
investing in yourself.

565
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,635
All right. I'll do
whatever I have to do.

566
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,949
Good. You'll start
tomorrow morning.

567
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,156
Doug will take you.

568
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,396
Stamper?

569
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,960
He's been sober 14 years.

570
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,360
Doug has a drinking problem?

571
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Had. Not anymore.
He'll be your sponsor.

572
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,958
In the meantime, I want you
to meet with my wife, Claire.

573
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,440
She runs the Clean
Water Initiative.

574
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,550
She's expecting you,

575
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,950
so clear your schedule
and head over there now.

576
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,030
Frank.

577
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
Thank you.

578
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,510
For believing in me.

579
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,109
You're gonna make a
great candidate, Peter.

580
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,000
The shipyard closing frees up
1,100 acres of federal land.

581
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,630
Our goal is to pass a Watershed
Act for the Delaware River.

582
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,390
We develop the land in an
environmentally responsible way,

583
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,039
creating jobs in the process.

584
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,679
How many jobs? Thousands.

585
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,951
We're aiming for
the $200 million mark.

586
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,069
We got a lot of work to do.

587
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,719
We do, but you can start
with the congressmen

588
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,917
whose districts fall
within the watershed.

589
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,400
Do you have a draft of the
bill you can show me?

590
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,876
We haven't sponsored any
environmental legislation.

591
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,717
We'll draft it in
consultation with your staff.

592
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,519
Gillian will be the point
person on our end.

593
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,353
I don't have any
legislation experience.

594
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,680
I'll help you.
When do we start?

595
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,995
We just did.

596
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,196
Will you introduce him
to the research team?

597
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,430
I'll be there in one second.

598
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,750
Sure.

599
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,480
Mr. President?

600
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,596
I want it over.

601
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,038
As soon as possible.
Gut the bill, Frank.

602
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Do whatever's
necessary to end this.

603
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,114
Mr. President,
if we give in now,

604
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,793
the public won't credit
you with a victory.

605
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,191
Not even a hollow one. They'll
chalk it up as a colossal defeat.

606
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,634
Well, that's on you, Frank.

607
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,475
You let this situation
devolve to where it is.

608
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,553
I've already been blamed for the largest
teachers' strike in U.S. history.

609
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,633
I won't be held accountable for
it dragging on months and months.

610
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,634
Mr. President, we have to end
this strike on your terms.

611
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,353
Not anyone else's. How?

612
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,356
By debating Marty
Spinella on CNN?

613
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,916
Sir, you have placed your
faith in me thus far.

614
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,793
I would ask that
you continue to do so.

615
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,481
Well, whatever you're
doing, Frank,

616
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,914
isn't working,
so I'm stepping in.

617
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,673
Gut the bill. Like Linda said.

618
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,830
No.

619
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,271
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but I will not do that.

620
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,516
Are you letting pride cloud
your judgment, Frank?

621
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,198
Respectfully, sir, you're
allowing fear to cloud yours.

622
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,794
Not an easy thing, to say no

623
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,076
to the most powerful
man in the free world.

624
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,039
But sometimes the only way to
gain your superior's respect

625
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,270
is to defy him.

626
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,955
What do we have on
the schedule, Linda?

627
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,918
Your meeting with the Fed
Oversight Committee.

628
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,036
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,554
Do you have my briefing?
Right here.

630
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,120
Good. Let's look it over.

631
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,071
Hi. How'd it go with Peter?

632
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,874
<i>It went well.</i>

633
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,032
Is he game? Completely.

634
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,716
<i>Thank you.</i>

635
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,280
<i>That's a big weight
off my shoulders.</i>

636
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,510
You sound tired.

637
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,393
Tired. Impatient.

638
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,440
<i>What can I do?</i>

639
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,353
Nothing. This one's up to fate.

640
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,872
I don't like when we
leave things to fate.

641
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,440
<i>Neither do I.</i>

642
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,875
Does that mean I'm gonna have
the bed to myself tonight?

643
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,475
Probably.

644
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,077
<i>Can't Doug man the fort?</i>

645
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,596
Well, he could, but I'd
just toss and turn.

646
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,070
If I'm not gonna sleep, I
might as well not sleep here.

647
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,277
<i>Well, I'll leave the ringer on.</i>

648
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,397
<i>Call me if you want company.</i>

649
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,279
I will. Good night.

650
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,680
<i>Good night.</i>

651
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,758
You should go home. I
could take it from here.

652
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,674
Vigilance.
It's good for the soul.

653
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,878
<i>10-59.
Corner of 16th and Q. 10-59.</i>

654
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,559
What's that?

655
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,359
Disorderly conduct.

656
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,115
Do you believe in karma?

657
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,470
Absolutely not.

658
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,156
Well, I do.

659
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,351
At least tonight.

660
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,720
Get Captain
Cardiff on the phone.

661
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,871
Let's do
something about Meechum.

662
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,872
What? Get him his job back.

663
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,469
He fired his weapon.

664
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,392
He overreacted.

665
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,597
Cardiff. On the phone. Now.

666
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,473
Nancy, give me
Captain Cardiff, please.

667
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,237
We might as well do one
productive thing while we wait.

668
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,997
It requires very little of me
and will mean the world to him.

669
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,753
It's a very
inexpensive investment.

670
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,035
Hello, sir.
This is Doug Stamper.

671
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,316
I have Francis
Underwood for you.

672
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,240
I got him on.

673
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,794
Captain, I know it's late,

674
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,554
but I'd like to talk to
you about Edward Meechum.

675
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,277
Good morning, gentlemen.

676
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,510
Thank you.

677
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,200
Thank you.

678
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,153
Are you hungry? Mm-hmm.

679
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,470
You have any
trouble getting in?

680
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,399
No, they made me put it through
the X-ray machine twice,

681
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,472
so I hope it
didn't overcook it.

682
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,080
Frank, you always pay too much.
This is way too much.

683
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,038
It's for the inconvenience.

684
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,198
You know, 20 years you
been coming to my joint.

685
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,840
This is the first
time I've been to yours.

686
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,950
What do you think?

687
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,829
I could get used to it.

688
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,160
Well, you're welcome any time.

689
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,190
Thank you, Freddy.

690
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,350
Always, Frank.

691
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,517
<i>We got a 27 Delta two.
446 3rd Street...</i>

692
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,750
That's a drive-by shooting.

693
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,075
Get details.

694
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,395
Sir, I want to thank you for
talking to the Captain.

695
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,911
He told me you called, and I can't
tell you how grateful I am.

696
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,997
I want you to
listen very closely

697
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,276
to what I'm about to say.

698
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,751
From this moment on,
you are a rock.

699
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,070
You absorb nothing,
you say nothing,

700
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,672
and nothing breaks you.

701
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,396
Is that clear?

702
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,596
Yes, sir.

703
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,720
Welcome back.

704
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,069
Steve?

705
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,799
I'll leave you be.

706
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,110
Where... Where's Janet?

707
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,520
She's been here every day
for the last few weeks.

708
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,549
I told her,
go home, get some rest.

709
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,756
Well, is everything okay?

710
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,957
Your text said
it was important.

711
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,276
I don't know how to put this.

712
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,073
The thing is, I...

713
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,194
I've been thinking.

714
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,430
A lot.

715
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,200
About my life.

716
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,640
About the things
I haven't done.

717
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,598
Things I haven't said.

718
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,033
I hate your husband.

719
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,513
A lot of people do.

720
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,992
The past eight years,
I watched over him.

721
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,191
But it wasn't
him I was watching.

722
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,115
And every time I saw you,

723
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,237
every time I heard your voice,

724
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,551
all I could
think to myself was,

725
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,758
"Jesus, what I wouldn't give."

726
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,040
I can't tell you how many
times I thought about that.

727
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,314
You know what Francis said
to me when he proposed?

728
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,071
I remember his exact words.

729
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,832
He said, "Claire, if all
you want is happiness,

730
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,199
"say no.

731
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,077
"I'm not gonna give
you a couple of kids

732
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,595
"and count the days
until retirement.

733
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,278
"I promise you
freedom from that.

734
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,194
"I promise you'll
never be bored."

735
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,600
You know, he was the only man,

736
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,319
and there were a lot of
others who proposed.

737
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,917
But he was the only
one who understood me.

738
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,351
He didn't put me
on some pedestal.

739
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,116
He knew that I didn't want
to be adored or coddled.

740
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,560
So he took my hand and
he put a ring on it.

741
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,957
Because he knew I'd say yes.

742
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,559
He's a man who knows how
to take what he wants.

743
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,473
Is this what you wanted?

744
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,353
Is that the way you wanted it?

745
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,033
Stop. Stop.

746
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,952
Please. Please. Stop.

747
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,790
Don't.

748
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,912
You told me your truth.

749
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,154
Now you know mine.

750
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,515
<i>Hey, it's Peter.</i>

751
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,354
<i>I don't expect
you to call me back,</i>

752
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,390
<i>but I wanted to let you know I
stopped drinking last night,</i>

753
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,120
<i>and I went to my first
AA meeting this morning.</i>

754
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,156
<i>I'm supposed to reach out and
make amends to those I've hurt.</i>

755
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,761
<i>But I guess the real
reason I called you</i>

756
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,713
<i>is just to say I love
you and I miss you.</i>

757
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,039
<i>I hope you're well.</i>

758
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,199
This is work, not play.

759
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,033
Then why'd you
bother coming over?

760
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,230
I was hoping you'd
answer the door naked.

761
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,876
That would be play.

762
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,873
That would be work with a view.

763
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,400
Sorry to disappoint.

764
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,312
How many characters in a tweet?

765
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,590
140.

766
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,639
Type this, let me know
where you land.

767
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,552
Eight-year-old
Washington D.C. boy

768
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,792
killed by a stray bullet
in gangland shoot-out.

769
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,153
61 characters left.

770
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,200
He should have been in school?

771
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,556
30 left.

772
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,438
Spinella to blame.
Question mark.

773
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,113
128. Press send.

774
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,269
Now give me a name, details.

775
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,432
Tyler Davis. Third-grader
at Vernon Baker Elementary.

776
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,275
Shot outside his home in Southeast
just before noon today.

777
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,997
Sent. Where are you going?

778
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,512
To see the mother.
You don't wanna...

779
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,751
There's work to do. I'll
see you later tonight.

780
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,072
<i>Tyler never did anything wrong.</i>

781
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,873
<i>He was a good boy.</i>

782
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,074
<i>Everybody loved him.</i>

783
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,674
<i>It's okay.</i>

784
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,359
<i>If Tyler's school had
been in session,</i>

785
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,154
<i>this senseless killing would
have never taken place.</i>

786
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,357
<i>We need to end this strike now</i>

787
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,353
<i>and get all our children back
in school where they belong,</i>

788
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,399
<i>before we risk another
death like this.</i>

789
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,030
<i>So, Mr. Spinella, I am headed
to the Capitol right now,</i>

790
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,232
<i>and I will remain there until
you are ready to meet and talk</i>

791
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,789
<i>so that we can end
this pointless strike.</i>

792
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,639
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

793
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,518
<i>Let's go back inside.</i>

794
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,875
Mr. Spinella, one question.

795
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,156
Mr. Spinella is not gonna
make comments at this time.

796
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,516
No comment. No comment.

797
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,120
Thank you.

798
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,510
Frank.

799
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,190
So?

800
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,317
You said you wanted to talk.

801
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,956
You said you wanted to
work out a compromise.

802
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,793
I lied.

803
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,870
Excuse me?

804
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:25,350
I have no intention of
working out a compromise.

805
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,554
So then why the fuck
are we here, Frank?

806
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,429
What the hell's
the matter with you?

807
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,040
You think this is
some kind of a game?

808
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,196
No.

809
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,715
These are real people
with families to feed.

810
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,549
Would you please stop that?

811
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,754
Stop what?

812
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,396
In five seconds,
I'm out of here.

813
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,439
One.

814
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,954
Two.

815
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,954
Three.

816
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,118
Four. Goodbye, Frank.

817
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,432
You know the difference
between you and me, Marty?

818
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,716
What?

819
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,156
I'm a white-trash cracker
from a white-trash town

820
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,272
that no one would
even bother to piss on.

821
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,476
But here's the difference.

822
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,835
I've made something of myself.

823
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,991
I have the keys to the Capitol.
People respect me.

824
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,918
But you, you're still nothing.

825
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,670
You're just an uppity
dago in an expensive suit

826
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,274
turning tricks for the unions.

827
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,272
Nobody respects
the unions anymore, Marty.

828
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,512
They're dying.
And no one respects you.

829
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,593
The most you'll
ever make of yourself

830
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,189
is blowing men like me.

831
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,033
Men with real power.

832
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:48,070
Yes. I can smell the cock
on your breath from here.

833
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,279
You think you can
get under my skin?

834
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,113
I know I can. Yeah.

835
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,113
Kiss my ass, Frank.

836
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,597
You can't afford
to walk out.
Watch me.

837
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,878
I've got a dead, underprivileged
kid in my pocket.

838
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,792
What do you have?

839
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,634
I have two million
honorable teachers.

840
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,269
Fair enough. But I got
something even better.

841
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,156
Go ahead. Open it.

842
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,870
Okay.

843
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,354
I'll play your game.

844
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,630
You're an idiot.

845
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,519
Stamper threw it.

846
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,200
You're full of shit.

847
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,919
Oh no, Stamper threw the brick.

848
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,919
And I made sure Claire
distracted my security.

849
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,239
Are you kidding me?

850
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,315
And to think you wanted me
to apologize to my wife.

851
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,312
You would do
something that low, Frank?

852
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,754
I arranged the brick, Marty,

853
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,277
just like I arranged this
meeting this afternoon.

854
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,476
Back off, Frank.

855
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,239
Why don't you just
get down on your knees

856
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,390
where you really belong?

857
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,630
Back off, Frank.

858
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,757
Because the only thing
you're gonna get from me

859
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,797
is cum on your... Fuck you!

860
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,712
Everything okay in there, sir?

861
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,431
Look, I'll tell
them you provoked me.

862
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,716
I'll tell them that you
threw the brick yourself.

863
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,638
And who's going to believe you?

864
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,235
You just assaulted a
United States Congressman,

865
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,232
which is a felony.

866
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,677
But I'm not gonna
press charges, Marty.

867
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,077
Because the strike ends now.

868
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,273
You think it'll leave a scar?

869
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,273
I have a thick skin.

870
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,556
The next time you ask me to
invite someone in for coffee,

871
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,951
will you please make
sure no guns go off?

872
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,633
I'll do my best.

873
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,792
I saw Steve again today.

874
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:37,876
How is he?

875
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,950
In a lot of pain.

876
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,634
Should I go see him?

877
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,798
I don't think you need to.

878
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,554
Zoe Barnes.

879
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,038
When he dies,
we'll pay for his funeral.

880
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,633
You don't need to take it?

881
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:00,756
No.

882
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,152
I'm done with work today.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
